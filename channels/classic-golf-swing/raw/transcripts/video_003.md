## Full Transcript

hi I'm Christo Garcia the founder of my swing evolution a few years ago I wanted to rebuild my golf swing so I picked up Ben Hogan's five lessons book guess what it changed my life today I've got the game I've always dreamed of I'm sponsored by the Ben Hogan golf equipment company and I even got to swing as Ben Hogan in a special on the Golf Channel and in this video series I'm going to teach you the most important things I learned from Ben Hogan's five lessons and mr. Hogan's famous book the third chapter is the first part of the swing I just call it the backswing and the most important thing that I learned about the backswing was to keep my rear leg braced yes this rear leg is going to be the brace for the trail side of my body as I turn around it like a post if my leg is going all over the place I'm not going to be able to find a consistent position at the top of my backswing so if you can learn to brace your rear leg you're gonna be in a much better position as you take the golf club back now mr. Hogan took the club back in an order that was very clear he had a little caddy drag okay that means he had a little flexibility in his wrists so he would start with his hands first and then the arms then the shoulders would turn and last the hips would turn around as he took the club back on that famous plane that were so familiar with mr. Hogan believed that there was a pane of glass from the golf ball up across his shoulders that gave him a sense of where the club needs to be he didn't want to break that pane of glass he wanted to keep the club underneath it that keeps the club on more of a single plane rather than reaching up high and bringing the club into a secondary plane over the shoulders now I was having trouble with us in the beginning and Roger done the famous Southern California golf teacher and store owner suggested to me take your lead hand and reach in the pocket of your opposite hip suffice to say it worked and I haven't looked back since then and finally the most important thing I learned about the backswing was to allow my hips to open on the backswing and mr. Hogan talks about the importance of the lead leg breaking in towards the rear leg now we don't want the knee to poke out towards the ball we want it to break in towards the other leg which allows the foot to roll to the instep on the backswing he wasn't too worried about lifting the heel really high off the ground he wanted the foot to roll in and that's what caused the heel to lift so i really suggest you allow your hips to open on the backswing this is going to allow you to have a longer swing and it'll give you more time to execute a great delivery into the golf ball so if you'd like to learn more about how I swing the golf club go to my swing evolution comm and check out the my swing evolution golf system and if you'd like to check out the best golf clubs in the world for the price go to Ben Hogan golf and I've got a link in the description box below hit him long and hit him straight
