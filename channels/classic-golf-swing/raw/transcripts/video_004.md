[0:00] hi I'm Christo Garcia the founder of my swing evolution a few years ago I wanted to rebuild my golf swing so I picked up Ben Hogan's five lessons book guess what it changed my life today I've got the game I've always dreamed of I'm sponsored by the Ben Hogan golf equipment company and I even got to swing as Ben Hogan and a special on the Golf Channel and in this video series I'm going to teach you the most important things I learned from Ben Hogan's five lessons

[0:28] the fourth part of mr. Hogan's book is all about the downswing and what he said that was so important was that the hips initiate the downswing now we all remember from his famous video on shells wonderful world of golf that he said the swing is down below with the knees and the hips

[0:53] so we have to make sure that we make a lateral weight shift to our lead foot that's what mr. Hogan emphasized in the five lessons there has to be enough of a weight transfer to get the weight onto the lead side of our body this is going to give us the space we need to allow the lower body to open up as it pulls the shoulders arms and club head through the strike

[1:19] I used to have a lot of trouble with fat shots and thin shots and then I realized how important this weight transfer really is it determines where the bottom of your swing arc is going to be so if you're having inconsistency with fat and thin shots I really advise you take a little time to focus on your weight shift and feel where it is between your feet and the ground it's gonna make it possible to hit the ball much more solidly

[1:49] now one of the great suggestions that mr. Hogan had was imagine there is a piece of elastic strap to your lead hip so you can feel it snap back as you make your downswing well I came up with a simple way to feel this by simply taking our lead hand and reaching across our body and grabbing on to our belt this little drill gives me the feeling exactly of what I want with the hips leading the shoulders arms and club head into the strike zone so give it a try I bet it'll help you ingrain the perfect feeling on the downswing

[2:25] so if you'd like to learn more about how I swing the golf club go to my swing evolution dot-com and check out the my swing evolution golf system and if you'd like to check out the best golf clubs in the world for the price go to Ben Hogan golf and I've got a link in the description box below hit him long and hit him straight
