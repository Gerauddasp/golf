[0:00] hi I'm Christo Garcia the founder of my swing evolution a few years ago I wanted to rebuild my golf swing so I picked up Ben Hogan's five lessons book guess what it changed my life today I've got the game I've always dreamed of I'm sponsored by the Ben Hogan golf equipment company and I even got to swing as Ben Hogan in a special on the Golf Channel and in this video series I'm going to teach you the most important things I learned from Ben Hogan's five lessons

[0:28] the second chapter in Ben Hogan's book is all about stance and posture now this is often overlooked by many average golfers however I believe 90% of the shot is taken care of before you ever take the club back can you believe it well it's true we want to build the swing into our stance and if we have everything ready to go all we have to do is two turns in a swoosh and the shots gonna take care of itself

[1:06] the first thing I changed with my golf stance after reading five lessons was I made sure that my trail foot was at a 90 degree angle to the target line I want my toes basically pointing straight ahead of me with my trail foot with my lead foot I want my toes turned out slightly about a quarter of a turn is what mr. Hogan says

[1:34] now the second most important thing that's absolutely crucial I've found in the golf swing is to feel the weight more in the heels than the balls of the feet my weight always swung forward in the golf swing as I swung the golf club around me it would pull my weight towards my toes which is always a big problem because I lost my balance but if we can learn to have our weight through our heels we're gonna be in a much better position to put the club in orbit around our body

[2:02] now the most important thing to remember from this point on is to feel the weight more in your heels rather than the balls of your feet and a actually your toes we want to feel our weight deep through our heels by making sure our weight isn't too far forward we're going to be able to maintain our balance throughout the course of the swing much much better

[2:29] now mr. Hogan talked about feeling the muscles on the insides of the arms and the insides of the legs as we swing the golf club so we held his upper arms against the sides of his chest you'll see a lot of pros practicing with a glove underneath one of their armpits or both of their armpits with a towel so this is something that I want you to feel when you're working on this setup as you prepare to swing the golf club

[2:57] now remember you can take care of most of the golf swing before you ever take the golf club back as long as you have a great stance and adhere to these address fundamentals so if you'd like to learn more about how I swing the golf club go to my swing evolution comm and check out the my swing evolution golf system and if you'd like to check out the best golf clubs in the world for the price go to Ben Hogan golf and I've got a link in the description box below hit him long and hit him straight
