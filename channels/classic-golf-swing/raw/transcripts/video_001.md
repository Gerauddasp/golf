## Raw Transcript

[0:00] hi I'm Christo Garcia the founder of my

[0:03] swing evolution a few years ago I wanted

[0:06] to rebuild my golf swing so I picked up

[0:08] Ben Hogan's five lessons book guess what

[0:11] it changed my life today I've got the

[0:14] game I've always dreamed of I'm

[0:16] sponsored by the Ben Hogan golf

[0:18] equipment company and I even got to

[0:20] swing as Ben Hogan and a special on the

[0:23] Golf Channel and in this video series

[0:25] I'm going to teach you the most

[0:26] important things I learned from Ben

[0:28] Hogan's five lessons

[0:32] mr. Hogan began his book talking about

[0:35] the grip and that's a great place to

[0:37] start because your hands are the only

[0:39] thing that has contact with the golf

[0:42] club so first I'm going to talk about

[0:45] our lead hand in the golf swing

[0:48] mr. Hogan makes a great demonstration in

[0:51] the book where he holds the golf club

[0:53] like so with it held in the crook of his

[0:57] first finger now this is a pretty

[0:59] important position to feel when you hold

[1:02] the golf club and the reason why is

[1:05] because it places the golf club across

[1:08] the palm of the lead hand I used to hold

[1:12] the club too much in my fingers but once

[1:15] I learned how to hold the club like this

[1:16] I realized it put the club in a much

[1:19] better position in my hand and it

[1:22] allowed me to arch the lead wrist much

[1:25] better this puts the forearm and the

[1:28] club in more of one direct line as

[1:31] opposed to having the club in more of an

[1:34] L shape like this so I highly recommend

[1:37] that you give this a try hold the golf

[1:39] club in the crook of this lead finger

[1:41] and feel the balance of the club across

[1:44] the lead palm now with your trail hand

[1:49] mr. Hogan really felt it between these

[1:51] two fingers it's more of a finger grip

[1:54] as opposed to the palm grip of the left

[1:57] hand so I call these my bruce lee

[1:59] fingers yeah it's kind of like how he

[2:02] held the nunchucks right so if you can

[2:05] combine the club across the palm of the

[2:08] lead hand and then hold the club and

[2:11] more of the fingers of the trail hand

[2:13] you're gonna be able to put your hands

[2:15] on the golf club in a secure way that's

[2:18] going to help you hit the ball more

[2:20] consistently time after time now one

[2:23] word of caution with the hands mr. Hogan

[2:26] warned that the trail hand these two

[2:28] fingers he called them the swing

[2:31] wreckers so you want to be focused more

[2:33] on these fingers and this pressure point

[2:36] in this hand if your fingers are getting

[2:39] involved in the action of the release of

[2:42] the club head you could be in deep deep

[2:44] trouble I've found myself jerking and

[2:47] squeezing with these two fingers too

[2:50] hard and it can ruin an otherwise good

[2:53] golf swing so be wary of the swing

[2:55] wreckers and focus more on the pressure

[2:57] point under this knuckle so if you can

[3:01] remember to hold this golf club across

[3:02] the palm of the lead hand and keep the

[3:05] club securely held in the fingers of the

[3:09] trail hand and don't let the swing

[3:11] Wreckers get involved you're gonna be

[3:13] able to swing the club more consistently

[3:15] time after time so if you'd like to

[3:19] learn more about how I swing the golf
