## Raw Transcript

hi I'm Christo Garcia the founder of my swing evolution a few years ago I wanted to rebuild my golf swing so I picked up Ben Hogan's five lessons book guess what it changed my life today I've got the game I've always dreamed of I'm sponsored by the Ben Hogan golf equipment company and I even got to swing as Ben Hogan and a special on the Golf Channel and in this video series I'm going to teach you the most important things I learned from Ben Hogan's five lessons the fifth chapter of mr. Hogan's book was a summary and review of the most important elements in the five lessons now the most important takeaway that I took from it is he emphasizes that he didn't get really good until he stopped trying to do a lot of things perfectly but rather if he could just execute a few simple principles very well that's where the secret was to improving your golf swing so to summarize let's remember we want to have a correct grip on the golf club okay across the palm of our lead hand and in the fingers of our rear hand next we want to have a great stance where our rear foot is pointed straight ahead our lead foot is slightly open and feel the weight slightly more towards the heels rather than the balls of the feet we want to have a nice relaxed takeaway with our hands leading the arms leading the shoulders and then last the hips and we swing that up through our shoulder under that pane of glass next we want to have a great backswing so brace that rear leg caddie drag that Club up underneath your shoulder and find balance at the top of your backswing let's make a smooth transition and remember the downswing begins below with the knees and the hips we have to transfer our weight laterally to our lead leg this is going to give us the space that we need to be able to rotate our lower body out of the way which will then pull our shoulders arms and the club head through the strike zone and always try to find a balanced finish at the top of your follow-through so remember to focus on your fundamentals they will determine how far you can go with your game of golf so if you'd like to learn more about how I swing the golf club go to my swing evolution comm and check out the my swing evolution golf system and if you'd like to check out the best golf clubs in the world for the price go to Ben Hogan golf and I've got a link in the description box below hit him long and hit him straight
