# Video 001: BEN HOGAN 5 LESSONS #1 The Grip

**YouTube ID**: xuaLmnVcU9A
**Duration**: 3:48
**Instructor**: Christo Garcia (Ben Hogan Method)
**Series**: Ben Hogan's Five Lessons - Part 1 of 5

## Overview

This is the foundational lesson in Ben Hogan's classic instructional series, focusing exclusively on grip fundamentals. Christo Garcia presents Hogan's precise grip methodology, emphasizing the critical difference between how each hand holds the club. The lead hand uses a palm grip while the trail hand employs a finger grip. This video introduces one of Hogan's most important warnings: the concept of "swing wreckers" - specific fingers in the trail hand that can destroy an otherwise solid golf swing if used improperly.

This lesson establishes the first building block in Hogan's systematic approach to the golf swing, where proper hand placement creates the foundation for all subsequent movements.

## Key Principles

### The Hands Are Everything
- Your hands are the ONLY point of contact with the golf club
- Proper grip is the foundation of a consistent golf swing
- The grip must be secure yet controlled
- Each hand has a distinct and different role

### The Two-Grip System
- **Lead Hand**: Palm-based grip providing stability and control
- **Trail Hand**: Finger-based grip providing feel and release
- These two different grips must work together as one unit
- The contrast between palm and fingers is intentional and critical

### Sequential Building Block
- Hogan's method builds the swing step-by-step
- Lesson 1 (Grip) must be mastered before moving forward
- The grip influences every subsequent position in the swing
- Bad grip = bad swing, regardless of other fundamentals

## Step-by-Step Grip Instructions

### Lead Hand Setup (Left Hand for Right-Handed Golfers)

**Step 1: The Crook of the First Finger**
1. Hold the club vertically in front of you with your trail hand
2. Place the club shaft in the crook (base) of your lead hand's first finger
3. Let the club rest diagonally across this junction point
4. This initial placement is the key to everything that follows

**Step 2: Across the Palm**
1. The club should run diagonally across the palm of your lead hand
2. NOT primarily in the fingers (common mistake)
3. The club crosses from the crook of the first finger through the heel pad
4. This palm placement allows for proper wrist position

**Step 3: Lead Wrist Arch**
1. Close your hand around the club
2. The lead wrist should form a slight arch (convex on back of wrist)
3. This creates a straight-line relationship between forearm and club shaft
4. Avoid an "L-shaped" relationship between forearm and club
5. The arch puts the forearm and club in "one direct line"

**Key Checkpoint**: Look down at your lead hand - you should see the club running through your palm, not primarily in your fingers. The wrist should be slightly arched, NOT cupped or flat.

### Trail Hand Setup (Right Hand for Right-Handed Golfers)

**Step 1: "Bruce Lee Fingers"**
1. Focus on the middle two fingers of your trail hand (middle and ring fingers)
2. These fingers provide the primary grip pressure in the trail hand
3. The grip is felt predominantly between these two fingers
4. Think of how Bruce Lee held nunchucks - controlled finger grip

**Step 2: Finger Grip (Not Palm)**
1. The trail hand holds the club in the FINGERS
2. This is opposite to the lead hand's palm grip
3. The fingers wrap around the club
4. The palm may make light contact but doesn't provide primary support

**Step 3: Pressure Point Under Knuckle**
1. Feel a pressure point under the trail hand knuckle
2. Focus your attention on this specific spot
3. This pressure point helps guide the club properly
4. Keep awareness on this point throughout the swing

### The Combined Grip

1. Lead hand across the palm + Trail hand in the fingers
2. Both hands work as one unified connection to the club
3. Secure enough to control the club
4. Relaxed enough to allow proper release
5. The contrast between palm (lead) and fingers (trail) is essential

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Lead Hand Too Much in Fingers
**Problem**: Holding the club primarily in the fingers of the lead hand
**Result**:
- Creates an "L-shape" between forearm and club
- Prevents proper wrist arch
- Reduces control and power
- Makes consistent contact difficult

**Fix**: Place club in the crook of the first finger and run it diagonally through the palm

### Mistake #2: The "Swing Wreckers"
**Problem**: Over-involvement of the trail hand's pinky and ring fingers (the outer two fingers)
**Hogan's Warning**: These are the "swing wreckers"
**Result**:
- Jerking motion in the swing
- Over-squeezing at impact
- Premature release or "casting"
- Inconsistent ball striking
- Can "ruin an otherwise good golf swing"

**Fix**:
- Focus pressure on the middle two fingers (middle and ring)
- Keep the outer two fingers (pinky and ring) passive
- Be aware of the pressure point under the knuckle
- Don't let these fingers "get involved in the action of the release"

### Mistake #3: Trail Hand in Palm
**Problem**: Trying to match the lead hand's palm grip with the trail hand
**Result**:
- Loss of feel and control
- Reduced ability to release the club properly
- Tension in the hands and forearms

**Fix**: Keep trail hand grip in the fingers, contrasting with the lead hand's palm grip

### Mistake #4: Equal Pressure in All Fingers
**Problem**: Gripping with uniform pressure across all fingers
**Result**:
- Excessive tension
- Loss of clubhead feel
- Restricted swing motion

**Fix**: Focus pressure on specific points - lead hand palm and trail hand middle two fingers

## Key Checkpoints

### Lead Hand Checkpoints
✓ Club runs through the crook of the first finger
✓ Club lies diagonally across the palm
✓ Lead wrist shows a slight arch (convex back)
✓ Forearm and club form nearly one straight line
✓ NOT an L-shaped relationship

### Trail Hand Checkpoints
✓ Primary grip felt between middle two fingers ("Bruce Lee fingers")
✓ Club held in fingers, not palm
✓ Pressure point felt under the knuckle
✓ Outer two fingers (swing wreckers) remain passive
✓ No jerking or squeezing sensation

### Combined Grip Checkpoints
✓ Both hands feel unified on the club
✓ Secure but not overly tight
✓ Lead hand = palm grip, Trail hand = finger grip
✓ Awareness of the swing wreckers remains throughout
✓ Grip allows for natural release

## Integration: Building Block #1

### Why the Grip Comes First
- Hogan's systematic approach starts with the foundation
- The grip influences stance, posture, and swing plane
- Bad grip creates compensations throughout the swing
- Proper grip allows all other fundamentals to work correctly

### Connection to Upcoming Lessons
This grip setup prepares you for:
- **Lesson 2**: Stance and posture alignment
- **Lesson 3**: The backswing motion
- **Lesson 4**: The downswing and impact
- **Lesson 5**: Putting it all together

### Practice Progression
1. **Week 1-2**: Master the lead hand placement (crook of finger, across palm, arched wrist)
2. **Week 2-3**: Add the trail hand (Bruce Lee fingers, pressure point, avoid swing wreckers)
3. **Week 3-4**: Combine both hands, building muscle memory
4. **Ongoing**: Constant awareness of swing wreckers during practice swings

### The Grip Test
Before each practice session and round:
1. Check lead hand placement in the crook of the first finger
2. Verify club runs through the palm, not fingers
3. Confirm lead wrist arch is present
4. Feel trail hand grip in the middle two fingers
5. Ensure swing wreckers stay passive
6. Take practice swings monitoring these points

## Hogan's Philosophy in This Lesson

### Precision Matters
- Exact placement of the club in the hands
- Specific fingers responsible for specific tasks
- Clear distinction between palm grip and finger grip
- Nothing is arbitrary in Hogan's method

### Build from the Ground Up
- Start with grip before anything else
- Master each fundamental before moving forward
- Sequential learning creates lasting improvement
- Shortcuts lead to long-term problems

### Awareness and Feel
- Know exactly where the club sits in your hands
- Feel the pressure points that matter
- Develop sensitivity to the swing wreckers
- Conscious practice becomes unconscious competence

## Key Takeaways

1. **The Club Crosses the Lead Hand's Palm** - Hold it in the crook of the first finger and let it run diagonally through the palm, NOT primarily in the fingers. This allows the wrist to arch properly.

2. **Trail Hand is a Finger Grip** - Feel the club between the middle two fingers (Bruce Lee fingers) with a pressure point under the knuckle. The trail hand grip contrasts completely with the lead hand.

3. **Beware the Swing Wreckers** - The outer two fingers of the trail hand (pinky and ring) can destroy your swing if they get over-involved. Keep them passive and focus on the middle two fingers instead.

4. **Palm vs. Fingers Creates Unity** - The lead hand's palm grip combined with the trail hand's finger grip creates a secure, unified connection that allows for proper release and consistent ball striking.

5. **The Grip Is the Foundation** - Everything in Hogan's system builds from this grip. Master this first before moving to stance, posture, or swing mechanics.

6. **Forearm and Club Form One Line** - The proper lead hand grip with arched wrist creates a straight-line relationship between forearm and club, eliminating the weak "L-shape" position.

7. **Consistency Comes from Proper Hand Placement** - Time after time, shot after shot, the grip must be identical. This consistency in the hands translates to consistency in ball striking.
