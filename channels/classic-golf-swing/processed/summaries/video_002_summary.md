# Video 2: BEN HOGAN 5 LESSONS #2 The Stance

**YouTube ID**: s91ulZG3lEQ
**Duration**: 3:38
**Series**: Ben Hogan's 5 Lessons (Lesson 2 of 5)

## Overview

This video covers the second chapter of Ben Hogan's legendary "Five Lessons" book, focusing on stance and posture fundamentals. Christo Garcia, who rebuilt his swing using Hogan's method, emphasizes that **90% of the shot is taken care of before you ever take the club back**. The core philosophy is to "build the swing into our stance" so that proper execution becomes a matter of "two turns and a swoosh." This lesson covers specific foot positioning, weight distribution, and body connection that formed the foundation of Hogan's precision ball-striking.

## Key Hogan Philosophy

**"We want to build the swing into our stance and if we have everything ready to go all we have to do is two turns in a swoosh and the shot's gonna take care of itself."**

The stance isn't just setup—it's pre-programming the entire swing motion through precise positioning and feel.

## Key Principles

### 1. Stance Determines Success
- Often overlooked by average golfers
- 90% of shot quality comes from proper setup
- If the stance is correct, the swing simplifies dramatically
- Great stance = adherence to address fundamentals

### 2. Weight Distribution is Critical
- Most golfers lose balance by shifting weight forward to toes
- Proper heel-centered weight prevents this common fault
- Enables the club to "orbit around the body" naturally

### 3. Body Connection
- Upper arms connect to chest sides
- Inside muscles of arms and legs engage
- Creates unified, connected turn rather than independent parts

## Step-by-Step Stance Setup

### Foot Position

**Trail Foot (Right foot for right-handers)**
- Position at **90-degree angle to target line**
- Toes pointing straight ahead
- Acts as brace for backswing coil
- Perpendicular positioning prevents overrotation

**Lead Foot (Left foot for right-handers)**
- Toes turned out slightly
- Approximately **1/4 turn open** (about 20-25 degrees)
- Hogan's specific recommendation
- Allows proper hip clearance through impact

### Weight Distribution

**Primary Fundamental: Heels, Not Toes**
- Feel weight **more in the heels** than balls of feet
- **NOT** on your toes
- Weight should feel "deep through your heels"
- This is described as "the second most important thing that's absolutely crucial"

**Why This Matters:**
- Prevents weight swinging forward during the swing
- Common fault: Club swings around body → pulls weight toward toes → loss of balance
- Heel-centered weight puts club "in orbit around our body"
- Maintains balance throughout entire swing

### Body Connection

**Upper Body:**
- Hold upper arms **against the sides of chest**
- Feel connection, not tension
- Creates unified turn

**Lower Body:**
- Feel **inside muscles of legs** engage
- Inside arms and inside legs work together
- Creates stability platform

**Training Aid Tip:**
- Practice with glove or towel under one or both armpits
- Common pro practice method
- Prevents arms separating from body turn

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Weight Too Far Forward
- **Problem**: Weight on balls of feet or toes
- **Result**: Loss of balance as club swings around body
- **Fix**: Consciously feel weight "deep through heels"

### Trail Foot Angled Out
- **Problem**: Trail foot not perpendicular to target line
- **Result**: Allows excessive hip turn in backswing, loss of coil
- **Fix**: Square trail foot at 90 degrees

### Lead Foot Too Closed
- **Problem**: Lead foot pointing straight ahead or closed
- **Result**: Restricts hip turn through impact
- **Fix**: Turn lead foot out approximately 1/4 turn

### Disconnected Arms
- **Problem**: Arms separate from chest, creating independent movement
- **Result**: Inconsistent swing plane, loss of power
- **Fix**: Feel upper arms against chest sides

## Key Checkpoints

Before taking the club back, verify:

1. **Trail foot perpendicular** to target line (90 degrees)
2. **Lead foot open** about 1/4 turn
3. **Weight in heels**, not toes or balls of feet
4. **Upper arms connected** to chest sides
5. **Inside leg muscles** engaged and active
6. **Balance stable** and centered

## Integration with the Swing

### Building Block Approach
- **Lesson 1**: Grip (covered in previous video)
- **Lesson 2**: Stance (this video) - builds on grip
- **Upcoming**: Backswing will build on stance foundation

### Pre-Programming Success
The stance creates:
- **Proper weight distribution** for maintaining balance
- **Foot angles** that allow/restrict turn at right moments
- **Body connection** for unified motion
- **Platform** for "two turns and a swoosh"

### Simplification Through Setup
With perfect stance:
1. Backswing turn (coil against braced trail foot)
2. Downswing turn (release toward open lead foot)
3. Natural swoosh through ball
4. Shot "takes care of itself"

## Practice Recommendations

### Immediate Drills
1. **Foot Angle Check**: Use alignment stick to verify 90-degree trail foot
2. **Weight Test**: Lift toes slightly to feel heel pressure
3. **Connection Drill**: Practice with glove under armpits
4. **Mirror Work**: Check foot angles and posture in mirror

### Feel Development
- Spend time at address feeling weight "deep through heels"
- Notice difference between heel-weight and toe-weight
- Practice maintaining heel pressure through slow-motion swings
- Develop awareness of inside arm/leg muscle engagement

## Key Takeaways

1. **90% of the shot is determined before takeaway** - stance is paramount
2. **Trail foot at 90 degrees** to target line - square to prevent overrotation
3. **Lead foot open 1/4 turn** - allows hip clearance through impact
4. **Weight in heels, not toes** - the most crucial element for balance
5. **Upper arms connect to chest** - creates unified turn
6. **Feel inside muscles of arms and legs** - Hogan's key feeling
7. **Build the swing into the stance** - setup determines swing quality

## Hogan's Core Insight

*"You can take care of most of the golf swing before you ever take the golf club back as long as you have a great stance and adhere to these address fundamentals."*

This philosophy transforms golf from a timing-dependent athletic move to a pre-programmed mechanical sequence. Get the stance right, and the swing becomes dramatically simpler.

## Notes

This video is part of Christo Garcia's instructional series teaching Ben Hogan's method. Garcia rebuilt his entire swing using Hogan's book and became sponsored by Ben Hogan Golf Equipment Company. His teaching emphasizes the transformative power of Hogan's fundamentals when applied systematically.
