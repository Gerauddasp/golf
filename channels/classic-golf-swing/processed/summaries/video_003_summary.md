**Duration**: 3:44
**Part of Series**: Ben Hogan 5 Lessons (Lesson 3 of 5)

## Overview

This video covers the third chapter of Ben Hogan's classic "Five Lessons" book - the backswing. Christo Garcia shares the most transformative concepts he learned from Hogan's backswing fundamentals. The lesson builds on the grip (Lesson 1) and stance (Lesson 2), focusing on three critical elements: bracing the rear leg as a stable post, executing the proper sequence of movement (hands → arms → shoulders → hips), and allowing the hips to open naturally through lead leg flexion. Garcia emphasizes Hogan's famous "pane of glass" concept for maintaining proper swing plane and shares a practical tip from legendary teacher Roger Dunn.

## Key Principles

### Hogan's Backswing Philosophy
- **Consistency Through Structure**: A braced rear leg provides a stable anchor point for repeatable positions
- **Sequential Movement**: The backswing follows a specific chain reaction from small to large body parts
- **Single Plane Concept**: Keep the club under the imaginary pane of glass for more consistent ball striking
- **Natural Hip Rotation**: Allow hips to open (don't restrict them) for a fuller, more powerful turn

## The Three Pillars of Hogan's Backswing

### 1. Brace Your Rear Leg

**Purpose**: Creates a stable post to turn around, ensuring consistent top-of-backswing position

**Key Points**:
- Rear leg acts as the brace for the trail side of your body
- Turn around it like a post
- Prevents leg from moving "all over the place"
- Without a braced leg, you cannot find consistency at the top

**Feel**: Your rear leg should resist the turning motion - stable and firm, not collapsing or swaying

### 2. Hogan's Backswing Sequence

**The "Caddy Drag" Concept**:
Hogan had slight flexibility in his wrists that created a small initial hand movement

**Proper Order of Movement**:
1. **Hands start first** - slight wrist hinge/flex
2. **Arms follow** - arms begin moving back
3. **Shoulders turn** - upper body rotation engages
4. **Hips turn last** - lower body follows upper body

**Critical Understanding**: This is a chain reaction, not simultaneous movement. Each part triggers the next.

### 3. The Famous "Pane of Glass"

**Hogan's Visualization**:
- Imagine a pane of glass running from the golf ball up across your shoulders
- The club should stay underneath this imaginary plane throughout the backswing
- DO NOT break through the glass by reaching up high

**Why It Matters**:
- Keeps the club on a single plane (more consistent)
- Prevents moving to a secondary plane over the shoulders (inconsistent)
- Ensures the club is in position to deliver properly on the downswing

**Practical Tip from Roger Dunn**:
*"Take your lead hand and reach in the pocket of your opposite hip"*
- This simple thought keeps the club under the plane
- Garcia credits this tip with solving his plane issues
- Easy to remember and execute on the course

## Hip Action and Lead Leg Movement

### Allow Hips to Open

**Hogan's Instruction**:
- DO allow your hips to open on the backswing
- DON'T restrict hip turn trying to create "coil"

**Benefits**:
- Creates a longer swing
- Gives more time to execute proper delivery
- Generates more power naturally
- Improves consistency

### Lead Leg Breaking In

**Correct Movement**:
- Lead leg knee breaks IN towards the rear leg
- NOT poking out toward the ball
- This allows the foot to roll to the instep

**Heel Lift**:
- Hogan wasn't concerned with lifting the heel high
- Let the foot roll in naturally
- The heel lift is a RESULT of the inward roll, not a goal itself

**Feel**: The lead knee moves toward your back leg, weight rolls to the inside of your lead foot, heel may lift naturally

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rear Leg Collapse**: Letting the rear leg sway or lose its brace
   - Fix: Feel like you're turning around a post

2. **Simultaneous Movement**: Moving everything at once
   - Fix: Feel the sequence: hands → arms → shoulders → hips

3. **Breaking the Plane**: Lifting the club too vertical/steep
   - Fix: Feel like your lead hand is reaching into your opposite hip pocket

4. **Blocking Hip Turn**: Restricting hip rotation for "coil"
   - Fix: Allow hips to turn freely - let the lead knee move toward the rear leg

5. **Forcing Heel Lift**: Actively lifting the lead heel high
   - Fix: Let the foot roll to the instep; heel lift happens naturally

## Key Checkpoints

### Rear Leg (Throughout):
- ✓ Stable and braced
- ✓ Acting as a post to turn around
- ✗ Not swaying or collapsing

### Sequence (Takeaway to Top):
- ✓ Hands initiate movement
- ✓ Arms follow hands
- ✓ Shoulders follow arms
- ✓ Hips follow shoulders

### Club Path (Entire Backswing):
- ✓ Stays under the imaginary pane of glass
- ✓ On a single plane
- ✗ Not reaching high and steep

### Lead Hand (Mid-Backswing):
- ✓ Feels like reaching into opposite hip pocket
- ✓ Keeps club under the plane

### Hips (Backswing):
- ✓ Allowed to open/turn
- ✓ Creates full, natural rotation

### Lead Leg (Backswing):
- ✓ Knee breaks IN toward rear leg
- ✓ Foot rolls to instep
- ✓ Heel may lift naturally
- ✗ Knee not poking out toward ball

## Integration with Previous Lessons

### Building on Lesson 1 (Grip):
- Proper grip allows the hands to work correctly in the backswing sequence
- Wrist flexibility for the "caddy drag" depends on correct grip pressure

### Building on Lesson 2 (Stance):
- Proper stance width and rear leg flex sets up the braced rear leg
- Weight distribution at address affects ability to maintain the brace

### Setting Up Lesson 4 (Downswing):
- The braced rear leg becomes the launching pad for the downswing
- Proper backswing plane ensures proper downswing plane
- Hip opening on backswing sets up hip clearing on downswing

## Practice Progression

### Step 1: Establish the Brace
**Drill**: Make half swings feeling your rear leg as a solid post
- Focus solely on maintaining rear leg stability
- Don't worry about anything else initially

### Step 2: Learn the Sequence
**Drill**: Ultra-slow backswings with pause between each step
- Hands start → pause
- Arms follow → pause
- Shoulders turn → pause
- Hips turn → pause
- Feel each part initiating the next

### Step 3: Master the Plane
**Drill**: Use the "opposite hip pocket" feel
- On every backswing, feel your lead hand reaching into opposite hip pocket
- Check in a mirror or on video to verify club stays under the plane

### Step 4: Free the Hips
**Drill**: Exaggerate hip turn with lead knee moving IN
- Allow full hip rotation
- Feel lead foot roll to instep
- Let heel lift naturally

### Step 5: Put It All Together
**Drill**: Full swings with one thought at a time
- Round 1: "Brace rear leg"
- Round 2: "Hands start first"
- Round 3: "Lead hand to hip pocket"
- Round 4: "Let hips open"

## Key Takeaways

1. **Rear leg must be braced throughout the backswing** - it's your stable post for consistency
2. **Backswing follows a specific sequence**: hands → arms → shoulders → hips (not all at once)
3. **Keep club under the "pane of glass"** - use the feel of lead hand reaching to opposite hip pocket
4. **Allow hips to open freely** - let lead knee break IN toward rear leg, foot rolls to instep
5. **Natural heel lift is fine** - it's a result of proper movement, not a goal itself
6. **Single plane is more consistent** than multiple planes - stay under the glass

## Hogan's Timeless Wisdom

*"The rear leg is the brace for the trail side of my body as I turn around it like a post."*

*"He didn't want to break that pane of glass - he wanted to keep the club underneath it."*

*"Allow your hips to open on the backswing - this is going to allow you to have a longer swing and give you more time to execute a great delivery."*

## Historical Context

Ben Hogan's "Five Lessons: The Modern Fundamentals of Golf" (1957) is considered one of the most influential golf instruction books ever written. This backswing chapter is where Hogan's famous pane of glass concept was introduced, revolutionizing how players thought about swing plane. Christo Garcia's interpretation makes these classic fundamentals accessible to modern golfers while maintaining Hogan's precision and attention to mechanical detail.
