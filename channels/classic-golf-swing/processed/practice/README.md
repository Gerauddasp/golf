# Hogan Practice System

This folder contains practice resources for implementing Ben Hogan's Five Lessons methodology.

## System Overview

Hogan's approach is **sequential and systematic**: master each fundamental before moving to the next. This is NOT a quick-fix system—it's a foundation for long-term improvement.

## Practice Philosophy

> "I didn't get really good until I stopped trying to do many things perfectly and instead focused on executing a few simple principles very well." - Ben Hogan

**Core Principles:**
- Master fundamentals sequentially (don't skip ahead)
- Focus on ONE element at a time
- Quality practice > quantity practice
- Feel-based learning through awareness
- Patience with the process

## Practice Files

### 📋 practice_progression.md
Week-by-week practice plan for mastering all 5 lessons systematically

### 🎯 drill_library.md
Specific drills for each fundamental (grip, stance, backswing, downswing)

### 📊 progress_tracker.md
Templates for tracking your progress through each lesson

## How to Use This System

### Phase 1: Assessment (Week 0)
1. Read all 5 video summaries
2. Read master_summary.md
3. Film your current swing
4. Identify your biggest weakness

### Phase 2: Sequential Learning (Weeks 1-8)
1. Start with Lesson 1 (Grip) regardless of current skill level
2. Spend 1-2 weeks per lesson
3. Don't move forward until current lesson feels natural
4. Use drills from drill_library.md
5. Track progress in progress_tracker.md

### Phase 3: Integration (Weeks 9+)
1. Practice full swings with one thought at a time
2. Rotate focus between the 4 fundamentals
3. Film regularly to verify positions
4. Use quick_reference.md for reminders

## Practice Schedule Options

### Intensive Practice (5-7 days/week)
- **Days 1-3**: Current lesson drills (30 min each)
- **Day 4**: Review previous lessons (30 min)
- **Day 5**: Full integration practice (45 min)
- **Days 6-7**: Rest or light review (15 min)

### Moderate Practice (3-4 days/week)
- **Day 1**: Current lesson drills (45 min)
- **Day 2**: Review + integration (45 min)
- **Day 3**: Full swing practice with current focus (45 min)
- **Day 4**: Rest

### Light Practice (1-2 days/week)
- **Day 1**: Current lesson + previous lesson review (60 min)
- **Day 2**: Full integration practice (60 min)

## Key Success Factors

### 1. Don't Rush
- Each lesson typically takes 1-2 weeks to feel natural
- Some golfers need longer—that's fine
- Better to master each piece than rush through

### 2. Use Feedback
- Mirror work for grip and stance
- Video for backswing plane and sequence
- Impact spray for contact quality
- Balanced finish for downswing sequence

### 3. One Thought at a Time
- During full swings, focus on ONE element
- Rotate focus: grip one day, stance next, etc.
- Let other elements run on autopilot

### 4. Feel Before Ball
- Master the FEEL of each position
- Practice without ball first
- Add ball only when motion feels natural

## Progress Indicators

### Grip (Lesson 1)
✓ Can set grip consistently without thinking
✓ Swing wreckers stay passive naturally
✓ Wrist arch present automatically

### Stance (Lesson 2)
✓ Weight stays in heels throughout swing
✓ Foot angles feel natural
✓ Arms stay connected to chest instinctively

### Backswing (Lesson 3)
✓ Rear leg braces automatically
✓ Club stays on plane without effort
✓ Sequence feels smooth and natural

### Downswing (Lesson 4)
✓ Hips initiate instinctively
✓ Weight transfers smoothly
✓ Can hold balanced finish consistently

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Skipping Ahead
- "I already know the grip, let me jump to backswing"
- **Problem**: Slight grip issues compound into major swing issues
- **Solution**: Trust the process, start with Lesson 1

### ❌ Too Many Thoughts
- Trying to think about grip + stance + plane + hips simultaneously
- **Problem**: Paralysis by analysis
- **Solution**: ONE thought per swing

### ❌ Rushing Timeline
- Trying to master all 4 lessons in 1 week
- **Problem**: Nothing sticks, revert to old habits
- **Solution**: Minimum 1-2 weeks per lesson

### ❌ Practicing Without Awareness
- Mindlessly hitting balls without feeling fundamentals
- **Problem**: Reinforcing old patterns, not building new ones
- **Solution**: Every swing with PURPOSE and FEEL

## Getting Started

1. **Read** master_summary.md fully
2. **Watch** or review Video 1 summary (Grip)
3. **Start** with Week 1 in practice_progression.md
4. **Use** drill_library.md for specific exercises
5. **Track** progress in progress_tracker.md
6. **Be patient** - this is a marathon, not a sprint

## Questions to Ask Yourself

**After Each Practice Session:**
- What fundamental did I focus on today?
- Can I feel the difference from my old habit?
- What felt natural? What felt awkward?
- Am I ready to move forward, or do I need another session on this?

**Each Week:**
- Has this fundamental become automatic?
- Do I need to think about it, or does it just happen?
- Can I execute it under pressure (on course)?
- Time to move to next lesson, or reinforce current one?

## Expectations

### Week 1-2 (Grip)
- Feels weird at first (if you're changing it)
- By end of week 2: Starts to feel more natural
- Don't move forward until grip is consistent

### Week 3-4 (Stance)
- Weight in heels feels strange initially
- Connection drill (towel under arms) helps awareness
- By end of week 4: Setup should feel athletic and balanced

### Week 5-6 (Backswing)
- Bracing rear leg feels restrictive at first
- Staying under plane feels shorter initially
- By end of week 6: Backswing feels controlled and powerful

### Week 7-8 (Downswing)
- Hips-first feel awkward (hands want to start)
- Weight transfer takes conscious effort
- By end of week 8: Sequence starts to flow naturally

### Week 9+ (Integration)
- Still need conscious focus on one element at a time
- Gradually becomes more automatic over months
- Full integration: 3-6 months of consistent practice

## The Bottom Line

This is **Ben Hogan's proven method** for building a fundamentally sound golf swing. It worked for him (one of the greatest ball-strikers in history), it worked for Christo Garcia (rebuilt his entire swing with this system), and it can work for you.

**The catch**: You must trust the process, be patient, and practice with purpose.

**The reward**: A swing built on solid fundamentals that will serve you for the rest of your golfing life.
