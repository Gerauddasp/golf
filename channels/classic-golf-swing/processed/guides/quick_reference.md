## The 4 Building Blocks

### 1️⃣ GRIP

**Lead Hand** (Left for righties):
- ✓ Club in crook of first finger
- ✓ Runs across PALM (not fingers)
- ✓ Slight wrist arch (straight line to forearm)

**Trail Hand** (Right for righties):
- ✓ Club in FINGERS (not palm)
- ✓ Focus on middle two fingers ("Bruce Lee fingers")
- ✓ Pressure point under knuckle
- ⚠️ **Swing Wreckers**: Keep outer two fingers passive!

### 2️⃣ STANCE

**Foot Position:**
- ✓ Trail foot: **90° to target** (perpendicular)
- ✓ Lead foot: **Open 1/4 turn** (~20-25°)

**Weight:**
- ✓ Feel weight **IN HEELS** (not toes!)
- ✓ "Deep through your heels"

**Connection:**
- ✓ Upper arms to chest sides
- ✓ Inside leg muscles engaged

> "90% of the shot is in the setup"

### 3️⃣ BACKSWING

**The Sequence:**
1. Hands start
2. Arms follow
3. Shoulders turn
4. Hips turn last

**Key Feels:**
- ✓ **Rear leg BRACED** (stable post)
- ✓ **Stay under "pane of glass"** (don't lift steep)
- ✓ **Lead hand to opposite hip pocket** (stays on plane)
- ✓ **Allow hips to OPEN** (don't restrict)
- ✓ **Lead knee breaks IN** (toward rear leg)

### 4️⃣ DOWNSWING

**The Trigger:**
- ✓ **HIPS initiate** (not hands!)
- ✓ "The swing is down below" - Hogan

**The Sequence:**
1. **Lateral shift** to lead foot (weight transfer)
2. **Hips rotate/clear** (create space)
3. **Shoulders pulled** through
4. **Arms pulled** through
5. **Club delivered**

**Visualization**: Elastic band on lead hip "snaps back"

**Finish:**
- ✓ **Balanced** (hold for 3+ seconds)
- ✓ Weight completely on lead side

## Pre-Shot Checklist

### Setup (5 seconds)
- [ ] Grip: Palm/fingers, middle two fingers, swing wreckers passive
- [ ] Stance: Trail 90°, lead open, weight in heels
- [ ] Connection: Arms to chest

### Swing Thoughts (Pick ONE)
- **"Middle two fingers"** (grip focus)
- **"Weight in heels"** (balance focus)
- **"Rear leg brace"** (backswing focus)
- **"Lead hand to hip pocket"** (plane focus)
- **"Hips first"** (downswing focus)
- **"Elastic snaps back"** (transition focus)

### After Shot
- [ ] Could I hold my finish for 3 seconds?
- [ ] If yes → good sequence
- [ ] If no → check sequence (usually started with hands)

## Common Faults & Quick Fixes

| Problem | Likely Cause | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| **Slicing** | Grip too weak, swing wreckers active | Check grip: club across palm, middle two fingers |
| **Hooking** | Swing wreckers over-involved | Passive outer fingers, focus middle two |
| **Fat shots** | No weight transfer | Feel weight shift to lead foot before rotating |
| **Thin shots** | Weight staying back | Lateral shift first, hips lead |
| **Over-the-top** | Starting with hands | Hips initiate, upper body follows |
| **Steep swing** | Breaking plane | Lead hand to opposite hip pocket feel |
| **Loss of balance** | Weight on toes | Feel weight deep in heels at setup |
| **Inconsistent contact** | Poor sequence | Hands → Arms → Shoulders → Hips (back), Hips → Shoulders → Arms → Club (down) |

## The One-Minute Pre-Practice Routine

1. **Grip Check** (20 sec)
   - Lead: crook of finger, palm, arch
   - Trail: middle two fingers, passive wreckers

2. **Stance Check** (20 sec)
   - Feet: trail 90°, lead open
   - Weight: heels, not toes
   - Connection: arms to chest

3. **Sequence Reminder** (20 sec)
   - Back: Hands → Arms → Shoulders → Hips
   - Down: Hips (shift + clear) → Shoulders → Arms → Club
   - Finish: BALANCED

## Hogan's Core Principles (Never Forget)

1. **Simplicity**: Execute a few things very well, not many things poorly
2. **Sequence**: Right order = effortless power
3. **Ground Up**: Downswing starts with legs/hips, not hands
4. **Fundamentals**: They determine your ceiling
5. **Balance**: If you can hold finish, swing was probably good
6. **Feel**: Know where weight is, where club is

## When You're Struggling

**Ask yourself:**

1. **Grip** - Are swing wreckers active? Club across palm?
2. **Setup** - Is weight in heels? Trail foot square?
3. **Backswing** - Is rear leg braced? Am I breaking the plane?
4. **Downswing** - Did hands start first instead of hips?

**Most common issue**: Starting downswing with hands instead of hips.

**Quick reset**: Do 5 reps of belt grab drill.

## Practice Priorities

**Week 1-2**: Grip only (no balls)
**Week 3-4**: Add stance, half swings
**Week 5-6**: Add backswing sequence, 3/4 swings
**Week 7-8**: Add downswing, full swings
**Week 9+**: One thought at a time, integrated practice

**Remember**: Master each piece before adding the next.
