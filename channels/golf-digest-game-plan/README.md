## Key Strategy Rules Extracted

### Driver (65-Yard Rule)
- **60m+ between hazards** = Hit driver (stock shot)
- **Narrow fairway (<50m)** = Lower tee height for control
- **90% power** = Consistency beats distance (pros live at 95%)
- **Bullet vs Bomb** = Low tee (control) vs High tee (distance)

### Putting (10% Zone)
- **10% rule**: Target a circle 10% of putt distance (10m putt = 1m zone)
- **Go high and soft**: Over-reading misses by 50%, under-reading misses by 300%
- **77%** of best putters' putts from outside 8m stay within 10% zone

### Wedges (Safe Corridor)
- **North-south problem**: Distance misses 2x larger than direction misses
- **12ft buffer**: Aim 4m right of left pins, left of right pins
- **Low flight, high spin**: Launch at 50% of club loft
- **Clock system**: Change backswing length, not swing speed

### Par 5 (Traffic Light System)
- **Green light** (clear path) = Always go for it
- **Yellow light** (can't reach) = Chase it down as far as possible
- **Red light** (hazards/trees) = 9/10 rule - pick shot you'd make 9/10 times

### Recovery (No Two Bad Shots)
- **One bad shot OK, two kills your score**
- **Zigzag recovery**: One zig out, one zag back to good position
- **100-yard pitch out** = Exactly one shot's worth of distance

### Approach (Aim for Misses)
- **Ice cream cone**: Visualize your entire dispersion pattern
- **Aim at middle of green**: Takes water balls out of play
- **Trouble front = aim long**: Play average of pin and back edge
- **Trouble back = aim short**: Use runways designed for run-up
