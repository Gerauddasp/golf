This is Danny. Danny's a 10 handicapper and he's struggling with his driving. He's leaving the golf ball out to the right. So, we work at two drills and the second one is guaranteed virtually every time to help you if you're losing the golf ball out to the right. But if we have a look at this here, you say that your body's stalling when you're hitting it.

>> The body is stalling. It's not really working as hard as we would like.

>> The reason it wants to stall is because the face is open. When the club shaft is at parallel to the ground, look at the club face there.

>> Mhm. It's just laid back. So that suggests it's open on that shot that peels out to the right.

>> This would be the club face being open at this stage here. So the leading edge pointing back up behind us, which is where yours is. I'm just going to rotate really hard and get the club moving to the ball. Look at the face.

>> For the most part, it's going to be left open.

>> So what you have to do from here is you have to kind of stall here and allow that kind of motion. Correct.

>> This is what's allowing you to square the face up.

>> Yep. So, what I'd like to see from that club face at this stage is that at least we can get it to here. So, it's more toe straight up in the air.

>> In an ideal world, I'd like that leading edge look like that.

>> That would be a better place for us to be. What we would like to see is as you are shifting toward the target, so as you shift,

>> the arms are sort of dropping into here. And by the time this kind of club shaft is parallel to the ground, the club will look a little bit more like this.

>> This is the crazy part. The difference between that

>> and that is definitely further

>> and it's definitely straighter.

>> Okay.

>> But what I'd like to do is set up to the ball and I want you to swing to the top of your back swing and stop. Now swing down to that waist high place and just get the club face in a good position. Beautiful. That would be beautiful. Okay.

>> Now put it into an open place. Show me the bad one. Good. And even your open one isn't as bad as as what it was is when you hit a shot. Yes. It just gets a little bit more when you hit a shot. You understanding the feel of knowing what it feels like to be bad and feels like to be good is really important.

>> Okay.

>> Okay. Good. You've got the feel. Yeah.

>> Yep.

>> Let's have a go hitting a shot and see what happens. So, same feel as that.

>> Okay. That would make total sense, wouldn't it?

>> Yeah.

>> Imagine it was if you were a computer program.

>> Mhm.

>> If we could suddenly have that change in your game.

>> Yep.

>> Which would then make every single shot go left. We'd then have to take stock and go, well, have we done it too much?

>> Right. Or now do we just need to put the body in? This is why I love you working in a net at home and just working at the positions and then your body will figure out how to move. Club path on that one was 0.0. So you're so good at that. The face was 3° closed.

>> Okay,

>> that's beautiful. Let's just do that again.

That's beautiful. Very nice.

Very good. when we see you come down and it looks pretty good through this area here. It's through here

>> that you're kind of getting this move here. So, this wrist is cupping out

>> and that face is just getting open. I want to get that club

>> getting it closed down here. And let's see if we can get that ball going a little bit to the left. Yeah.

>> Okay.

>> Beautiful. That's good. That's good. That's good. And then when you hit this one,

>> just make sure you really kind of exaggerate that feeling. Okay.

>> If he goes left, he goes left.

I think I'm still open though when I'm hitting it.

>> Yeah. Again, look at your club path. 0.3.

>> Uhhuh.

>> And the face is 2.1 closed. But you could have had the club face better there.

>> Mhm.

>> But that still doesn't mean that you're going to represent it good there. You still could get it here and still work a little bit that way as you're swinging through cuz your club path numbers are money every single time.

>> Yeah.

>> But that face is still getting too open.

>> Yeah. He's definitely getting the club face better at this stage here when the club shaft is parallel to the ground. Now for Danny, we need to add in more face closure. We need to exaggerate it more to get him to this point when we can understand what hitting it left actually feels like. We're going secret weapon.

>> We're going nuclear.

>> We're going nuclear. We're going nuclear on you. I like it. I've never called it nuclear before. Let's combine the drill we've got already

>> and the secret weapon.

>> Okay.

>> Your first one will be a hook and then your second one will be the best drive of it today.

>> Okay, here we go.

>> That's a bold statement, isn't it? That's pretty seaming.

>> So, getting it here. Brilliant. But now, what I need you to do is to continue the closing of the face. And we're going to get the toe to hit the bag first. We're going to get the toe to hit the bag first.

>> So, this is just us really understanding what it's like to really shut the face down. And we're going to hook it.

>> So, down to waist high. Club face is strong. And then from there, toe in the bag. Beautiful. So, swing it down to waist high. Club face check. Beautiful. Good. Let's see you hit a big hook.

>> There's the big hook.

>> Okay.

>> Jesus.

I mean, it's like

>> so good.

>> Really good.

>> Yeah.

>> Again, look at the numbers there. Okay. 1.2 club path to the right, one degree left of it.

>> Phenomenal difference. So, if you're still leaving the ball out to the right,

>> you do it exactly this way. So, swing to the top and stop. Swing down to waist high on the way down with the club face strong. And now put the toe in the bag.

>> Beautiful. Now you're not hitting it to the right. You're hitting it pretty square, pretty straight

>> like that. The good shot we just hit,

>> but you want to continue and maintain that. Well, let's do this. Set up to the bag. So this is if you want to maintain straight.

>> So swing to the top. Swing it down to three. And now hit the bag with a square face.

>> Beautiful.

>> So you're still squaring the face up. You're not leaving it open. Hitting it with a square face. Yeah, we're not ready yet to go to square face. We want to make sure the toe is doing it.

>> Beautiful. Move the bag out the way.

>> Beautiful.

>> So good.

So good. So, what's starting to happen now, without getting too technical, swing back. The club face is getting stronger here.

>> Okay. Your body is aware now that the face is getting stronger and it's aware that you're squaring the face up more through here. So now, if anything, the path is naturally starting to shift a bit more to the right. So 2.8° to the right on that one.

>> Okay?

>> And the face is 1.9 left of it. So it's beautiful draw. Let's say that you got to a point when you were here, which is miles underneath the plane. How do you get the club back on plane from there? What do we have to do?

>> Turn. So if you can turn your body, look what happens to the club head. Just watch the club head for me. It's going to be thrown back out to the golf ball.

>> Does that make sense? Mhm.

>> So if the club does start to get here more, which it naturally could do, and you will see from the video we took, it's like the face is stronger and the club head is a little bit more behind the hands.

>> From here, you've naturally now with time, you'll rotate your body to throw the club head back out onto the plane.

>> Mhm.

>> To hit straighter shots.

>> So at the moment, the play is going to be

>> you'd hit the odd one left, but you hit some big rights.

>> Yeah.

>> The key is get rid of the rights. probably make it more left biased

>> by getting the club face better and the club path will stay relatively similar but maybe a little bit more rightward.

>> But then the way that we're going to get you getting straighter now with time will be to get the body to work a little bit better.

>> Beautiful.

>> And then this one hopefully will be a ripper.

>> It is crazy how that works, isn't it? Right. Let's show you this. This is the old swing. This is you bringing the club down and leaving the face open.

>> Mhm.

>> This is the swing after hitting the bag. We can see now that the club, it's a little bit more behind the hands now. So, it's a little bit more draw biased.

>> Now, we could still work on that club being a little bit more closed.

>> But if you just look at those two there, we're talking about a 3 to 5° angle difference, but that's all we're going to need in order to hit some some powerful drives and some straighter drives and some less drives to the right. And ultimately the golf ball is going a lot less to the right now on a consistent basis.

>> With time your body will adapt to this new club face and it will be even better for you.

>> Appreciate it.
