[0.24s] So Michelle was actually taking the club

[2.16s] back really slow and controlled. And

[5.76s] what this was doing for her was it was

[7.68s] allowing her to hit fairways, but it was

[9.92s] actually robbing her of a load of speed,

[11.76s] a load of potential speed. So in the

[14.00s] lesson, we actually got her swinging the

[15.60s] club head 10 mph faster. And in this

[18.72s] video, I'm going to show you how we did

[20.72s] that.

[22.96s] I mean,

[25.36s] they're so good. And it was all about

[27.20s] breaking down a few beliefs as the first

[29.36s] thing because often times we think when

[32.48s] we swing faster and longer, we can lose

[34.88s] control. Um, a lot of the time swinging

[37.52s] faster and longer is actually going to

[39.20s] help you get more control, but

[41.20s] definitely it's going to help you get

[42.24s] more speed. I'm I'm going to hit one and

[45.12s] we'll show Michelle swinging here as

[46.72s] well. I'm going to show you what this

[48.08s] kind of looks like. So, it was kind of

[49.60s] like her mind was going, I've got to hit

[52.08s] the fairway. It's much it's very

[54.00s] beneficial for me to hit the fairway. Of

[55.60s] course, we know that, but it was slow.

[57.52s] It was controlled and she was doing it.

[60.00s] So, we've got full swing in speed in

[61.60s] play here. I'm going to have a slow,

[63.20s] controlled back swing, but then I'm

[64.32s] going to do my normal down swing. So,

[66.64s] slow and controlled.

[69.44s] Okay. And I put a bit of speed into that

[71.92s] one. It felt one thing for me when I do

[74.88s] a shot like that, it feels like I'm

[76.80s] having to put a lot of effort into the

[78.24s] down swing. I'm slow and controlled and

[80.56s] I'm putting a lot of effort in. That was

[82.40s] 104 mph club head speed. So 104 mph club

[86.00s] head speed. We would look at that there

[87.84s] and go okay for me we know that's going

[89.84s] to be lower. I'm going to be hopefully

[91.44s] around about 115 depending on the day.

[94.96s] But for Michelle she was sort of looking

[96.64s] at 71 72 mph. So here's the first thing

[100.96s] that we did. The first thing that we did

[104.00s] was we needed to create more energy in

[106.00s] the back swing. We needed to actually

[108.08s] create more speed in the back swing. If

[109.92s] we look at the longest hitters in the

[111.44s] world, got a great video I use a lot

[113.28s] with Martin Borgmire. When he's taking

[116.00s] the club back, the shaft is bending

[118.40s] ridiculously. He's putting that much

[120.40s] force and impulse into the handle of the

[123.44s] club as he's moving the club back that

[125.52s] he bends the shaft significantly. So,

[128.48s] what we did with Michelle was we wanted

[130.56s] to create a little bit of that bend. So,

[132.32s] what I did, I stood in the way and then

[134.72s] from there I got Michelle to take the

[136.24s] club back. Now, she couldn't move the

[137.68s] club because obviously I was standing in

[139.04s] the way. But as she was doing this, I

[140.96s] was asking her, "What are you feeling?

[142.72s] Where are you feeling this in your

[144.08s] body?" And she went, "Well, obviously I

[146.56s] can feel it in my hands, but I'm really

[148.00s] feeling it everywhere." She was feeling

[150.08s] it in her core, in her legs, her hips,

[152.72s] her feet even. And she was aware and

[154.96s] mindful that she was trying to move the

[157.52s] club back, but obviously wasn't being

[159.36s] able to move it. But her whole body was

[160.88s] being stressed and used as a result of

[163.12s] this. And I often say to people, imagine

[165.76s] you've got a um a sledgehammer. You've

[168.16s] got a sledgehammer here in front of you.

[170.00s] How are you going to move that back? You

[172.24s] can't just do that with your hands and

[173.76s] your arms. Your whole body is going to

[175.76s] be moving like this to create some some

[179.04s] strength and some movement, some power,

[180.72s] some speed, everything that we need.

[183.28s] So once we got Michelle used to actually

[186.96s] feeling what it's like to move her body

[188.96s] and feel her body obviously doing a lot

[191.04s] of work without the club moving, I then

[193.20s] stood out the way and I just said to

[194.56s] her, "Look, I want you to have some

[195.92s] practice back swings where you just do

[197.60s] this." It is literally that you're

[200.48s] trying to fling the club back. And

[203.36s] straight away her approach was to not

[206.16s] kind of do this move here and position

[208.24s] everything. It was literally move the

[210.56s] club back really fast. Now, you might be

[212.80s] watching this and going, "Well, hang on

[214.00s] a bit. Is this going to make me a better

[215.68s] golfer?" Well, I'm keep watching the

[217.28s] video because I'm going to let you know

[218.32s] exactly how this will portray for you.

[221.04s] But ultimately, we were just trying to

[223.20s] train speed, get more speed. Rolo's

[225.92s] getting in on the action here. So, once

[228.56s] we got her getting used to getting the

[230.72s] club moving back faster, the speed

[233.28s] started to jump up. So, I hit one at 104

[235.36s] there. Let me hit one now. And in this

[237.12s] one, all I'm thinking is speed in the

[239.28s] back swing. Impulse. Use the body to

[242.24s] move the club up there quickly. So, we

[244.80s] should get a jump up in speed. Don't

[246.88s] forget the last one was slow and

[248.16s] controlled. I did still try and hit it

[250.00s] hard on the way down. This is just going

[252.48s] all out hard.

[256.88s] Okay. And also, when you're doing this,

[258.88s] make sure you know what the shots like.

[260.80s] That was actually a good drive, but it

[262.80s] was a little bit out the toe, so I

[264.00s] definitely would have lost ball speed.

[265.04s] So, 110 mph straight away. For me, the

[268.64s] only way that you're going to know this

[270.40s] is a true test for you is when you are

[273.28s] hitting shots and you're slow,

[275.76s] controlled, and putting effort in versus

[278.24s] fast, aggressive, and putting effort in.

[280.48s] You're then you're then going to know

[281.84s] which one is going to be best for you,

[283.36s] and hopefully you can see a speed jump

[285.04s] up. If you haven't got a launch monitor,

[287.12s] hopefully you can just see it on the

[288.24s] fairway. So once we got Michelle used to

[292.40s] moving the club faster here, the next

[294.56s] thing we did was we wanted to create

[296.08s] more length in the back swing. So

[298.32s] Michelle's back swing was quite short.

[299.92s] And if you think about it, if you go

[301.28s] slow and controlled, you're probably

[302.64s] going to be a little bit shorter. If we

[304.72s] put more speed into the back swing, it's

[306.56s] easier to create that longer back swing.

[308.72s] So her job was to literally from there

[311.12s] was to go right, I'm going to create

[313.12s] speed and energy to start with using the

[315.92s] body and then I'm just going to allow

[317.68s] the arms to go further. So she almost

[319.84s] got to the point in her practice swings

[321.12s] where she could see the club out the

[322.56s] corner of her eye. So she was overswing

[324.64s] a little bit. Now that's fine if we

[327.04s] consider she was swinging here. Her

[329.12s] practicing an overswing, the reality is

[330.96s] it will probably be here. And don't

[332.56s] forget, we're talking driver only here.

[334.56s] a slight overswing the driver. I've got

[336.56s] no problem as long as you have got that

[338.32s] control. So once we got a getting

[340.88s] comfortable that you got it, we got a

[342.48s] hitting a shot. So I was 110 on the last

[344.40s] one. Let's get a fast back swing with a

[346.72s] longer back swing and we'll see whether

[348.64s] it can work and get even more speed. I'd

[351.20s] like to get around about 112 with what

[352.96s] I'll be looking for.

[356.64s] Okay, so pulled it a little bit. Still a

[359.84s] functional golf shot. Okay, that was

[361.60s] interesting. That was 116. So obviously

[364.32s] that just shows you how short I was

[367.84s] probably swinging. I feel a little bit

[368.96s] tight. So it just shows you how short I

[370.56s] was swinging. So straight away think of

[372.56s] this. If the club goes further in the

[375.36s] back swing, it's like chipping. It's

[377.44s] like putting. It's going to go further.

[379.76s] If we think about John Ram, Tony Fen now

[383.04s] short goal swings. They have hit shots

[385.28s] with longer back swings and they've hit

[387.44s] the ball a lot further. So the key for

[389.84s] you on this is how does this relate to

[392.40s] you? What I would suggest is next time

[394.24s] you go and practice, if you're hitting

[396.48s] 20 drives, make the last 10 high-speed

[400.16s] back swings. So, if you feel that you're

[401.92s] a little bit short and controlled in

[403.68s] that back swing, get on the range and

[405.76s] have these fast moveways. Practice that

[409.12s] and then go long, but make sure you're

[411.52s] warmed up because we're going to be

[412.80s] using the body a lot. And then hit 10

[414.96s] shots and take stock. So, if you're like

[417.20s] Michelle, when she hit those 10 shots

[420.32s] with her new with her new back swing,

[422.56s] she was just as accurate. So, the key

[424.32s] for you is just try this for yourself.

[426.00s] Experiment and just let us know in the

[427.68s] comments how it goes for you. And if you
