My brother has a simulator in his house. I will hit the ceiling if I'm hitting driver. >> Well, that was Nate. And in today's live lesson, we didn't mess around with his setup or his back swing. We actually worked through impact and into his finish. And the results were unbelievable. >> Oh my gosh. >> You've got to check this out. All right. So, the two lines I've got in, I've got a yellow line on the backside, and I've got a red swing plane line in place. Now, the yellow line, the reason I've got that in there is because the setup is quite bent forward. I want to see how much that can change during your golf swing as a result of being bent forward. And obviously, we've got the plane line there to see what your club is doing. So, on the way back, we can see it's beautifully on it to start with, raises slightly above it, so it's more of a two plane swing. Absolutely fine. Then as you swing down, you'll notice that you come away from the yellow line and the club head gets behind your hands now and also underneath the plane. And if we think about this here as it continues down into impact, this is the reason why we're seeing club path numbers and they're averaging like four and five degrees out to the right. So the club path is very much out to the right. This is why we can hook the golf ball. And the club head spends a long time or it doesn't exactly do this, but it it appears to be traveling really out on the way through as far as going down the target line. So my first question to you in the moment is going to be, you know, this club is extending so much down the target line. Is that a conscious thought for you? Has that ever been a conscious thought for you? >> Never. No. Never thought about it. >> So basically what we're seeing is imagine obviously we've got our target line here. So, what we're seeing is that when you swing down, the club head gets behind the hands, which means you're under the plane. You then approach the ball like this, giving us a club path number of 5 degrees, right? But then from there, as you swing through, this club really does extend and disconnect from the body, which is fine for power and speed, but it really is traveling out to the right, gets high here. You know, I can think of driving ranges in the UK where we used to coach, Andy. You'd be hitting the ceiling and you're not super tall, but your arms are really extended and really high. So, but that's never been a conscious thought for you. >> No. No. But my brother has a simulator in his house. I will hit the ceiling if I'm hitting driver for that. Probably for that reason. Yeah. >> Practice a lot in his house >> and with his driver. >> What I'm seeing with you, Nate, is that you hit the ball really well. Three handicapper. Drive it nicely. You want to be better. Yeah. >> And you want to understand why it's hooking. I mean, how many hooks out of 14 drives? How many would you hook to the left? >> Two, three. >> Maybe. >> I mean, you're at a point really where we've got to be going, you know, maybe you're being a little harsh on yourself almost and going, if I think I said to you off camera, if you were a mini tour player or a tour player and you said, I want to keep this swing in this shape, I'd say, great. We'll just show you how to manage it. >> Yeah. >> And not necessarily have to change too much. But I do want to show you what is possible um as we go through this. So in my mind when I look at your goal swing, I could do some work in the setup potentially. You mentioned already that there's a little bit of sway. Yes, I think you're working at that and you've managed that. >> Okay, we'll just leave that alone. There's definitely something at the top of your back swing with your arms that we could look at. >> But I'm going to go all the way to what we've just been speaking about, which is can we get the club to go less out through that hitting area. So, what we're going to do here is if we imagine this, when you saw the plane before, we kind of had this line which was quite similar to the angle of the club shaft. Yeah. We're going to kind of just shift that plane and put it out here. >> Okay. >> So, what I'm doing now is if you look at this alignment stick here, it's kind of matched up with this one here. >> And what I'm going to do, I'm going to put it in the ground about the angle of your driver shaft that setup. Now, obviously, I'm not going to say to you hit full shots because you're probably just going to hit that straight away. So, what I'm going to do, I'm going to get rid of that >> hands on the golf club for me and just keep looking down to where the ball would be. Almost kind of go into impact for me without doing There we go. Beautiful. Now, from here, >> this is more what Andy was just talking about earlier. See how the hands are tracing around >> and the club head is coming more around. >> Now, relative to plane, you're still going to be on plane. >> Your club path numbers, if you were hitting a shot like that would may even be slightly to the right, >> but as soon as you do this, exaggerating it. Mhm. >> That's where we're just saying there could be a slight issue. >> So, from here, let's just hover it slightly above the tea. >> Go into impact for me with the body. And then from there, swing the club more around your body. >> Let's just get you doing that a few times. I'm going to watch you do it. Do no back swing. There we go. Beautiful. And there we go. Beautiful. And make sure you complete the finish. Yeah. Give me a few more of those little swings. Maybe swing back to halfway. Beautiful. Now, swing through. Beautiful. Good. Let's keep doing that. And when you feel comfortable that you won't hit the stick, just start putting a little bit more speed into it. >> There you go. And whatever feeling you create from that, we'll we'll test out and see. >> Yeah, it just feels like my hands are finishing lower. >> And it can be as simple as that. It can be >> more inside. It can be as simple as I'm just going to finish with >> we spoke to Colin Morau years ago >> and we were trying to pull out the real technical stuff from his golf >> from his golf swing and we're like >> how do you you know can you talk us through how he says well I just if I want to play a draw I'll I'll finish high. If I want to play a fade I'll finish low and it was just as simple as that but that simple cue >> organized everything else to produce exactly what he wanted. >> Let's chip on. >> Okay. >> Let's do a little mini swing. >> A full through swing but it's going to go 50 yards. Yeah. >> I I just want you to chip it. >> Not worried about speed at all. >> That's good. Pretty good. Good, >> man. >> I was so focused on staying under, I forgot. That's good. >> That's okay. >> What was the shot shape? >> A little fade. >> Little fade. >> Little fade. >> Now, we're not saying we want you to hit a fade, but >> Y. >> Okay. Club on the way back. Beautiful on plane. Go slightly above. Get slightly under. But on the way through now, it's more fade probably because the heel strike. >> Yeah. >> But look at the club now on the way through. As much as that felt like it was going really low and around, >> it's still I wouldn't say it's on the high side. I say that's in a really nice window. Do me a favor. Look at the club path. >> Yeah. >> Okay. It's from 5 to 0.3. >> Yep. >> Let's keep going. >> Nice. >> That looks really He looks I mean >> JJ spawn on the way through. That is >> You look like a golfer. You didn't look I'm not saying you didn't look like one before, but now you really do. >> All right. >> All right. We're making progress. That was really good. >> And look at that number. That was a bit more free as well. You sort of relaxed into that one a little bit more. >> One or two. >> Yeah. One degree to the right. Nice. >> Beautiful. Now notice that one didn't really move off the target line that much at all. >> That was money. >> Yeah. >> And you said you want to hit it straight. That'll that'll that'll do it. 0.6 will do it. >> Yeah. I mean the thing for me is now that >> when you would do before when you did this >> the club would go super high and it kind of looked like you were trying to position after that. Now it just like >> the flow. Andy mentioned JJ Spawn. I'm seeing bit of Colin Moricara in there as well. >> Must be a Southern California thing cuz those boys, you know, they're from around here. >> I'll take that comparison any day of my life. >> You look at Spawn. We we stood next to Spawn at the range at the US Open. His finish was was like here. So these this low finish that you're talking about, you watch JJ spawn, he's just like and it's very hard when your finish is sort of left and low. It's very hard to get active with the hands. It's very hard to do this. >> So good good swing to model. >> I' I've noticed my worst shots on the range. Do exactly what you're talking about. I I finish really high. my club. I I keep my cell phone in my back pocket. Actually hits my cell phone on my worst shots. >> Yeah, >> because of that high finish. Just >> Wait till you show your brother your new swing. >> Be the uh Yeah, he won't be uh won't be charging you so much in damages. Okay, let's keep going. >> Let's um Yeah, just just naturally hit them a little harder. >> That's fine. >> Sorry, guys. That was There was always a chance. >> For me and my golf alignment stick, it's very very tough. Let's move it. Let's move it back just a little bit. Andy, we'll keep it in still. >> Great audio. That was >> again, club path was good, though. It was only 1.1 to the right. It just meant that obviously the face was just maybe a smidge open. But let's just hit this one. Let's go 50 yards again. >> Okay. Okay. >> Okay. Beautiful. And if we get one that goes like that, then that's probably just down to down to the face more than anything. That's just it's >> where we know it doesn't break down. >> Yeah. >> Now, let's go 70% effort. >> Okay. >> So, I don't know. What's this? 220. >> Give me a 220 yard drive. >> Nice. >> It's good. >> Okay. Let's go with a normal. >> Let's go with a full one. >> What do you think the number's going to be? I'm I'm going to challenge you on this one. >> Two >> to the to the right. >> Yeah. Have a look. I think he's right. >> Two. Yeah. >> Yeah. 2.1. >> Yeah. Yeah. >> Really good. >> So, let's have a look at this. Top one is the original. >> The first one from today. >> Again, we can see the club head. Look how Look how much gap there is between that and the plane on the way through. >> Here's the mini swing, the chip swing. Club still travels underneath slightly. Slight heel strike on that one. But look at the club here. >> That is what we're talking about. So when you swing through now, it looks more like that as opposed to like that crash. Look at that. You just you just you just smash the ceiling. >> I can play at my brother's house. >> You go. Absolutely. >> But now you understand why that happens. It's like, well, actually, I've just got to go this way. >> So, you're going to save you're going to save uh money on drivers, money on the ceiling, and money on iPhones. >> Absolutely. >> Because you're not smacking your ass anymore. >> That's why I got that heavy case on it. But if you look at it here, it's almost like that's a little bit more old school type. This is more modern school as far as finishes are concerned. So if we compare the full swing to what we've just done, we can still see that it still wants to move away. It's not quite as good as the chip swing relative to the plane. If I sync those two, we can see that the club still wants to go higher when it comes to that. >> The objective is this is better than what we've seen at the beginning of the lesson. >> Yeah. But how can we get closer to the bottom one >> before we finish? >> Yeah. >> Yeah. I >> think just more repetition. >> Give more exaggeration as well. Repetitions absolutely. But just like don't care where the ball goes. You can miss it, top it, hook it, slice it. Just give me the move. Okay. >> Get get that get that body moving. >> I can do that. >> Beautiful. Still got the draw. Nice. Let's go again. >> 5.7 right on that one. So we can go more. >> Give me more. Give me more. Get it going lower. So go have a shorter back swing >> and then really low and left. However you got to do. There we go. >> I mean >> there's a shot. >> So good. >> Call the number. >> Two yards of fail. >> I'm going to call it as well after you. You say I haven't looked. >> I've got my number. I'm holding my finger up for the number. Two degrees to the right. He's saying two degrees to the right. I'm going to say 0.4 to the right. >> I'm going to go one. I'm going to go one to the right. >> 0.5 to the right. Oh, 0.5. But because that ball just went so straight, I'm like, that ball started online and didn't move. It had to be close to Had to be close to zero. That was beautiful. >> Yeah. >> Okay. Guess the number. >> Guess we'll all play on this one. >> I'm going zero. Oh. >> Uh, one and a half. >> One and a half. Left or right? >> To the right. >> To the right. Ali >> 88. Right. >> 0.4. Oh, I'm gonna go 0.2. >> Oh. >> Oh my gosh. He's on fire. >> Good though. But now you can just see with how straight that went again. It's like has to be close. Has to be close to zero. >> Awesome. Yeah. And that that was just the fade thought. >> Fade feel. Yeah. Good. >> And it went straight. So, >> okay. So, here we go. Look at this. This was your old swing. Club massively away from the plane. The chip swings we know are really good. And that's exactly where you've got to live. But the swing on the bottom now is where you are on your new one. That's 0.5. Look how much closer the club head is to the path there. That is so much better. And if we just sort of keep it going on the way through, we can see the height of the club is so different on the way through. This is what's making the path more neutral. This is absolutely brilliant. >> Well done. >> Awesome. Thank you guys. Super helpful >> guys. Hope you enjoyed that.
