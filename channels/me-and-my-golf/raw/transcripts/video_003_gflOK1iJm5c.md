## Raw Transcript

Welcome back. Now, in today's live lesson, we've got Dan. Dan is struggling with his striking, with his irons, often hitting them fat or thin. The good news for Dan is when he hits it, it goes miles. That's beautiful. It's my job today is to understand why we're getting these mis hits. I've already spotted one main thing. Let's find out what happens. That's one of those It's a weird one because that one it sounded really nice. >> Yeah. But you're such a high-speed player that even your mis hits sound quite good. Okay. All right. Let's look at this. Let's look at the analysis. Now, the good news is I've got two shots on here. I've got one with you nuking it and one with you fattening it. So, this is really good. >> So, there's so many good things going on. When what I will say, we'll look at the front on view. First of all, this is the one that you actually hit heavy. >> If I look at this here, the yellow line is the impact line. I'm really interested in that. If you can get to that impact line, that's a real good thing for ball striking. >> If we have a look what happens in your swing, ex volleyball player, so you know how to move. We were just talking about Micah Morris. That's what made him so long. >> Look at that left hip. Look at that left shoulder. >> You're on that impact line really early. >> Okay. >> So, straight away when I see that, I'm going, hm, that's it's nothing to do with shifting. You're good at shifting towards the target. >> But do me a favor. Check out the head in the orange box. >> Look what it does. Look how much you lose height in your down swing. So you can see you're about to hit the ground there. You just hit the ground there. Well, you can literally see what's that 3 in before the ball. But look how much the head has dropped. Okay, bear that in mind. The one on the right, we nuked it. Absolute ripper. 190 um 190 yards. Like unbelievable. >> Watch the head on this one. By the way, swing plane is amazing. Club swings down really close to the plane. It's really consistent for me. Watch the head though. It drops H. I would say that's dropped less. >> We can see probably an inch or two less that's actually dropped. >> So the the good shots for you at the moment depend on how much your head goes down when you're hitting a golf ball. If it goes down less, >> it makes sense at the moment from what we can see that you're probably going to strike it better. >> Okay. >> But we have to understand why is it doing that? Now it's quite dark to see here from this front on view, but I'm just going to show you here. Look at the gap between your elbows from when they start >> Mhm. >> to when they get to impact. And we can see that the elbows, they get a little bit f Yeah. They flare out and they get wider. So if we think about, you can see that left arm is what we would call a chicken wing. If we look at it from down the line as well, it really sort of sticks out. If we think of this, if you start with your elbows like this, but then you spllay them like this, look what happens to the club. The club gets pulled into my body, >> right? So the radius of our swing >> decreases >> shortens. It decreases. There's a couple of ways we can get the club back down to the ball. And one of them is let's just go down like that. So let's just drop our head into the ground to make up for that or are you doing that because your head is going down? So it's kind of like chicken in the egg. I've already done a couple of little physical screens off camera. You didn't know why I was doing them. So I kind of did a 9090. You passed that. I did a lat length test. You pass that. >> Okay. So it's not sorry it's it's not a physical issue it's you it's your golf swing. So what I need to explore with you now is can we hit some mini shots where we are just getting the arms extended. And I'm just going to get you to literally swing through. So we're literally going to hit a shot where we short back short through. We're making sure our body is really moving as yours is. So doing a really good job on the body movement still. But we're just going to see if we can get those arms extended. >> Okay. >> Now, if you can become good at that exercise, we call it like um set to point. If we can tidy up what happens through here, that could be a big difference for you. So, to make sure that we're not thinking too much on strike to start with, >> okay, >> I'm going to tear it up for you. And anyone doing this drill for the first time, if you're someone who's chicken winging like this, this drill is absolutely perfect for you. So, just have a few practice swings for me and just show me what that looks like. like what I just said without even hitting the ball just yet. So, a real sort of mini back swing and you can stop. Beautiful. And then from there, swing through and stop at this stage on the way through. Beautiful. So, almost want to be here. So, it's almost like >> imagine there's some branches here and a tree and you got to you got to chip it out the fairway. I know you're not normally missing fairways, but just in case you ever do, you're trying to hit this like low punch back onto the fairway and you're really feeling that the you're trying to squeeze those elbows together. Make sense? Yep. >> Okay, cool. Show me that again without hitting a shot. Okay, that's fine. You just broke your club. Yeah, >> that's okay. >> Beautiful. That's good. >> And I like you're still doing this at speed as well. So, this this ball will probably still go about 120. >> Yep. >> 130. I'm fine with that. >> I I'm going to ask you a question, >> right? If you become, let's just say that straight away the first five shots you nail the arms, >> what kind of shots do you think you might hit? >> If the head were to go down >> and your arms are extended, what could happen? Fat. >> Yeah, you could fat a few. >> So, we may fat a few to start with, >> but as this is a great point because someone could look at this drill and say, I'll try that and hit three shots and go, that was rubbish. I'm hitting it worse. All we need to understand is >> we don't know which one's happening because of which. I think this is happening and you're doing that to compensate it. >> Okay. >> But if we can actually get that worked out, then the head is probably naturally just going to have to with time go. Oh, now I have permission to move a bit freer through the hit as opposed to going down. >> Makes sense. >> So stick there, stick there, stick there. This is really good. I don't think we could make that gap any smaller. >> Yep. >> I like it. >> Finish there. Finish there. Finish there. Beautiful. A little bit clean. >> Okay. All that nonsense I was talking about. You might hit a few fat. Obviously, I don't know what I'm on about. >> This is quite a nice shot, isn't it? >> Yeah. >> Maybe I just play that. >> Have you ever played golf in Scotland? >> Uh, once. >> Okay. When you go back, use this shot a lot cuz he did it that low when it comes to Scotland. >> So, stay there. Stay there. Stay there. Stay there. Stay there. Stay there. Stay there. That's as good as it gets. Stay there, though. This is amazing. Your whole body's worked and everything's gone. Look at this here. And Ali's gonna come and have a look at this. >> How often do you see that on a par three when you're playing? >> Never. >> Never. Okay. TEG here. Divot starting an inch after. That is like >> That's so That's so good. >> That's so good. You've hit four or five in a row. Yeah. >> Yeah. >> Teg's still there. And there's no grass before it. And there's divots happening after the teg. That's like money. >> Yeah. and start calling you Tommy Fleetwood soon. >> That noise that that's what we're after. >> Yeah. >> This is the point when you're going, "Why the hell did I do this before?" >> Exactly. Years of my life wasted. >> Full disclosure, this isn't 6 months later after his first lesson. He We didn't stop the video and come back 6 months later. What you're about to see now is exactly what's happened from just doing that drill. This is so good. Right. Watch this one. One on the left. Orange box. That was the original. Look at the head. Look at the head. Look at the head. Goes down, down, down, down, down. Let's look at this one here. This is the set to point drill. You still get the shifting really good. It still drops a little bit, >> but look at the difference on this one. And we know that Yeah, we're talking I mean what we're talking there 2 in higher. >> Yeah, >> but if we think about that, 2 in is a lot. I got to be careful how I say that. But 2 in is a lot, ladies and gentlemen. But if we look at this here, you're still up on the lead side. If we look at the legs as well, the legs are getting less divy as well. So we can see that the legs aren't diving into the ground. The head's not going down too much. And then let's just see if I can watch these on the way through. Look at the elbows there on the left. Sorry, on the right compared to the ones on the left. I mean, it looks like >> big difference. >> I mean, it's a huge difference when it comes to that left arm and what it's doing. Awesome work from Dan there. much better ball striking, much better compression, and hopefully more consistency. Now, look, if you want to do exactly what Dan's done, we have taken him through our Pure Your Iron system. It's a five-step system that if you follow through in order, it'll show you exactly why you're struggling with compression with your irons. All you need to do is click that link down there below. It'll give you everything you need. Thanks so much. We'll see you soon.
