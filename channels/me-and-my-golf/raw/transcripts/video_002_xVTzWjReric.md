## Video Description

What's the real difference between hitting your Driver and your Irons? 🤔
We headed to TPI (Titleist Performance Institute) to find out from co-founder Dave Phillips — one of the world's leading experts on the body–swing connection.

Using years of 3D motion capture and ground force data, TPI has uncovered what separates the best players from the rest — and why you should never treat your Driver and Iron the same.
