So this is Michael. Michael is a three handicap golfer who's struggling with his driving. He's missing it right and left and just struggling to find consistency. Now we got Michael in the golf ball so much straighter by changing one simple thing in his setup and then changing his golf swing without actually changing his golf swing. You're going to learn how important ball position is and how you can find yours and how you can change your golf swing without getting too technical. Okay then, Michael. So let's take a look at the golf swing. I mean, you're hitting some beautiful shots, but we can see there is a two-way miss there. Um, let's go down the line first. Take a look at this. We've got the swing plane line in here. Something that you may be aware of when you've seen this before that when we go when we start the down swing, you know that you fire your hips really fast. A lot of speed there. We've seen up to 116 mph. We can see how much you fire that lower body, which is brilliant. We just want to just want to see where the club is. You can see this club now just swinging down a little inside or underneath the plane, which is why you're getting an average of 5.5 path to the right. >> So, your path is 5.5 to the right and your attack angle is 5.5 on the way up. >> Mhm. >> Okay. This is fine when you hit the ones really nice, but we know that you can either push it or you can hit the one that that that dives left. So, we're definitely going to have a look at this and see if we can get this a little closer. I want to just highlight a couple of things here, though. So, I put a box around your head here. Now, I'm not because I want to keep your head still. I just want to highlight something to you. So, if we swing back here, what we're going to notice is that you have a little bit of a move away from the, you know, from the target to the right, to the right, to the right of the box or to the left as we look at it, >> which is positioning you right on that right leg. You are primed ready to hit up on the golf ball and really loading that trail leg. So from here now it's going to be very easy for you to hit up on the golf ball coupled with the fact your ball position is quite far forward. So you got a ball position which is sort of let's say opposite the the left big toe and we've got a move which is you moving away from the golf ball. >> Mhm. >> So really good for driver but hit up on the golf ball. But when I look at yours it's almost a little too much. >> Mhm. >> Now I don't want to take this away. Not yet. I don't think I want to explore today of how we can get this a little bit more predictable because you still want to play a draw. We just want to really take out the two-way miss. >> Um, if we just take a look from here again, again, we can see that you really use that lower body amazingly well. You sort of get this squat down and start to rotate. You can see those hips working really well here. And then you push up off the ground. There's a jump through the ground here. This is great for power. This is why you hit the golf ball really well. A lot of great drivers, powerful drivers do this. I certainly don't want to take any of that away, >> but I want to see if we can create a more predictable ball flight. So, my starting point for you is the left one is the predominant miss that you want to get rid of. And you can stand on the tea and go, well, >> which way is it going to go? If I hit it wrong, I want to take that away. I want to make it more of a right miss for you. >> Can we get you to hit it right in almost every shot? >> Mhm. >> And the only thing I'm going to do is move your ball position back. So with your ball position, let's say off the front foot here, coupled with the fact that we move off and have this sway, it's so easy then to to hit up on the golf ball and you couple that with a path that's inside, it's so easy for that face to want to shut down. So you hit it very late in the arc and the later you hit it in the arc, the more chance the face is going to be closed. >> If I move the ball back in the stance, >> couple of things happen. We're actually going to move your path more to the right, >> which sounds quite strange because we don't want that, >> but we're going to move it more to the right, but we're also going to do is we're going to hit it earlier in the arc, which means the face is going to be less closed. >> Yeah. >> So, what I'm hoping we do in this first few is we're going to increase the path to the right short term. You're going, "Hang on a minute. What's going on?" Shortterm, but all I really care about is the ball flight. How can we get your ball just missing right? And then my plan is how do we then bring it back? >> Gotcha. >> So let's let's start first of all with ball position. And I'm going to move it a little further back than you where you'd normally have it. So you would normally, let's say, be here. >> Mhm. >> We're going to have it here. It's probably going to feel like this to you, which I'm which I I hope it does. >> But let's just hit a few shots where we just go inside this foot >> and let's see what happens. >> What does that feel like straight away? >> Definitely feels like it's further back. >> Further back. Yeah. Y. >> Okay. So, let's just have a few shots and we'll see what happens. >> Good. >> The feeling that one was >> like I didn't have enough time to clear. >> Correct. Correct. And that shot there started right and went further right. >> Yeah. >> I'm really happy with that. I don't want you to hit the target yet. >> We're going to get you there, but there's a plan. There's there's method to the madness here. >> Okay. Good. Two shots to plan. We're on plan. That's all I'm saying. We're on plan. >> Yep. >> So, club path now is 6.6 to the right. >> Mhm. >> One thing that's always funny when me and Pierce deliver golf lessons, we when people hit poor shots like that, we're like, great, good shot. >> Like, that's good. That's good. That's what we want to see. People like, what? That was that was nowhere near the fairway. >> But it's all part of just the process. >> Okay, good. So notice notice how it's starting to >> Yeah, it's >> it's starting but it's almost starting to come back a little straighter. The first one was more right. That one now is sort of working its way back. Y >> let's keep going. And you're not having I'm not telling you to do anything with your golf swing. >> No, this is purely just ball position right now. >> Yeah. But I am going to tell you to do something with your golf swing in a minute. >> So the goal of the next part of the session is now we've seen a few shots just continuously miss right. Now we go, well, how do we now bring that back to center? >> Mhm. still have a path that's slightly to the right, but how do we just make it a little bit more predictable? Y and we'll do that really by changing your intention in the golf swing really. So, I've placed this on the target line here. Every one of your golf balls is starting >> over here. And let's say your path is at the minute it's like seven° to the right. >> What I'd like us to to experiment with, I want to see >> if we can feel that your path is going to be more left. Now, I don't want it left because we want to play a draw. I still want it right, but I want it here, not here. >> Y >> 70°. If we got it to four or or sub four, that would be nice. >> If we got it to four, that's going to give you a really controlled draw. >> But to feel that, we're probably going to feel like we've got a path that's left. >> So, if I said to you from a square setup, could you play me a fade? >> Could you do that? Sure. >> So, basically, start it left of this Yeah. >> Yeah. >> And then get it to work back there. >> That's the That's the challenge I want you to do. >> Okay. Beautiful. >> Has to be different. Yeah. >> Yeah. Has to be different. I'm not I haven't looked yet, but let's have a little look. Bottom right. >> Okay. What does the bottom right number say? >> 1.8 left. >> 1.8 left. Okay. That's way too much. >> Yeah. >> But you felt the extreme of where you needed to. >> So great. You know what that feels like now. You went a little slower to do it as well. Your attack angle was still 1.4 up there. >> Mhm. >> Even though you're probably feeling like down and left. >> Yeah. I feel like I was smothering it. >> Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Let's go again. Little bit more speed in this one, but I want you feeling the same. Still feeling fade. Where did it start? Where did that ball start in relation to that line? >> Pretty much dead on. >> Pretty much dead on. Yeah. So, look at the path number on that. 2.3 to the right. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. still carried it 299. >> Really good ball flight. Yeah. >> So instead of you looping it underneath and hitting the slinger now you're like >> that was drilled. >> Yeah. Yeah. >> Really nice. >> Yeah. Very good. >> Yeah. I love it. >> Really nice golf shot. >> Hardly any movement off the target line on that one. That was That was Look at that. >> Yeah. 1.2. >> Very good. Very good. >> Really good. And we haven't changed your golf swing. Well, we have, but we haven't worked at it, if that makes sense. >> Yeah. >> We're just reacting and having a different intention compared to what you're used to. >> Wasn't quite as ripped, was it? But beautiful golf shot. >> Yeah. Right on line. >> Right on target line. 1.8 path to the right. >> And we just now what we just need to do is like >> green. >> Keep doing this. Keep doing this. Keep doing this. And and I've got no qualms of view that this is going to work isn't going to work because you've done it straight away. >> Yeah. There you go. >> There you go. >> Yeah. >> Package that up and let's take that away. Let's take that away. But that I mean that's brilliant. >> What a difference there in a short space of time. >> Okay, let's just take a look at the difference here. So obviously we can see ball position from face on. That's fine. The left screen here is you at the start of the session. So if we take a look at this, we'll see how that club on the way down got very much underneath. So you mentioned stuck before. So that that would be a little stuck. And we haven't changed the I haven't said to you slow the hips down. I don't want you to slow your hips down >> cuz they work they work really well. You can see we just swung a little under and a little over on the way through. Couple that with the ball position forward brings left into play. M. >> Now, let's look at the take a look at this one. This is you feeling fade. >> What's the difference here? Back swing isn't any different. >> Mhm. >> Down swing, what we're going to see. >> Now, this club, >> you're working. >> Okay. It's pretty much smack on that line. So, that is the reason now that we're able to hit it as straight as you are and not hit it left. >> Mhm. >> So, you're a very different golfer compared to your warm-up. Now, all I would say is you just need to feel and practice that a lot. Yeah. >> And get the feedback with launch monitor. >> Great stuff. >> Yeah. >> Good work from Michael. Look, hope you guys enjoyed that.
