## Full Transcript

Okay, we are talking down swing sequence today with probably the best person in the world to talk about this. We've got Dave Phillips, co-founder of TPI. One of the most common questions that we get asked is down swing. What should I feel? How should I start it? Should I be starting with the arm? Should I be starting with the legs? If you can describe the difference between kinematic sequence and then kinetic sequence, what's the difference between those two?

>> Right in front of me here, we have two force plates, right? These give me what we call kinetics. Kinetics are your ground forces. It's how movement is created. So when people talk about rotation, they talk about movement of the club, there's a force applied to the ground. You know, if you lift your feet off the ground or you sit in a chair and your feet are off the ground, you try and swing a club, you'll be moving all over the place. You can't generate any real speed. But when we apply a force into the ground, Newton's law says it's equal and opposite. So the more I push, the more the ground pushes back, and that creates a movement pattern, right? So, think of kinetics about how I'm using force to create movement, right? And there's a sequence to that. And think of kinematics as 3D motion capture. So, you'll see these cameras. I think we have 16 in this room. We put some markers on you and we're able to look at how the body is moving in relation to the ground force. Right? So, here's how you're pushing and where you're pushing and here's what's happening.

So in the down swing sequence when you look at good players if we're looking at kinematics which is 3D basically what you see is everybody basically gets to the top of that back swing and then think of it as a four-horse race. The lower body is the first first horse and it gets to the gate and the gate goes off and the doors open at the racetrack and the lower body comes out first. So the lower body that little movement that little push back goes first. It's not some huge move. It's a lot smaller than you realize and it happens much quicker. But the first horse that comes out is the lower body horse, right? Followed by the second horse which we call the trunk and that starts to turn, right? And then the lead arm starts to go and then finally the club. So there's this fourhorse race which is you'll hear a lot of times they have great sequence. You can't see sequence on video. It's not possible. that's what you think you're seeing and you can guess, but it's just a guess. You really need high-speed cameras and the ability to track motion to be able to look at the kinematic sequence.

But what we see in the best players in the world is we see that lower body start first. Then there's a force applied. It starts to slow and it transfers the energy to the next segment. Transfers the energy the next segment and hopefully it delivers the club as the fourth segment.

>> Yeah. When the sequence is off, we can get all kinds of things happen. So, if for instance, I get to the top of that race, right? I'm in the gate and instead of the lower body going force, the trunk decides, ah, screw you. I'm going first. And it goes, well, now all of a sudden, it kills the lower body and the lower body's like, well, I can't even catch up. It's destroyed me. It's almost like it's pulled me out of the way. And now the club is steep because I'm twisting and now I'm maybe like someone that hits it over the top. They're usually upper body's going first and that creates this steepness and then all kinds of things can happen coming down. So there's a specific sequence of motion and that's why when you look at great players we often say, "Wow, they swing so slow but they hit it so far."

>> Effortless. The movement looks effortless, isn't it?

>> That's right.

>> But it's the transfer from the ground up through to the club.

>> And this happens in every sporting motion. If you look at a sprinter coming out of the blocks, you look at a good runner, I mean, we've all driven down the road and you see that person with the leg kicking out, you're like, you shouldn't be running.

>> That's Pierce, by the way.

>> And then you see that person that's just everything is just that's a kinematic sequence, the way they're using their body. So, every sport, every motion, you could study that. In fact, they use these systems on the horses today and they use them on all kinds of athletes. We have a baseball lab there. We look at NFL quarterbacks, MLB. We're looking at that same kind of sequence and it nearly always happens the same in a rotary type sport.

>> And is that is that influencing more efficiency of how they transfer the energy to the golf ball?

>> Yes. So that's a good question. So it it it makes that smoothness happen, right? It's just like everything it looks so slow, but because the sequence is so well put together and the slowing down and speeding up of segments occurs so effortlessly, boom, you get that crack of the whip at the end. It's just like the crack of the whip instead of the movement of the whip, right? So, so that that's kinematics. That's the movement of the body. Kinetics is how we're pushing against the ground.

And what we see with kinetics and force is again there's a sequence to that that the best players have and it can explain why they hit certain shots and why some players prefer a fade to a draw or you know you might live on that half of the golf course and someone else may live on that half and they may be perfectly good. So the way to think about that is in kinetics the way we're pushing starting the down swing is we always see this little bit of lateral and that's usually as they're going that's the horse coming out of the gate right that's that raceh horse but it's also kinetics they've moved they've applied force into the ground first that's what the best do now when they do that there's equal and opposite there's a break that happens and that break tends to create this tilt so now we get side bend bend.

And what side bend does is it shallows the club. And then once the club is down in front of us, we need to deliver it to the ball. So then we have what we call horizontal torque or rotation, right? Which brings the club out in front of us. And then to get rid of these angles that we've created, vertical force allows me to deliver those angles into the back of the ball. And there's a very common sequence we see with the best. And it happens way earlier than people think. So in kinetics everything has happened their peak forces from top to about lead arm parallel from here to here all of this into the ground side bend twisting and vertical forces happened and we're not even close

>> in sort of a foot.

>> Exactly. And the reason you want to see those connect kinetic forces happen earlier is the more force I can apply to the ground get through the body the more I can deliver to the club head. So the earlier I can create that, the more speed I can crack into that whip at the end. And that's kind of how that happens.

>> You can't think about this in the golf swing. It's impossible. But this is the science behind what's going on. Kinetics and kinematics. And there's a very specific sequence to it. Now, I said earlier about kinetics. There's this slight lateral. It's usually happening as the lead arm gets parallel to the ground. Players are already starting to get into position. they're already pushing into this side, right? So you see this happen very early and this creates this chain re reaction, right? So we get that little bit of lateral, we get that little bit of side bend, we get what we call twist and then vertical force.

Now say you're twisting early and you've forgotten or you don't have this move,

>> which is a lot of amateur golfers,

>> which is a lot of amateur golfers. This is why I'm saying this. So, you may love graphs. You may love kinetics, kinematics, but here's the simplicity to this. If you live on this side of the golf course for a right-handed player, your ball starts to the left, you slice it, or you hit pulls, then probably you're most likely twisting early. So, you've forgotten to have a little lateral, which shallows the club and gives it a head start. You're just, "Hey, I'm going to kill this thing." And you start twisting. And that gets the club steepening and then all of a sudden we're holding on for dear life and we've got our slice.

So if you're one of those players that is a twister, what do you need? You need lateral. So think of it that way. Say, you know, I'm a slicer of the golf ball. People talk to me about I'm too steep and I'm over the top. Well, why don't you go to the range and just practice hitting a few balls where you just feel like you're going to go lateral because guess what? You're still going to twist, but I need to add some lateral. And I don't think you have to think about the others. I just think you need a better head start with lateral and see what happens because I think you'll be shocked at what happens.

>> The great thing that you guys always say, you say, "Look, force precedes motion." Yes.

>> And for somebody who's a twister or an early rotator, there's a certain force being applied in the ground. There is,

>> which is more of a let's say a a push back with the right and a push forward with the left.

>> Exactly. So if they need to create a little bit more lateral, the force that they need to go that way is more of a pushing.

>> It is. So now you're going one step further, right? I was trying to simplify.

>> Sorry. I'm I'm so eager to dive into it.

>> So now you're going into what's happening with the actual foot and now we're talking talking against the ground, right? So that's another step to this is that yes, you're right in that they could be going this way, which creates the twist, right? And we need to get a little bit more of lateral forces like we're pushing the ground apart. So, you know, the feeling of spreading the ground, the feeling of pushing it this way might be a good sensation or feeling for them to get that little bit. Yeah.

>> Or it might be as simple as, hey, I just need a little bump. I need a I need to go a little that because I'm a twister. Yeah. Right. And that's a great way to think about it without getting caught up in what this is doing.

>> Yeah.

>> Right. And vice versa for my good players who good players tend to struggle. You know, we get the early extenders that tend to block it to the right or they hit a little bit of a hook. They might have had a back issue or a knee or shoulder. I see a lot of good players that over time they've been athletes, they've hurt themselves and all of a sudden that knee starts kicking in and that's like a shock absorber. A lot of times we see people that have had back pain, they have a little bit of a knee action because it it's it's softening the blow of what's been going on back here. Yeah.

>> So any of those players, they've got too much lateral. So, what happens with them is, yeah, you know, I've got I've got a bump. I've got to shift my low point. And they go this way with their lower body. So, now the club is behind and under the plane, and all of a sudden, they turn, but it's too late. The path is over there. Once they've hit one or two over there, they release it and now they've got the left. Right. So, on those players, what we need is we need Twisty. Yeah.

>> We need you to do the opposite. So, for you, it would be really good to go, hey, I've been drawing it. I've been hooking it. I can't stop it. go to the top of your back swing and don't think about any of this. You do that way too good. Stabilize it by firing the trunk because the next segment will stabilize the lower body. Yeah.

>> So, a lot of people go, "How do I stop my legs driving?" Well, if I fire my oblique abdominals,

>> they stop my legs driving. I love this analogy with great ball strikers, which literally is going to sum up this kinetic and kinematic because I see this on so many great players, and that is I love players that have long legs and a short torso at impact. They've pushed and driven the ground away and they've stayed in posture. They don't look like this, right? But they have long legs and a short torso. The killer is short legs, softening of the legs. Yeah. Because what happens is as the legs go in underneath me, the chest goes up and now I dump all my angles. And th that's the killer. Watch them at impact. Boom. They look like this.

>> And they're maintaining this angle forward basically here in in their posture. Yeah.

>> They look like this with an iron and they kind of look a little bit back like this with the wood, but their legs have pushed early and they're long.

>> When it comes to the the kinetic sequence, you're saying that as we shift, we create this tilt which shallows the club. Is there any danger in what you see from that when you see people almost trying to manipulate the club into this?

>> Yes.

>> Almost forcing it and are they missing a step by by doing that and not understanding well actually it's much easier to shallow the club this way. I'd love to get your thoughts on that.

>> Yeah. No, I agree with you. I see a lot of that today, you know, where we we get these players that look like they're doing this, right? I don't see that happen. I think that that that might be a feel that someone has that might have been steep, but I don't see that happening. And then I don't see all of this kind of rotation and and holding angle and stuff like that. Good players that I see tend to keep the club more in front of them, not too deep behind them. There are good players that live back here, but the really good ball strikers that have good kinetics and kinematics, they tend to keep that club more away in front. you don't see it. You I mean sometimes you get over rotators and they get it back, but the more in front it is, the easier it is to get it back down in front, right?

So, I'm always looking for efficiency in motion. And the more I can keep a club wide and get it back in front of you, the less variables I have with what you're going to do with wrist and forearm and hands, which change this. And just a little bit of this can have a big effect on that.

>> The message for you guys when it comes to down swing sequence, I think it's a very simple message. understand what your tendencies are, which side you play on and do you need to add a little bit of this or do do you need to add actually a little bit of this and just see, you know, have a go and see what it does for you.

>> Ultimately for you is if you live over here, then play it when you're playing golf, work to minimize it if that's who you are, you know, or you can decide to change it. But an overhaul is a lot more time and effort than a tweak.

>> Yeah. Make sure you also follow these guys over on YouTube. They're putting some incredible stuff out. And don't forget to check out my video where these guys put me through the whole physical screen and identify really what my sequence was like. And I'm still working at it. So, a follow-up to come. Thanks, guys. will say.
