So, you've probably seen this before, a good takeaway and then the arms collapse and get narrow at the top. This is exactly what Mike was doing and it was the root cause of his weak slice. Now, in this lesson, we're going to show you how we created proper width so he could square the club face and it instantly got him hitting the golf ball straighter and longer.

>> Strangely enough, I would be okay with that shot

>> because I could find it.

>> Yeah,

>> I could find it. I could play it.

>> So, we have a look at this top screen here.

>> Yep. So, we'll actually see how you have a really nice turn here. The torso does a really good job. The hips are doing a good job.

>> And then you get to about here

>> and then the back surgery kicks in. And goes, "Nope, you're not going anymore, Mike. Not today." That's right.

>> And the hips stop.

>> The torso stops. The arms then carry on. Now, as a result of that, it makes you short on turn here, short on turn here. Y

>> and also as a result of that it makes the arms quite narrow at the top of the back swing.

>> I see that.

>> Does that make sense?

>> So we have a we have a limited mobility or limited rotation and then it gets in narrow.

>> Now what this causes now that narrowness and also if you look at this one here again the lighting is not amazing but you'll also see look at the hips now. Can you see that? Okay

>> I can.

>> The hips are now they're not they're not turning this way anymore.

>> They're actually starting now already to start turning. You haven't finished the club yet going to the top, but your hips are already opening out.

>> So your hips at this stage here are almost back to 0 degrees and the club's only here,

>> right?

>> So at this stage here now, you're very rotated. You're very narrow and there's only one place the club can go, which is over the top of the plane. And that's why your club path on these, that one there was 3.1 left. You've had anything from five and six degrees left, but you're going to be swinging over the top

>> and cutting across it.

>> Yep.

>> Make sense?

>> Sure does.

>> Now,

>> not the first time I've heard this, by the We've heard that before. Maybe this is the maybe this is the best time we can fix this. That's that's what we're looking for. So, we're going to start with step two. We're going to start with how we can get you to rotate better in your back swing.

>> Now, there's a few ways we can do this. If I can just borrow the club here.

>> If we we can just get you set up square. Now, you can get that right foot and flare it out as much as we like and we can actually pull it back a little bit.

>> I've got no problem with doing that. I just want to make sure that the back feels comfortable on the way through as a result of this. But if we think about this, you saw it with Neil earlier from no laying up, how he wanted to delay his rotation. He was like the Tasmanian devil of rotation. I'm putting you in that category as well. You're really good at rotation. So you've got some good speed here.

>> But what we're looking at now is how can we get you so you're rotated better, so the hips are deeper, a little bit what we spoke about with Ben actually.

>> And then from there, as a result, your arms are hopefully going to be wider and your torso is going to be turned more. the the back swing for you if you can be rotated and wider is going to be so much easier. Now, we have to understand that there's an issue with the back or there has been an issue with the back,

>> but although it's healed up, it can still be a little bit stiff maybe.

>> So, if we can find a way of creating a a setup which allows you to be rotated more,

>> wound up more, deeper with the arms, and wider with the arms, then I'm all in. If we can find that, then we're good. Let's have some practice swings again. I'm just going to put this uh

>> the

>> I'm going to manhandle Mike if he needs manhandle.

>> I think he would enjoy it. I think you're okay.

>> You said practice swings.

>> I'm going to put this This is a cattle broad.

>> Okay.

>> So, don't actually don't don't do a down swing. Just swing back for me. So, big wind up and wide. Okay.

>> You just got shocked.

>> There you go.

>> At this stage,

>> the club's almost vertical in the air now.

>> I do. That's a good That's a good feeling for you to have.

>> You won't do that when you hit a ball, right? There's no chance.

>> There you go.

>> That's really good. Almost

>> really good. This is good. I mean this I want to this is don't sound this looks a little bit like Faldo.

>> That's pretty cool. Maybe longer.

>> Love that. Love that.

>> Okay.

>> Does that feel easy enough to do?

>> Sure. I I definitely feel which is probably the right feeling a lot more tension

>> in the lats.

>> Okay.

>> Not bad tension, just tension.

>> I'm really by the way if we get anywhere close to those back swings today, Mike. Like if we can get anywhere close to that, we are going to they I mean we are going to see some very different shots.

>> I love the right foot. Go. That's nice. Okay. So, your club path average before was like four four or four and a half degrees to the left. 1.1 right on the first swing. Perfect.

>> We could say stop, but we shouldn't. Let's go. Let's play some more. Go.

>> There you go.

>> Now you know what you need to do on the first te. Okay.

>> I mean, that was so good. That was like

>> dead straight.

>> Okay.

>> 1.1°. No, sorry. Half a 7° to the right. A little bit out the toe.

>> So now everything looks wound up and in and in sync.

>> Looks way better.

>> It's like phenomenal.

>> And I would tend to I would tend to collapse my legs together.

>> Okay.

>> Here. Um it seems like I've kept the sort of power. Yeah.

>> And the legs looks looks better. Doesn't really look like me.

>> It's good. He's good.

>> Go.

>> Beautiful. That's what we And I'm okay seeing that. At this stage, I'd like to see a draw. Personally,

>> bottom right number is the path one degree. Right.

>> You've shifted the path four degrees by changing your back swing.

>> You haven't had to think about shallowing.

>> I don't think anyone ever needs to think about shallowing in the golf swing.

>> Okay. That's what I believe.

>> For the most part,

>> it feels very slow slash smooth and the the overall distance is

>> pretty impressive. Yeah.

>> Yeah. 240 carry.

>> Yeah.

>> Go.

>> Was a good miss. Very nice miss

>> off the bottom, but it's still dead straight. Yeah.

>> Look at that there. Blue versus green. Now I know it's only the first It's only the first five shots.

>> Totally. It's It's in a much better. If we stay here now for the 10 shots, they're all going to be very similar to that.

>> Yeah.

>> And it felt like half speed and

>> they're all within.

>> That's what it is. It's crazy. It's probably half effort, but it's not half speed. It's like almost full speed.

>> Okay. No stopping. Just real patient.

>> Okay.

>> Not full speed,

>> right? Okay.

>> Good right foot. I love that. Really nice rotation on the back swing with width and be smooth and patient in transition.

>> Nice.

>> There you go. Beautiful back swing, by the way. Little healy, but

>> yeah, a little bit healy.

>> Beautiful back swing.

>> 0.5 left. So, straight away it's a lot. So, what I would say if I was in the in the true lesson environment with you here,

>> I'd say that's amazing.

>> What we're going to do next, stop at the top. And you're going to stop at the top for five more. So, give me two stop at the tops and then we'll let you hit another four again.

>> Nope. That's fine. I get it.

>> Okay. Stay there. Go.

>> That's the Can you see that one?

>> No.

>> Oh, no. Oh, it's a beautiful high draw.

>> High draw.

>> I know. It felt It felt like a Right. Look at the path. 1.7. Okay. 243 carry.

>> But let's hit this one now. No stopping. That's good enough.

>> Very nice.

>> Sounded great.

>> Yeah. Lovely.

>> I didn't see that one.

>> Lovely. Just slightly down the left hand side, but

>> they're all strong.

>> Now they're all generally in the same direction.

>> Yeah.

>> Consistent now, isn't it?

>> Yeah.

>> Pretty much all going in that same direction.

>> Okay, let's have a look at this. This is such a big difference. I think the key for you now, I mean, look at the number now. That's one degree left, but that's the most is if you're going to go and hit, not that I would recommend hitting 50 drives, but I would say whatever you do, I want 80% of the drives that you hit

>> stopping at the top. Yeah.

>> For the next

>> two months.

>> Sure.

>> And I want to see a video in two months. Look at this back swing now.

>> And look at the width there. Looks good.

>> There's no You can see even see there again it just rotates too quickly and too narrow to start with. Yeah, that's fine. You'll get that with time. But then when we look at this one

>> again, we just know that the club head was miles in front of the hands at this stage here, right there. So, it's just going a little bit in front still more than we want. We know when you do the stop drill,

>> we know that that club head is absolute money.

>> So, when you do a shot

>> where you stop at the top,

>> your golf swing's better. Yeah.

>> So, if we put that into Golf Digest that that's the swing that we would use because the positions are really good.

>> What you need to do now is it's almost like I would relate this to a lot. It's a really stupid way of doing it.

>> We've now drawn

>> Mhm.

>> or painted the Mona Lisa,

>> but we've done it in dot to dot. We need to now smooth it all around.

>> Okay. Okay. Great work, Mike. Brilliant stuff. Hope you guys enjoyed that. Let us know if you got any comments and questions down below about your game. We'd love to help you.
