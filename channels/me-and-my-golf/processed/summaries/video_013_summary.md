**YouTube ID**: t33CC-YLOYw
**Duration**: 8:49

## Overview

This video is specifically designed for complete beginners who are feeling overwhelmed by the abundance of golf instruction available. Me and My Golf distills their coaching wisdom into five fundamental basics that every beginner must master before anything else. The approach is deliberately simple and sequential, focusing on building a solid foundation rather than overcomplicating the learning process. These five basics - proper grip formation, body pivot mechanics, ground contact principles, clubface awareness, and following a structured plan - form the essential building blocks that will accelerate a beginner's journey to playing on the golf course.

## Key Concepts

### 1. The Grip - Build It in the Air

**The Problem with Traditional Grip Building**
- Most beginners try to build their grip with the club on the ground
- This forces the club too vertical in the hand (incorrect position)
- The club should be diagonal across the hand (correct position)

**The Proper Method**
- Hold the club by the shaft with the clubface vertical (square)
- Position the club at eye line, pointing toward belt buckle
- Build the grip in the air, not on the ground

**Left Hand Placement (for right-handed golfers)**
- Rest the club through the middle of the forefinger to the base of the little finger
- Close the hand around the grip
- Thumb sits ever so slightly to the right side of the grip
- Visual checkpoints:
  - See two knuckles on the left hand
  - The V between thumb and forefinger points toward right shoulder
  - Can support the club with just the forefinger with support from the heel/fleshy part of hand

**Right Hand Placement**
- Position at eye line with belt buckle
- Place hand as if shaking hands
- Place across middle of forefinger, base of little finger
- Close the hand with thumb on top
- Right thumb sits over to the left side
- V between thumb and forefinger points toward right shoulder

**Grip Style for Beginners**
- Start with baseball grip (all fingers touching, hands close together)
- Don't overcomplicate with overlap or interlock initially
- Keep hands nice and close together

**Benefits of Proper Grip**
- Controls direction of shots (helps clubface)
- Uses wrists properly to create power
- Gives massive head start for consistent ball striking

### 2. Body Pivot - Turn, Shift, Turn

**The Simple Concept**
- Three-part motion: Turn → Shift → Turn
- How the body moves shapes how the club moves
- Critical for proper striking

**The Backswing - Turn**
- Golf is a rotational sport
- Turn the chest, turn the hips
- NO lateral movement away from target
- Pure rotation in the backswing

**The Downswing - Shift**
- Shift toward the target
- Lateral movement toward the ball

**The Through-Swing - Turn**
- Rotation through impact
- Finish facing the target
- All weight on front leg
- Back foot released all the way up onto toe
- Hips and chest facing target

**Practice Without a Ball**
- Can practice at home or driving range
- Cross arms across shoulders
- Focus on the motion: turn, shift, turn
- Break it down slowly, then blend into fluid motion
- Train the body movement before hitting shots

### 3. Ground Contact - Hit Past the Ball

**The Critical Question**
- Where should you strike the ground relative to the ball?
- Common misconception: strike ground before the ball
- **Correct answer: Strike ground PAST the ball**

**The Proper Sequence**
- Strike the ball FIRST
- Then hit the ground AFTER the ball
- This creates the divot pattern of tour professionals

**Practice Drill - Ground Contact Training**
- Can practice on range mat or grass
- Set up to the side of where the ball would be
- Make practice swings trying to hit ground past ball position
- On a mat, you'll see/feel where you're striking
- Incorporate the "turn, shift, turn" motion
- Focus on low point being past the ball

**Why It Matters**
- Striking ground before ball = inconsistent contact
- Ball-first contact = solid, consistent strikes
- Critical skill for playing well on the course

**Visual Learning**
- Look at where divot is taken relative to ball position
- Ball position is HERE, divot is PAST it
- This is the pattern to replicate

### 4. Clubface Awareness - Open, Square, Close

**Visual Aid Recommendation**
- Use a table tennis paddle to understand concept
- Red side = clubface, Black side = back of club
- Makes the motion more visible and understandable

**The Clubface Reality**
- Clubface is responsible for where ball starts
- Needs awareness of what it's doing throughout swing

**The Proper Motion**
- **Setup**: Clubface pointing at target (square)
- **Backswing**: Clubface opens (can see the "red")
- **Impact**: Returns to square (pointing at target)
- **Follow-through**: Closes (can see the "black")

**The "Handshake" Feel**
- Backswing: Like shaking hands with someone on the right (opens face)
- Through-swing: Like shaking hands with someone on the left (closes face)

**Common Mistake to Avoid**
- Trying to keep face pointing at target throughout swing
- This causes two problems:
  1. Inconsistent direction
  2. Stops body from turning properly

**The Motion Pattern**
- Opening → Square → Closing
- Natural rotation of the clubface
- Understanding this concept produces better motion

### 5. Follow a Plan - Don't Get Lost

**The Information Overload Problem**
- Too much information available on YouTube
- Bouncing from tip to tip creates confusion
- Multiple coaches with different philosophies = getting lost

**The Solution**
- Follow a structured, sequential plan
- Stick with one coaching philosophy
- Accelerate learning with organized progression

**Me and My Golf's Program**
- "How to Play" Level 1, 2, and 3
- Beginner to golf course in two months
- Covers all fundamentals systematically
- Includes short game and putting
- Guides you through first game management

**Benefits of Having a Plan**
- More fun during learning process
- Get to golf course faster
- Avoid confusion and wasted time
- Systematic progression through skills

## Actionable Drills

### Drill 1: Air Grip Building Practice
**Purpose**: Develop proper grip without bad habits
**Equipment**: Any club, ideally training grip glove
**Execution**:
1. Hold club by shaft with clubface vertical
2. Position at eye line pointing to belt buckle
3. Left hand: Place through middle of forefinger to base of little finger
4. Close hand with thumb slightly right of center
5. Check: See two knuckles, V points to right shoulder
6. Right hand: Shaking hands position across forefinger
7. Close hand with thumb on top, slightly left
8. Check: V points to right shoulder
9. Use baseball grip (fingers touching)
10. Repeat 10-20 times until it becomes natural

**Success Markers**:
- Can build grip quickly without thinking
- Checkpoints all align (knuckles, V's)
- Can support club with forefinger alone

### Drill 2: Turn-Shift-Turn Body Motion (No Ball)
**Purpose**: Train proper body movement pattern
**Equipment**: None needed (can do at home)
**Setup**: Golf stance with slight forward bend, flexed knees
**Execution**:
1. Cross arms across shoulders
2. **Backswing**: Turn chest and hips (NO lateral movement)
3. **Downswing**: Shift toward target
4. **Follow-through**: Turn through, face target, weight on front leg, back toe released
5. Start slowly: Turn... Shift... Turn...
6. Gradually blend into fluid motion
7. Repeat 20-30 times
8. Practice daily, even without club

**Success Markers**:
- Finish facing target every time
- All weight on front leg
- Back heel fully released
- No sway in backswing (pure rotation)

### Drill 3: Ground Contact Training (No Ball)
**Purpose**: Learn to strike ground past ball position
**Equipment**: Club, mat or grass
**Setup**: Normal stance but no ball present
**Execution**:
1. Imagine ball position
2. Make practice swing trying to hit ground PAST that spot
3. Use turn-shift-turn motion
4. Focus on low point being past ball
5. On mat: Listen for and feel contact point
6. On grass: Watch divot location relative to ball position
7. Repeat 10-15 times before each range session

**Success Markers**:
- Consistent contact past ball position
- Can see/feel the pattern
- Divot starts after ball location
- Solid, crisp contact

### Drill 4: Clubface Rotation with Paddle
**Purpose**: Understand and feel proper clubface rotation
**Equipment**: Table tennis paddle (or club)
**Setup**: Normal golf stance
**Execution**:
1. Hold paddle like golf club (red = face, black = back)
2. Setup: Red facing target
3. Backswing: Open face (see red clearly)
4. Through-swing: Close face (see black)
5. Feel the "handshake" motion on both sides
6. Make slow motion swings focusing on face rotation
7. Progress to normal speed
8. Transfer feel to actual club

**Success Markers**:
- Can clearly see face opening and closing
- Feels natural, not forced
- Body turns freely with face rotation
- No attempt to "hold" face square

## Key Takeaways

1. **Build Your Grip in the Air** - Never build grip with club on ground; this forces poor hand position. Club should be diagonal across hand, not vertical.

2. **Master Turn-Shift-Turn** - Simple three-part motion for body: rotate back, shift forward, rotate through. Practice without ball until it's automatic.

3. **Strike Ground PAST the Ball** - Biggest misconception cleared up: hit ball first, then ground after. This is how pros create divots.

4. **Clubface Opens and Closes** - Don't try to keep face square throughout swing. Natural motion is open → square → close, like shaking hands on both sides.

5. **Follow a Plan, Don't Get Lost** - Too many tips from too many sources creates confusion. Stick with one structured program to accelerate learning and get to the course faster.

6. **Simplicity is Key for Beginners** - Start with baseball grip, basic concepts, and fundamental movements. Don't overcomplicate early learning.

7. **Practice Without the Ball** - Many fundamentals (grip, body motion, clubface awareness) can and should be practiced without hitting shots.

8. **Checkpoints Matter** - Use visual checkpoints (knuckles, V's, finish position) to verify you're doing things correctly.

## Notes for Beginners

**Why These 5 Basics Come First**:
1. **Grip** - Affects everything: clubface control, power, consistency
2. **Body Motion** - Shapes club movement and enables solid contact
3. **Ground Contact** - Separates good from poor ball striking
4. **Clubface** - Controls where ball starts and curves
5. **Plan** - Ensures systematic progress without confusion

**Recommended Practice Sequence**:
1. Week 1-2: Master grip building, practice daily
2. Week 2-3: Add turn-shift-turn body motion (no ball)
3. Week 3-4: Combine grip and body motion with club
4. Week 4-5: Add ground contact awareness
5. Week 5-6: Develop clubface awareness
6. Ongoing: Follow structured program to course readiness

**Mental Approach**:
- Don't rush the fundamentals
- Quality repetitions over quantity
- Use checkpoints to self-verify
- Practice doesn't require golf course or range
- Patience with process yields faster long-term results
