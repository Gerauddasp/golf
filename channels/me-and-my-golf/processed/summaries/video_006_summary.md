**YouTube ID**: dnzTRbfIIjo
**Duration**: 15:37

## Overview

In this exceptional collaboration, PGA Tour professional Russell Henley—statistically ranked #1 in the world from 75-100 yards—shares his tour-proven wedge system with Me and My Golf. Unlike typical instructional videos, this provides genuine tour-level insights into distance control, shot selection, and the mental approach that separates elite wedge players from average golfers. Russell demonstrates his systematic approach to wedge play through multiple scenarios, revealing how he achieves remarkable consistency and accuracy in the critical scoring zone.

The session covers not just technique but the strategic thinking behind every shot, including pin selection strategy, managing different lies, choosing trajectory over distance, and developing a reliable distance control system based on 5-yard increments.

## Key Concepts

### The 5-Yard Increment System

- Russell practices wedges in 5-yard increments (90, 95, 100, 105, etc.)
- Each wedge has 3-4 distinct swing lengths that he can reliably execute
- He cannot think about a "97-yard swing" but can execute a confident 95 or 100
- This creates a matrix of distances across multiple wedges for complete yardage coverage
- The system trades pinpoint yardage matching for reliable, repeatable execution
- Practice focuses on owning these specific distances rather than every possible yardage

### Clock System Integration

- 90 yards = 9:00 position
- 95 yards = 9:30 position
- 100 yards = 10:00 position
- 105 yards = 10:30 position
- The clock system provides visual reference points for practice swings
- Small increments but crucial for establishing feel and repeatability

### Strategic Putting Position Over Pin-High

- Russell considers where he wants to putt from BEFORE selecting his shot
- Would rather have a 10-foot straight uphill putt than a 6-foot downhill breaking putt
- On back-to-front sloped greens, being short is better than pin-high
- Jordan Spieth's dominance was partially due to high percentage of straight putts
- "Green light pins" (6+ yards from edge) vs "yellow light pins" (3 yards from edge)
- Pick the side of the hole with the better putt, not necessarily the closest approach

### Less Loft = More Consistency

- Russell prefers hitting controlled shots with less lofted wedges
- Example: Using 51-degree from 100 yards (normally a 120-yard club) instead of full lob wedge
- Less loft guarantees more consistency with spin and flight
- Flatter trajectory = more predictable first bounce and roll-out
- Common amateur mistake: pulling out maximum loft and struggling with height/distance control

### The "Choke Down" Foundation

- Russell chokes down approximately 1 inch on ALL wedge shots
- Applied even on full wedge shots (not just partial swings)
- Benefits: Better contact, shallower angle through turf, promotes body rotation
- Psychological benefit: Sends signal to brain for lower trajectory
- Takes away excessive hand hinge, promotes more body-driven motion
- Creates consistent strike pattern (10,000+ RPM spin on every shot)

### Abbreviated Swing Philosophy

- Wedges use "half aggressive" or "3/4 feeling" swings
- Significantly different from full wind-up with longer irons
- Creates more control without sacrificing necessary distance
- Opposite of longer clubs where you "don't choke down and do the full wind-up"

## Distance Control by Scenario

### 100 Yards - Green Light Pin (6 yards from edge)

**Club Selection**: 55-degree wedge (sand wedge)
**Strategy**: Attack the flag directly, pick side with better putt
**Technique**:
- Neutral swing path
- Choke down 1 inch
- Ball position: feels middle, actually slightly back
- Target swing: 100-yard feel (10:00 on clock)
**Execution Note**: First shot carried 94 yards (felt like 94-95)

### 80 Yards - Risk of Spinning Back

**Club Selection**: Same 55-degree wedge
**Strategy**: Land past hole, let it spin back slightly
**Technique Adjustment**:
- Move ball position half-ball back
- Target 85-yard swing for 80-yard carry
- Creates flatter trajectory (40-45 feet max height vs 50+ feet)
- Margin for error: 80-yard result still acceptable due to reduced spin
**Execution Note**: Carried 79 yards with lower flight and controlled spin

### 100 Yards - Into Wind, Severe Back-to-Front Slope

**Club Selection**: 51-degree wedge (gap wedge - normally 120 yards full)
**Strategy**: Take spin off, land at 95 yards, let it hop and stop
**Reasoning**: 55-degree with spin would rip back too far on slope
**Technique**:
- Shorten backswing significantly (20-yard reduction)
- Same choke-down grip
- Low, penetrating ball flight
- Risk assessment: 15-18 feet past acceptable, but going for tight
**Execution Note**: Carried 91 yards with exceptionally low trajectory

### 75 Yards - Buried Lie in Rough

**Club Selection**: Lob wedge
**Strategy**: Land at 65 yards, short of green, accept 30-foot chip
**Technique - The Cut Shot Method**:
- Ball position back
- Come "over the top" about one degree
- Steeper angle of attack to get more ball contact
- Hold face through impact (rough wants to close it)
- Target 75-yard swing for 65-yard carry
**Execution Note**: Carried 61 yards, safer than nuking it long

### 75 Yards - Sitting Up in Light Rough

**Club Selection**: Lob wedge (but could also use less loft)
**Strategy**: Land on front edge (68 yards), expect reduced spin
**Lie Reading**: Down-grain grass = better strike, less resistance
**Technique**:
- Neutral swing path (no cut needed)
- Target 70-yard swing
- Plan for slightly less spin due to grass interference
- Deliberately aim for margin of error on short side
**Execution Note**: Carried 73 yards (guessed 72 immediately after contact)

## Tour-Level Insights

### Jim McLean's Practice Drill

**The Immediate Feedback Loop**:
1. Hit the wedge shot
2. Immediately say out loud what distance you think you hit it
3. Check the actual number
4. Repeat process to train feel and calibration

Russell uses this constantly and can predict within 1-2 yards consistently. This drill develops the neural pathway between swing feel and actual distance.

### Reading Pin Positions

**Green Light Pins**: 6+ yards from edge - attack directly
**Yellow Light Pins**: 3 yards from edge - play to fat side or accept lag putt distance
**Strategic Decision Making**: Wind, slope, and lie quality all factor into conservative vs aggressive choice

### Trajectory Philosophy

"I like seeing them kind of flat. I don't like to hit big high spinny wedges. I like kind of flat ones and I know I can hit my number."

- Flatter trajectory = more consistent distance
- High spinny shots are less predictable
- On firm greens, Russell will hit bigger wedge with more spin
- Generally prefers predictable over spectacular

### The Lie Assessment Matrix

**Buried in Rough**: Cut shot, land short, accept conservative result
**Sitting Up in Rough**:
- Down-grain: Normal swing, expect slight distance loss
- Against grain: Potential flyer, use less club
**Fluffy Lie**: Dangerous - can go long with reduced spin

### Common Amateur Mistakes

1. **Too Much Loft**: Pulling lob wedge and hitting it too high
2. **Full Swings**: Trying to make full aggressive swings from 75-100 yards
3. **Ignoring Next Shot**: Not considering putt difficulty when selecting approach shot
4. **Trying to Be Perfect**: Attempting exact yardages instead of owning specific distances
5. **Into the Wind**: Swinging harder instead of using less lofted club
6. **Out of Rough**: Trying to nuke it instead of accepting safe play

## Setup Fundamentals

### Stance
- Slightly narrower than full shots (not quite 50/50 but more narrow)
- Ball position: Feels middle, actually slightly back
- Choke down 1 inch on grip

### Ball Flight Goals
- Neutral to slight draw shape
- Not trying to work the ball significantly
- Focus on consistent strike over shot shape
- Exception: Cut shot from buried rough lies

### Body Motion
- More body rotation, less hand hinge
- "Using my body" feel rather than "hitting with hands"
- Abbreviated follow-through compared to full shots

## Actionable Practice Plan

### Distance Calibration Session

1. Choose your most reliable wedge (start with sand wedge)
2. Hit 10 balls each at these clock positions:
   - 9:00 position (mark average carry)
   - 9:30 position (mark average carry)
   - 10:00 position (mark average carry)
   - 10:30 position (mark average carry)
3. Use Jim McLean drill: Guess distance before checking number
4. Repeat until you can predict within 3 yards consistently
5. Repeat process with gap wedge and lob wedge
6. Create your personal yardage chart in 5-yard increments

### The Less-Loft Drill

1. Find your 80-yard flag
2. Hit 5 balls with your most lofted wedge
3. Hit 5 balls with one club less loft (same controlled swing)
4. Compare: Height, spin, roll-out, consistency of strike
5. Notice which felt more controllable and repeatable

### Trajectory Control Practice

1. Set up at 90 yards
2. Hit 3 balls: Normal height
3. Hit 3 balls: Ball back, flatten trajectory
4. Hit 3 balls: Different wedge, same distance, compare trajectories
5. Develop feel for controlling height independent of distance

## Key Takeaways

1. **Simplify Your System**: Practice in 5-yard increments, not every possible distance
2. **Choke Down Everything**: Creates consistency, better contact, and predictable trajectory
3. **Less Loft is Your Friend**: Use controlled swings with less-lofted clubs for more consistency
4. **Think Beyond the Green**: Where you'll putt from matters more than getting pin-high
5. **Calibrate Your Feel**: Use Jim McLean's immediate feedback drill to train distance awareness
6. **Embrace Flatter Shots**: High spinny wedges look cool but flat penetrating ones score better
7. **Read the Lie First**: Adjust technique and expectations based on grass conditions
8. **Build a Matrix**: Each wedge with 3-4 swings gives you complete yardage coverage
9. **Accept Conservative Plays**: From trouble, a 30-foot chip beats a 50-foot putt past the hole
10. **Practice With Purpose**: Know your exact carry numbers for each swing length

## Tour Pro Wisdom

"I'm not a very technical guy. I don't really understand a lot of the golf swing and how the club works. But I do know that for me choking down, having an abbreviated swing on both sides, and just feeling like I'm using my body simplifies my contact." - Russell Henley

This quote reveals a crucial truth: Elite performance comes from owning a reliable system, not understanding every technical detail. Russell's 5-yard increment approach, combined with his choke-down foundation and less-loft philosophy, creates a repeatable framework that produces tour-level results.
