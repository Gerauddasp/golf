# Video 010: This Drill Feels Wrong…But It Straightens Your Driver

**YouTube ID**: mupl4w6kw9k
**Duration**: 13:25

## Overview

This live lesson addresses one of the most common driver problems: the over-the-top swing path that causes slices, pulls, and inconsistent contact. The student (Chris) had a club path of 5.7° left with scattered strikes all over the face. Through a counterintuitive drill that feels "wrong," the coaches transformed his swing to achieve a club path near 0° (even slightly right), resulting in straight drives and draws carrying 270-275 yards. The key insight: you must feel like you're exaggerating the opposite move to neutralize an ingrained pattern.

## The Problem Diagnosis

### Over-the-Top Pattern
- **Club path**: 5.7° to the left (severe out-to-in)
- **Backswing flaw**: Club travels above the plane on takeaway
- **Shoulder issue**: Shoulders too flat at the top (left shoulder gets too high)
- **Downswing path**: Club returns above plane, cutting across the ball
- **Strike pattern**: Inconsistent contact all over the face (heel, toe, high, low)
- **Spin variation**: Ranged from under 2,000 to over 3,000 RPM
- **Face compensations**: Active release trying to save shots, leading to both pulls and slices

### Why Setup Wasn't the Issue
- Chris's driver setup was "absolute money" from the front view
- Ball position, tee height, and posture were all correct
- Problem was purely in the swing mechanics, not address position

## Key Concepts

### Phase 1: Fix the Backswing

**The Counterintuitive Feel**
- Normal tendency: Club goes above plane, shoulders flatten
- **Required feeling**: Club wraps AROUND the body (feels too flat/inside)
- **Shoulder adjustment**: RIGHT shoulder moves DOWN (steeper shoulder tilt)
- **Critical insight**: "It may have to FEEL as though you're doing that when you hit the shot"

**Why It Feels Wrong**
- The correction feels like an extreme, exaggerated move
- In reality, the exaggerated feeling produces a neutral, on-plane position
- You could do this as a practice swing "for a month" to ingrain the feel

**Visual Reference**
- Use video feedback or alignment aids to see the club on plane
- The feeling is completely opposite to what the video shows
- Trust the feedback, not your ingrained perception

### Phase 2: Fix the Downswing - The Justin Rose Drill

**The Core Movement Pattern**
- Top of backswing → STOP
- **First move**: Shift/bump hips toward target
- **Second move**: Drop arms DOWN (not forward)
- **Key feeling**: Keep back facing target MUCH longer than comfortable
- **Club position**: Club head stays BEHIND hands (under plane)
- **Then rotate**: Body rotation naturally brings club back to plane

**The "Keep Your Back to Target" Drill**
- Swing to top and pause
- Shift hips forward
- Let arms drop while keeping chest/back facing away from target
- Feel like you're trying to get the club past the ball while still facing backward
- This creates the inside-out path naturally

**Why This Works**
- If you don't turn, club path would be 15° right (too much)
- But rotation brings it back to neutral (0-2° right)
- The exaggerated feeling prevents the over-the-top move
- Arms swing, body turns, club slots

### Phase 3: Strike Quality - Toe vs. Heel

**The Toe Contact Solution**
- Chris struggled with persistent heel strikes even with good path
- **Simple fix**: Address the ball at the TOE of the club
- **Mental key**: Actively try to hit the ball off the toe
- **Result**: Ball migrates to center of face

**Why This Works**
- Over-the-top swings often produce heel strikes
- As path improves, heel contact can persist from old habits
- Toe setup compensates for pattern
- Creates proper swing radius and extension

## Actionable Drills

### Drill 1: The Exaggerated Practice Swing

**Purpose**: Reprogram the backswing plane and shoulder tilt

**Setup**:
- Normal driver setup
- Have video feedback or alignment stick showing swing plane

**Execution**:
1. Take practice swing feeling club wraps AROUND body (inside)
2. Feel right shoulder moves DOWN dramatically
3. Check video: club should be on or slightly under plane
4. Repeat this practice swing before EVERY shot
5. Use the exaggerated feeling even when hitting balls

**Success Markers**:
- Club appears on plane in video (even though it feels too flat)
- Shoulders are tilted, not flat
- Left shoulder lower, right shoulder higher at top

**Progression**: Do this as practice swing for weeks/months to ingrain the pattern

### Drill 2: Stop at the Top - Arms Down

**Purpose**: Create proper downswing sequence and inside path

**Setup**:
- Normal driver setup
- Have a coach or training aid for feedback

**Execution**:
1. Swing to top of backswing and STOP
2. Feel your back is still facing target
3. Shift hips/weight toward target
4. Drop arms DOWN toward the ground
5. Keep dropping arms while back stays toward target
6. Eventually rotate but delay it as long as possible
7. Try to get club past ball position while still facing away

**Success Markers**:
- Club head stays behind hands on downswing
- Path moves from left to neutral/right
- Feels extremely uncomfortable initially
- Ball flight changes from slice/pull to straight/draw

**Key Feeling**: "Keep swinging with your arms...keep going...keep going...pass the ball...release the club"

### Drill 3: The 150-Yard Limit Swing

**Purpose**: Ingrain new path without worrying about distance

**Setup**:
- Normal driver setup
- Give yourself permission to swing easy

**Execution**:
1. Use Phase 1 and 2 feelings (backswing plane + arms down)
2. Only try to hit it 150 yards
3. Keep back to target as long as possible
4. Focus on path, not distance

**Success Markers**:
- "150-yard" shots often carry 250+ yards (proving good compression)
- Club path moves toward 0°
- Strike becomes more consistent

**Reality Check**: Chris's "150-yard" attempt carried 256 yards with 0.3° right path

### Drill 4: Start Right, Draw It Back

**Purpose**: Put both fixes together with shot-shaping intent

**Setup**:
- Place alignment stick or club 10-15 yards right of target
- Orange flag/marker at actual target

**Execution**:
1. Use the new backswing feel
2. Use the "keep back to target" downswing
3. Actively try to start ball RIGHT of the stick
4. Let natural draw bring it back to target
5. Don't think about positions—commit to the shot shape

**Success Markers**:
- Ball starts right of intermediate target
- Draws back toward actual target
- Club path consistently 0° to 2° right
- Face slightly closed to path (controlled draw)

**Result**: Chris achieved 2.2° right path with slight draw

### Drill 5: Headcover Inside + Angled

**Purpose**: Prevent heel strikes and guide path

**Setup**:
- Place headcover just outside ball (heel side)
- Angle it slightly to the right (toward target)

**Execution**:
1. Normal swing with all corrections
2. Avoid hitting the headcover
3. Headcover prevents heel contact AND guides path right

**Success Markers**:
- Miss the headcover
- Strike moves toward center/toe
- Path continues to work right

**Advanced Version**: Address ball at TOE, use headcover, hit "toe-side" strikes

### Drill 6: Toe Address Position

**Purpose**: Final fix for persistent heel strikes

**Setup**:
- Set up with ball aligned at TOE of driver
- Feels weird and incorrect

**Execution**:
1. Address ball at toe
2. Make full swing with all corrections
3. Actively TRY to hit it off the toe

**Success Markers**:
- Ball comes out of center of face
- Club path remains neutral
- Distance and spin normalize

**Result**: Chris achieved his best shot (275 yards, 0.6° path, 0.2° face) using this setup

- Shot 6: 1.9° right → Solid
- Final: 0.6° right, face 0.2° → PERFECT (275-yard carry)

## Key Takeaways

1. **The exaggeration principle**: To fix an ingrained pattern, you must feel like you're doing the EXTREME opposite. The exaggerated feeling produces a neutral reality.

2. **Backswing plane is critical**: If the club goes above plane on the way back, it will likely return above plane. Fix takeaway first.

3. **Shoulder tilt matters**: Flat shoulders at top promote over-the-top. Right shoulder DOWN (not around) creates proper tilt.

4. **"Keep your back to target"**: This single thought can transform the downswing sequence. Let the arms drop while delaying rotation.

5. **The Justin Rose drill works**: Pause at top, shift hips, drop arms, keep back facing away, then rotate.

6. **Path fixes come before strike fixes**: Get the path neutral FIRST, then address heel/toe contact.

7. **Toe setup is surprisingly effective**: If heel strikes persist with good path, address the ball at the toe.

8. **Video feedback is essential**: Your feel will be completely wrong initially. Trust the data/video.

9. **Practice swings matter**: Use the exaggerated feeling in practice swings before every shot. It's a rehearsal, not just a warm-up.

10. **Results can be immediate**: Chris went from 5.7° left to 0.6° right in one session—but only because he committed to doing what felt completely wrong.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not exaggerating enough**: If it doesn't feel weird, you're not doing it enough
2. **Rushing the rotation**: Keep back to target longer than comfortable
3. **Lifting arms instead of dropping**: Arms must drop DOWN first
4. **Giving up too soon**: First few shots may feel awful but measurements improve
5. **Ignoring video feedback**: Feel and reality are opposites with swing changes

## Mental Keys

- "It may have to FEEL as though you're doing that when you hit the shot"
- "Keep your back to the target for as long as possible"
- "Keep swinging with your arms...keep going...pass the ball"
- "Sometimes it's just a bit too simple"
- "That's how we want to play golf" (referring to 0.6° path, 0.2° face)

## Equipment Notes

- **Me and My Golf app**: Provides live feedback with swing plane lines (critical for this work)
- **Launch monitor numbers**: Club path, face angle, strike location all matter
- **Video analysis**: Down-the-line view essential for seeing plane
- **Training aids**: Alignment sticks, headcovers, impact spray for strike location
