**YouTube ID**: zLcisJEGmhk
**Duration**: 7:22

## Overview

This video demonstrates how to add significant distance (up to 30 yards) by changing your backswing approach. The lesson focuses on student Michelle, who was taking the club back slow and controlled, which allowed her to hit fairways but robbed her of speed. By implementing two key changes - increasing backswing speed and lengthening the backswing - she gained 10 mph of clubhead speed while maintaining accuracy. The video breaks the common myth that swinging faster and longer causes loss of control, showing that the opposite is often true.

## Key Concepts

### The Problem: Slow, Controlled Backswing

- **Michelle's Issue**: Taking club back very slowly and deliberately
- **Result**: Good accuracy (hitting fairways) but only 71-72 mph clubhead speed
- **Missing Element**: Robbing herself of potential speed and distance
- **Common Misconception**: "I need to be slow and controlled to hit fairways"

### Speed Test Demonstration

- **Slow/Controlled Backswing**: 104 mph clubhead speed (instructor)
- **Fast Backswing**: 110 mph clubhead speed (+6 mph)
- **Fast + Long Backswing**: 116 mph clubhead speed (+12 mph)
- **Key Finding**: More speed in backswing = more speed at impact, without sacrificing accuracy

### Breaking Down the Belief

- **Common Fear**: "Swinging faster and longer will make me lose control"
- **Reality**: Swinging faster and longer often HELPS with control
- **Proof**: Michelle maintained same accuracy with 10 mph more speed
- **Mental Shift**: Speed training doesn't mean sacrificing accuracy

## The Two-Part Solution

### Part 1: Create More Backswing Speed

**The Problem:**
- Taking club back too slow and controlled
- Not creating enough energy in the backswing
- Only using arms/hands instead of full body

**The Martin Borgmire Example:**
- Longest hitters in the world create massive shaft bend on backswing
- This shows they're putting force and impulse into the club handle
- The shaft bends significantly from the speed of the backswing

**The "Standing in the Way" Drill:**
- **Setup**: Instructor stands in the way of the backswing path
- **Execution**: Student tries to take club back but can't move it
- **Purpose**: Feel what muscles should be engaged
- **Key Question**: "Where are you feeling this in your body?"
- **Correct Answer**: Everywhere - hands, core, legs, hips, even feet
- **Result**: Full body awareness and engagement

**The Sledgehammer Analogy:**
- Imagine moving a sledgehammer back
- You can't do it with just hands and arms
- Your whole body must engage to create strength, movement, power, and speed
- Same concept applies to golf club

**Practice Method:**
- Think about "flinging the club back"
- Don't position everything carefully - just MOVE IT FAST
- Use your body to create impulse and energy
- Focus on speed, not control or position
- This is speed training, not swing training

### Part 2: Create More Backswing Length

**The Problem:**
- Short backswing limits distance potential
- Slow backswing naturally results in shorter backswing

**The Solution:**
1. Create speed and energy using the body (Part 1)
2. Allow the arms to go further back
3. Get to the point where you can see the club in corner of your eye (practice swings)

**Important Notes:**
- If you practice overswinging, reality will probably be perfect length
- This applies to DRIVER ONLY
- Slight overswing with driver is fine if you have control
- Think: "If club goes further back, it's like chipping/putting - it will go further"

**Examples:**
- John Rahm and Tony Finau: Known for short swings
- When they hit with longer backswings, ball goes significantly further
- More backswing = more distance (basic physics)

## Actionable Drills

### Drill 1: The Resistance Drill
**Purpose**: Feel full-body engagement in backswing
**Setup**:
- Have partner stand in way of backswing path
- Hold club in normal address position
**Execution**:
- Try to take club back as if making normal backswing
- Partner blocks the club so it can't move
- Focus on what your body is doing
**Success Markers**:
- Feeling tension/activation in hands, core, legs, hips, feet
- Full body stress and engagement
- Understanding that backswing requires whole body, not just arms

### Drill 2: Speed Backswing Practice
**Purpose**: Train faster backswing speed without ball
**Setup**:
- On range or practice area
- No ball initially
**Execution**:
- Make practice backswings
- Think "fling the club back"
- Use body to create impulse
- Don't worry about positions or control
**Success Markers**:
- Club moving noticeably faster
- Body engaging fully
- Feels athletic and dynamic

### Drill 3: Progressive Speed Training
**Purpose**: Build speed while maintaining accuracy
**Setup**:
- Hit 20 drives on range
- MUST be warmed up (using body a lot)
**Execution**:
- First 10 drives: Your normal swing
- Last 10 drives: Fast backswing focus
- Compare accuracy between both sets
**Success Markers**:
- Increased distance on last 10
- Similar or better accuracy on last 10
- Can see/measure speed increase

### Drill 4: Length Extension Practice
**Purpose**: Create longer backswing
**Setup**:
- After mastering speed drill
- Practice swings first
**Execution**:
- Create speed and energy with body (Part 1)
- Allow arms to extend further back
- Try to see club in corner of eye during practice swings
**Success Markers**:
- Longer backswing than normal
- Still feels controlled
- No loss of balance or posture

## Biomechanical Explanation

### Why This Works

**Energy Creation:**
- Backswing speed creates elastic energy in shaft
- Faster backswing = more shaft loading
- More shaft loading = more energy release at impact

**Momentum Transfer:**
- Moving club faster on backswing creates momentum
- That momentum carries through to downswing
- Maintains speed without extra effort on downswing

**Full Body Engagement:**
- Slow backswing often = arm-only movement
- Fast backswing forces body to engage
- More muscle groups = more potential power

**Length = Distance:**
- Longer backswing = longer arc
- Longer arc = more time to accelerate
- More acceleration time = higher speeds

**Efficiency Principle:**
- Slow backswing followed by fast downswing = inefficient (two different tempos)
- Fast backswing followed by fast downswing = efficient (one smooth tempo)
- Less effort required for same or more speed

## Testing Protocol

### How to Test This Yourself

**Without Launch Monitor:**
- Hit 10 drives with normal (slow/controlled) backswing
- Note where they land on range
- Hit 10 drives with fast backswing
- Compare distance visually

**With Launch Monitor:**
- Record baseline clubhead speed (10 swings)
- Record speed with fast backswing (10 swings)
- Look for 5-10 mph increase
- Check dispersion doesn't get worse

**Key Comparisons:**
- Slow + controlled + effort vs. Fast + aggressive + effort
- Must put effort into both to be fair comparison
- Focus on which produces better results for YOU

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not Using Full Body**: Trying to create speed with just arms/hands
2. **Not Warming Up**: This drill uses body extensively - must be warm
3. **Applying to All Clubs**: This is specifically for DRIVER, not irons/wedges
4. **Losing Balance**: Speed should be athletic, not wild
5. **Giving Up Too Soon**: Takes practice to coordinate speed with control
6. **Forgetting to Test**: Must actually measure/observe results, not assume

## Key Takeaways

1. **Slow, controlled backswing robs you of distance** - Even if it feels safer, it limits your potential speed
2. **Create speed IN the backswing, not just downswing** - Think impulse and energy from the start
3. **Use your whole body like moving a sledgehammer** - Not just arms and hands
4. **Longer backswing (with driver) = more distance** - Like chipping and putting, more backswing = more forward swing
5. **Fast and long can IMPROVE control** - Breaks the myth that speed = wild
6. **Test it yourself with 10-shot comparison** - Last 10 drives on range should be high-speed backswings
7. **Speed gains: 6-12 mph possible** - Instructor went from 104 to 116 mph
8. **Must be warmed up** - Using body extensively requires preparation
9. **Practice the feel first** - Resistance drill and practice swings before hitting balls
10. **Accuracy maintained** - Michelle gained 10 mph and hit just as many fairways

## Practice Recommendation

**Next Range Session:**
- Warm up thoroughly (10 minutes minimum)
- Hit first 10 drives with your normal swing
- Hit last 10 drives with fast backswing focus
- Compare distance and accuracy
- Gradually incorporate into regular swing if successful

**Long-term Integration:**
- Start every driver session with 5 fast backswing practice swings
- Use resistance drill occasionally to maintain body awareness
- Monitor speed with launch monitor if available
- Don't sacrifice the gains for perceived control
