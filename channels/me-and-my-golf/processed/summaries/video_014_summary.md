# Video 014: The Secret to Hitting Your Driver Dead Straight

**YouTube ID**: 85wNu1-Ls7o
**Duration**: 10:29

## Overview

This video demonstrates how a single setup change—ball position—can eliminate the two-way miss with the driver and create predictable, straight ball flight. Working with Michael, a 3-handicap golfer struggling with inconsistent driving (missing both left and right), the instructor fixes the problem without making technical swing changes. The lesson shows how moving the ball back in the stance prevents the face from closing too much at impact, then uses swing intention (feeling a fade) to bring the club path back to neutral for dead-straight drives.

The key insight: By adjusting ball position and changing mental intention, you can transform your swing path and face angle without conscious swing mechanics changes.

## Key Concepts

### The Two-Way Miss Problem
- Michael's original issue: Path 5.5° right, attack angle 5.5° up
- Ball position opposite left big toe (very forward)
- Moves away from target in backswing, loading heavily on trail leg
- Club swings underneath the plane on downswing ("stuck")
- Result: Can push right OR hook left—unpredictable

### Ball Position Effect on Face Angle
- **Forward ball position** = hitting late in the arc = more closed face
- Coupled with inside path, face easily shuts down at impact
- With sway away from target + forward ball, creates perfect conditions for hooks
- **Solution**: Move ball back to hit it earlier in the arc

### The Two-Phase Fix

**Phase 1: Move Ball Back (Create Predictable Miss Right)**
- Move ball position from opposite left big toe to inside left foot
- Ball back 3-4 inches from original position
- Initially increases path to the right (6.6° right)
- But prevents face from closing—eliminates left miss
- Creates consistent right miss (predictable is better than two-way)

**Phase 2: Change Swing Intention (Bring It Back to Center)**
- Feel like you're hitting a fade (path left)
- Don't actually want path left—just need to feel it
- The feeling of fade brings path from 7° right down to 2-4° right
- Result: Slight draw path with neutral face = dead straight

### Swing Path vs. Feel
- Michael's feel of "fade" produced 1.8° LEFT path initially (too much)
- Calibrated to feeling fade but with speed = 2.3° right path
- Final result: 1.8° right path with straight ball flight
- **Critical lesson**: What you feel and what actually happens are different

### Lower Body Action (Don't Change This)
- Michael fires hips aggressively (116 mph)
- Squats down, rotates, then jumps through impact
- This is GOOD for power—don't slow it down
- The fix works WITH this move, not against it

### Club Path on Plane
- Before: Club swung "underneath" the swing plane
- After: Club directly on the swing plane line
- Changed by ball position + intention, not by mechanical adjustments
- Backswing identical—only downswing path changed

## Actionable Drills

### Ball Position Diagnostic
**Purpose**: Find if your ball position is causing inconsistency
**Setup**:
- Note your current ball position with driver
- Check if it's opposite or forward of left big toe
- Observe your head movement in backswing (video yourself)
**Execution**:
1. Hit 5 drives with current ball position
2. Note pattern: Both left and right misses? Two-way miss likely
3. Check launch monitor: Path more than 5° right with hooks left? Ball position issue
**Success Markers**: If you have 5° right path but occasionally hook, ball is likely too forward

### Ball Back Progression Drill
**Purpose**: Eliminate the left miss and create predictable ball flight
**Setup**:
- Start with ball opposite left big toe (if that's your current position)
- Have alignment stick on target line for reference
- Launch monitor ideal for feedback
**Execution**:
1. Hit 3 shots with current ball position—note misses
2. Move ball back 2 inches (middle of left foot)—hit 3 shots
3. Move ball back to inside of left foot—hit 3 shots
4. Goal: Find position where you ONLY miss right (if at all)
5. Accept that path will increase to the right initially (6-7°)
6. Be happy when shots start right and stay right
**Success Markers**:
- No more left misses
- Consistent right start line
- Path reads 6-7° right on monitor
- Feel like you "don't have time to clear"

### Fade Feel Drill
**Purpose**: Bring the path back to neutral while maintaining face control
**Setup**:
- Ball in new position (inside left foot)
- Alignment stick on target line
- Launch monitor essential for this drill
**Execution**:
1. From your new ball position, FEEL like you're hitting a fade
2. Try to start the ball LEFT of the target line
3. Swing with intention of path going left
4. Check monitor—you'll likely see 1-2° right path (perfect)
5. First attempts may be too much (2° left path)—that's okay, you found the range
6. Calibrate the feel: Not quite as much "fade feel"
7. Find the feel that produces 2-4° right path
8. Hit 10 balls maintaining this feel
**Success Markers**:
- Path between 1.8° and 2.5° right
- Ball starts on or slightly right of target line
- Controlled draw or straight ball flight
- Carry distance maintained (299+ yards)

### Intention Change Drill (No Mechanical Thoughts)
**Purpose**: Change swing through intention, not mechanics
**Setup**: Use your corrected ball position
**Execution**:
1. Don't think about swing mechanics AT ALL
2. Only think about where you want the ball to START
3. Pick a starting line left of your target
4. Try to start the ball on that line
5. Trust your body to find the path needed
6. Hit 5 balls with this intention
7. Review ball flights—likely much straighter
**Success Markers**:
- You're not thinking about plane, hands, hips, shoulders
- Just thinking about ball flight
- Swing changes automatically
- Straighter, more predictable shots

### Launch Monitor Feedback Loop
**Purpose**: Calibrate feels to actual numbers
**Setup**:
- Launch monitor or TrackMan
- Corrected ball position
- 20+ balls
**Execution**:
1. Hit 5 balls with "normal" feel—note path average
2. Hit 5 balls with "extreme fade" feel—note path (probably left)
3. Hit 5 balls with "moderate fade" feel—note path
4. Find the feel that produces 2-4° right path consistently
5. Lock in that feel with 10 more balls
6. Check: Attack angle should stay 3-5° up, path 2-4° right
**Success Markers**:
- Consistent path numbers (within 1-2° variance)
- Attack angle 3-5° up
- Straight ball flight with slight draw
- No left misses

## Key Takeaways

1. **Ball position is the first domino**: Moving the ball back 3-4 inches eliminated the two-way miss without any swing changes—it prevented the face from closing at the worst possible time

2. **Predictable miss beats two-way miss**: Initially creating a consistent right miss (even if off target) is better than unpredictable left/right misses—you can then calibrate from a predictable baseline

3. **Hit it earlier in the arc**: Ball forward + inside path + face closing = disaster. Ball back = earlier impact = less closed face = no hooks

4. **Feel vs. Real**: Michael had to FEEL like he was hitting a big fade (path left) to actually produce a slight right path—your feels are not reality, and that's okay

5. **Change swing without changing swing**: By changing ball position and intention (not mechanics), the swing path automatically corrected from underneath the plane to on-plane

6. **Don't fix what works**: Michael's aggressive hip action and ground forces create power—the fix worked WITH this strength, not against it

7. **Short-term sacrifice for long-term gain**: Willing to hit it farther right initially (7° path) to eliminate the left miss, then brought it back to center (2° path) through feel changes

8. **Launch monitor is essential**: Without data feedback, you can't calibrate the relationship between feel and reality—practice this with a monitor until the feels are locked in

9. **Lower body speed is an asset**: Fast hips (116 mph) aren't the problem—they're a power source. The issue was club path, not hip speed.

10. **Consistent practice required**: The new feels need repetition with feedback to become automatic—expect to hit 50-100 balls with launch monitor to lock this in
