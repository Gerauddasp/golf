# Video 001: Instantly Straighten YOUR Drives with this Width Drill

**YouTube ID**: jx9AC7NR-bI
**Duration**: 8:48

## Overview

This lesson demonstrates how to fix a weak slice caused by narrow arms at the top of the backswing. Working with a student who had previous back surgery and limited rotation, Me and My Golf show how a simple setup adjustment combined with width in the backswing can instantly transform club path from 4-6 degrees left (over the top) to near-zero or even slightly right. The key discovery: when the body stops rotating early, the arms continue independently, creating a narrow, steep position that forces an over-the-top downswing. The solution involves better rotation through setup changes and conscious width maintenance.

## The Problem Diagnosed

### Student's Swing Pattern
- **Good start**: Nice takeaway, good torso turn, hips rotating well initially
- **Critical breakdown point**: At mid-backswing, rotation stops but arms continue
- **Result at top**:
  - Arms collapsed and narrow
  - Hips already rotated BACK to near 0 degrees before club reaches top
  - Club head miles ahead of hands
  - Very rotated, very narrow position

### Why This Causes a Slice
- Limited rotation + narrow arms = only one place for club to go: OVER THE TOP
- Club path measurements showed 3.1 to 6 degrees left consistently
- Cutting across the ball with an out-to-in path
- Weak slice pattern despite finding the ball

### Root Cause (In This Case)
- Previous back surgery limiting rotation mid-swing
- Body compensating by stopping rotation early
- Arms forced to work independently, getting narrow
- Early hip opening before backswing completes

## The Solution: Setup + Width Focus

### Setup Adjustment - Right Foot Position

**Key Change**: Flare right foot out and pull it back slightly

**Why This Works**:
- Allows deeper hip rotation without strain
- Accommodates physical limitations (back stiffness)
- Creates more rotated, wound-up position naturally
- Keeps hips from opening early

**Coaching Note**: "If we can find a way of creating a setup which allows you to be rotated more, wound up more, deeper with the arms, and wider with the arms, then I'm all in."

### Backswing Feel - Width and Rotation

**Mental Image**:
- "Big wind up and WIDE"
- Club should feel almost vertical at top (student's words)
- Think Nick Faldo's extended arms
- Feel tension in the lats (good tension, not bad)

**Physical Sensation**:
- More tension in lats during backswing
- Maintained width between hands and body
- Legs stay separated (avoid collapse)
- Everything "wound up and in sync"

## The Primary Drill: Stop at the Top

### Drill Execution

**Purpose**: Groove proper width and rotation pattern before adding the downswing

**Setup**:
- Right foot flared and pulled back
- Normal address position otherwise

**Execution**:
1. Take backswing focusing on width and rotation
2. STOP at the top of the backswing
3. Hold position for 1-2 seconds
4. Check position: wide arms, good rotation, club not ahead of hands
5. Then complete the downswing smoothly and patiently

**Success Markers**:
- Arms maintain width at top
- Club face "absolute money" when stopping
- Hips stay deeper (not already opened)
- Legs maintain separation
- Feel like club is more vertical than usual

### Practice Prescription

**Recommendation**:
- 80% of drives you hit should use the stop drill
- Continue this for TWO MONTHS minimum
- Don't rush to hit without stopping

**Progression**:
1. **Phase 1 (Current)**: Stop drill with practice swings - exaggerate the width
2. **Phase 2**: Stop drill with ball - 80% of shots
3. **Phase 3**: "Smooth it all around" - gradually reduce the pause as pattern becomes natural

**Analogy Used**: "We've now drawn the Mona Lisa, but we've done it in dot to dot. We need to now smooth it all around."

## Immediate Results (First Session)

### Club Path Transformation
- **Before**: 4-6 degrees LEFT consistently
- **After**: 1.1 degrees RIGHT on first swing
- **Subsequent shots**: 0.5° left, 1° right, 1.7° right - all near zero

**Path improvement**: 4+ degree shift from just changing the backswing!

### Ball Flight Changes
- Dead straight shots
- Consistent direction (all grouping together)
- Some beautiful high draws appearing
- 240-243 yard carries maintained

### Effort vs. Speed Discovery
- Felt like "half speed" or "half effort" to student
- Actually producing near-full speed
- Much smoother, more patient tempo
- Same or better distance with easier feeling

### Coaching Observation
"You haven't had to think about shallowing. I don't think anyone ever needs to think about shallowing in the golf swing."

## Key Coaching Cues

### Feel Statements
1. "Big wind up and wide"
2. "Smooth and patient in transition"
3. "Good right foot" (reminder about setup)
4. "Really nice rotation on the back swing with width"
5. "Not full speed - just real patient"

### Visual Checkpoints
- Arms wide at top (not narrow)
- Hips deeper, not opened early
- Club not ahead of hands
- Legs maintain separation
- Everything "wound up and in sync"

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Don't let hips rotate back open before reaching top
- Don't allow arms to collapse narrow
- Don't rush the transition after stopping
- Don't let legs collapse together
- Don't think about "shallowing" - it happens naturally from better backswing

## Philosophy & Teaching Points

### Me and My Golf's Approach
1. **Diagnosis first**: Use video/trackman to identify root cause
2. **Work with limitations**: Adapted to student's back issues
3. **Simple solutions**: Changed setup, not complex mechanics
4. **Immediate feedback**: Used launch monitor data to confirm changes
5. **Long-term programming**: Prescribe drill usage for months

### Key Insight
"You've shifted the path four degrees by changing your back swing."

The downswing largely takes care of itself when the backswing creates proper width and rotation. Don't fix the downswing - fix what creates the faulty downswing.

### Context for Different Players
- **If you rotate well naturally**: You might be the "Tasmanian devil of rotation" - need to DELAY rotation, not increase it
- **If you have mobility issues**: Setup adjustments can compensate
- **If you're narrow at top**: Almost always leads to over-the-top

## Practice Integration

### Range Session Structure
1. **Warm up with drill**: 5-10 stop-at-top swings without ball
2. **Hit with drill**: 8 out of 10 drives using stop drill
3. **Monitor feel**: Check for lat tension and width
4. **Track consistency**: Look for path numbers clustering around zero

### On-Course Application
- Use stop drill on range before playing
- Consider using abbreviated stop (mental pause) on course
- Focus on right foot setup and width feel
- Trust that path will be straight if backswing is wide

### Progress Tracking
- Film swing every 2 weeks
- Look for: width at top, hip depth, club head position
- Monitor club path numbers (goal: -1° to +2°)
- Check for consistent ball flight pattern

## Key Takeaways

1. **Narrow arms at top = over the top downswing** - almost guaranteed cause and effect
2. **Setup changes can enable better rotation** - especially with physical limitations
3. **Stop drill programs the pattern** - use it extensively (80% of shots for 2 months)
4. **Width creates proper path** - don't think about shallowing, think about width
5. **Immediate results possible** - student shifted 4+ degrees in first session
6. **Feel vs. reality gap** - "half speed" feel produces full speed reality
7. **The backswing creates the downswing** - fix the source, not the symptom

## Related Concepts

- **Limiting rotation** for players who rotate too much/fast
- **Width maintenance** throughout backswing
- **Hip depth** vs. early opening
- **Stop drill** as programming tool
- **Accommodating physical limitations** through setup
