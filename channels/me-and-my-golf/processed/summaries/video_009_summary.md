## Overview

Early extension is one of the most common swing faults that robs golfers of power, consistency, and solid contact. It occurs when the hips move toward the ball during the downswing, causing the golfer to lift out of their posture. This video presents three surprising fixes that address the root causes of early extension: improper setup posture, arms too upright in the backswing, and lack of space awareness through impact. The instructors demonstrate that by fixing these three areas, golfers can dramatically reduce or eliminate early extension without having to consciously think about keeping their butt back during the swing.

## Key Concepts

### What is Early Extension?

- **Definition**: When you draw a line down behind the butt at address, early extension is moving away from that line and getting closer to the golf ball
- **Common result**: Lifting up out of posture during the downswing
- **Consequences**:
  - Inconsistent strike quality
  - Loss of directional control
  - Significant power loss
- **Multiple causes**: Can be physical limitations, but most often caused by setup and swing mechanics

### The Root Cause Chain

- **Steep downswing → Early extension compensation**: If the club approaches too steep or over-the-top, golfers instinctively thrust their hips forward and rise up to shallow out the club path
- **Without compensation**: Keeping the butt back with a steep approach causes even steeper contact, possible misses, and severe pull patterns
- **The solution**: Fix the causes (setup, backswing) rather than fighting the symptom (early extension) in the downswing

## Fix #1: Setup Posture - The Foundation

### The Problem: Poor Hip-Ankle Alignment

- **Common mistake**: Butt positioned too far behind the heels at setup
- **Why it causes early extension**: Creates an off-balance position that the body subconsciously tries to correct during the swing
- **Case study - Devon**: Student had butt well behind heels with over-bent legs, resulting in 5-6 inches of early extension
- **Simple fix result**: Changed only posture, almost completely eliminated early extension

### Correct Posture Setup

**Hip-Ankle Alignment**:
- Hips should be positioned directly over the ankle joint
- Start from tall posture, hinge forward from hip joint with neutral spine
- Soften the legs (don't over-bend)
- Weight should feel through the middle of the feet, right through the arches
- NOT on heels, NOT on toes

**The Line Check**:
- Draw a line behind the butt at setup
- Should be roughly one club head width behind the heel line
- If butt is multiple club heads back, you're too far out of balance

**Common Setup Error**:
- Over-bending the legs pushes butt too far back
- Creates excessive knee flex and hip angle
- Body will subconsciously seek balance by moving forward in downswing

### Distance from Ball - The Tricep Line Test

**Critical checkpoint for preventing early extension**:

**The Test**:
- Draw a vertical line down the back of the tricep at address
- Should run slightly in front of the knees
- Should pass through the base of the toes

**Too far from ball**:
- Creates huge gap between arms and body
- Forces body to move into that gap during swing
- Results in immediate early extension to reach the ball
- Balance destroyed, strikes suffer, power lost

**Why this matters**: "This is probably the most important part" - proper distance from the ball allows you to maintain body angles throughout the swing

## Fix #2: Arm Depth in Backswing - Prevent Steep Downswing

### Understanding Arm Depth

**The Concept**:
- "Arm depth" refers to how much the arms wrap around the body in the backswing
- Too upright = arms lift up rather than turn around
- Proper depth = left arm works more around the body

**Why it prevents early extension**:
- Arms too upright → steep downswing plane → forced to early extend to shallow club
- Arms with depth → shallower downswing plane → can rotate without thrusting forward

### The Checkpoint: Club Butt Line at Top

**At top of backswing**:
- Draw a line down the butt end of the club
- Should point somewhere toward the heel line
- Too far in front of toe line = arms too upright, will cause steep downswing

**The cause and effect**:
- Upright arms = steep start to downswing
- Then must "play catchup" by thrusting hips forward to shallow the club
- With proper depth = club already on plane, no compensation needed

### The Visual Drill: Club on Ground at 30-40°

**Setup**:
- Place a club on the ground just in front of your foot
- Angle it between 30-40 degrees
- This becomes your visual reference

**The Test**:
- **Arms too upright**: Cannot see the club on ground - would have to put head between arms to see it
- **Proper arm depth**: Can clearly see the club above your arm at top of backswing

**How to practice**:
1. Set up with reference club on ground
2. Make backswing to top
3. Check if you can see the club above your arm (use peripheral vision)
4. If you can see it clearly, arms are in great position
5. Hit shots while maintaining this visual checkpoint

**Success markers**:
- Club visible above arm throughout backswing
- Don't need to look - can see it with peripheral vision
- When you can do this, club will shallow naturally in downswing
- No need to thrust forward with hips

## Fix #3: The Close-Standing Drill - Force Space Creation

### The Concept: Reverse the Feeling

**Problem**: Early extension = moving toward the ball
**Solution**: Train the opposite feeling = moving away from the ball

**The drill principle**: "It's almost going to force you to move this way" - creates the correct movement pattern by necessity

### How to Execute the Drill

**Setup**:
- Move approximately 2 inches closer to the ball than normal
- "Way too close for me to actually comfortably strike the golf ball"
- This is intentionally uncomfortably close

**What happens**:
- In order to make solid contact, you MUST create space
- Must move butt away from the ball (opposite of early extension)
- Forces proper rotation and maintaining spine angle

**Real-world example**:
- John Ram stands super close at address, then creates space
- Best players move back and rotate properly
- This drill trains that same movement pattern

### Practice Protocol

**On the range**:
- "Torture it in practice" - practice standing uncomfortably close
- Forces the correct movement because shanks will occur otherwise
- Immediate feedback: forward thrust = shank, space creation = solid contact

**On the course**:
- Don't need to stand this close during actual play
- The drill creates the proper feeling and movement pattern
- Transfer that feeling to normal setup distance

**Why it works**:
- "It's a forcer" - physically impossible to hit it well without correct movement
- If you thrust forward from that position, guaranteed shank
- Body learns the correct pattern through necessity

## Actionable Drills

### Drill 1: Posture Setup Routine

**Purpose**: Establish proper hip-ankle alignment and prevent setup-induced early extension

**Setup**:
1. Stand tall with neutral spine
2. Hinge forward from hip joint (not waist)
3. Soften legs slightly - don't over-bend
4. Check weight: should feel through middle of feet/arches

**Execution**:
1. Have someone draw a line or place club behind your butt
2. Check distance behind heels - should be about one club head width
3. Check tricep line - draw line down back of tricep
4. Should pass slightly in front of knees and through base of toes

**Success Markers**:
- Hips over ankles
- Weight balanced through middle of feet
- Arms hanging naturally, not reaching
- Feel athletic and balanced, not reaching or stretched

### Drill 2: Arm Depth Visual Reference

**Purpose**: Train proper arm depth in backswing to prevent steep downswing

**Setup**:
1. Place alignment stick or club on ground just in front of foot
2. Angle at 30-40 degrees away from target line
3. Get into normal address position

**Execution**:
1. Make slow backswing to top
2. At top, check if you can see the club on ground above your arm
3. If you can't see it, you're too upright - get arms more around body
4. Practice until you can consistently see the club at top
5. Progress to hitting shots while maintaining this checkpoint

**Success Markers**:
- Club clearly visible above left arm at top of backswing
- Can see it with peripheral vision while looking at ball
- Downswing feels shallower, more on plane
- Less tendency to thrust hips forward

### Drill 3: Close-Standing Space Creation

**Purpose**: Force the body to move away from ball (opposite of early extension)

**Setup**:
1. Move 2 inches closer to ball than normal
2. Should feel uncomfortably close
3. Normal grip and posture otherwise

**Execution**:
1. Make normal backswing
2. On downswing, focus on creating space to avoid shanking
3. Must move butt back and rotate to find center of clubface
4. Hit shots accepting that contact won't be perfect initially
5. Repeat 10-15 balls

**Success Markers**:
- Solid contact from closer position (not shanks)
- Feel of moving away from ball through impact
- Sense of creating space rather than moving into space
- Transfer this feeling to normal setup distance afterward

**Practice frequency**: "Torture it in practice" - use this drill regularly on range, not needed on course

## Key Takeaways

1. **Setup is paramount**: "This is probably the most important part" - proper posture with hips over ankles eliminates most early extension before the swing even starts

2. **Fix causes, not symptoms**: Don't try to consciously keep your butt back during the swing. Fix setup posture and backswing plane instead

3. **Arm depth prevents steep downswing**: Getting arms more around the body in backswing prevents the steep approach that causes early extension compensation

4. **The tricep-line distance test**: A vertical line down the back of your tricep should pass slightly in front of knees and through base of toes - critical for proper distance from ball

5. **Train the opposite feeling**: Use the close-standing drill to force your body to move away from the ball rather than toward it

6. **Case study success**: Student Devon's early extension almost completely disappeared by changing only his setup posture - more upright, less knee bend, hips closer to over ankles

7. **Physical limitations exist**: Some early extension can be due to physical restrictions, but most golfers have setup and swing plane issues first

8. **The steep-to-shallow compensation**: Understanding that early extension is often a compensation for a too-steep downswing helps you address the root cause

## Related Concepts

- **Balance and weight distribution**: Proper setup ensures weight through middle of feet, not heels or toes
- **Swing plane fundamentals**: Shallower backswing (arm depth) leads to shallower downswing
- **Body rotation mechanics**: Proper posture allows full rotation without compensation
- **Space management**: Understanding when to create space (downswing) vs. when to maintain positions (setup)

## Implementation Sequence

1. **First**: Check and correct your setup posture (hips over ankles, proper knee flex)
2. **Second**: Check your distance from ball using tricep-line test
3. **Third**: Work on arm depth in backswing using ground club visual drill
4. **Fourth**: Use close-standing drill on range to reinforce moving away from ball
5. **Result**: Early extension should significantly reduce or disappear without conscious effort to keep butt back during swing
