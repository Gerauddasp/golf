# Video 005: The Driver Drill That Finally Fixed an Over The Top Swing

**YouTube ID**: jOH7sofDhYA
**Duration**: 5:22

## Overview

This video presents a breakthrough combination drill that fixes the classic over-the-top slice pattern by addressing both club path and face angle simultaneously. The instructor shares a real lesson where he experimentally combined two proven drills - the "Drag and Push" for path correction and the "Toe into the Bag" for face closure - with astounding results. This innovative approach tackles the two-part problem that causes inconsistent drives: a club path that's too far left (5-10° left) and an open clubface that's inconsistent.

The key insight is that many inconsistent drivers actually have a consistent club path problem - it's the face presentation that varies, causing slices 80% of the time (face open) and pulls 20% of the time (face square or closed).

## Key Concepts

### Understanding the Over-the-Top Slice Pattern

- **Club Path**: Typically 5-10° left (over the top)
- **Face Angle**: Open 80% of the time = slice; square/closed 20% of the time = pull left
- **The Inconsistency Myth**: You're not inconsistent - your path is consistent (left), but your face presentation varies
- **Ball Flight Laws**: Path left + Face open = slice right; Path left + Face square/closed = pull left

### The Drag and Push Drill (Path Correction)

- **Purpose**: Shifts club path from left to right, fixing the over-the-top move
- **Setup**: Normal driver setup with full backswing loading into trail leg
- **Key Position**: At top of backswing, place clubhead on ground behind heels (minimal arm action)
- **Execution**: Move toward target (lateral + rotation) while dragging club on ground
- **Result**: Club path moves dramatically to the right (demonstrated: 5.2° right vs. normal 1-2° left)
- **Bonus Effect**: Promotes hitting up on the ball (positive angle of attack)

### The Problem with Path-Only Fix

- **Andrea's Experience**: Path improved (went right), but shots got WORSE
- **The Reason**: Path went right, but face stayed open (1° open to path)
- **Ball Flight**: Push right or push-fade - not functional golf shots
- **Lesson**: Fixing path alone isn't enough - must also square the face

### The Toe into the Bag Drill (Face Closure)

- **Purpose**: Aggressively closes the clubface through impact
- **Equipment**: Impact bag positioned in front
- **Setup**: Mini swings only (full swings risk injury)
- **Execution**: Drive the toe of the club into the bag, rotating it closed
- **Feel**: Like an aggressive forehand topspin tennis ground stroke
- **Effect**: "Adrenaline shot of face closure"

## Actionable Drill

### The Combined Drag-Push-Toe Drill (EXPERIMENTAL)

**Purpose**: Simultaneously fix club path (too left) and face angle (too open) for over-the-top slicers

**Equipment Needed**:
- Driver
- Impact bag

**Setup**:
1. Place impact bag in impact position
2. Normal driver address position
3. Take full backswing loading into trail leg

**Execution**:
1. **Drag Phase**: From top of backswing, place club on ground behind heels
2. **Push Phase**: Move toward target (lateral + rotation) dragging club on ground
3. **Toe Phase**: Aggressively drive toe of club into impact bag, rotating it closed
4. **Feel**: Like flipping the bag over with aggressive rotation - similar to tennis forehand topspin

**Success Markers**:
- Club path shifts from left to right (5-10° change)
- Face aggressively closes through impact (several degrees closed to path)
- Impact bag flips/rotates from the aggressive toe rotation
- Balls start right of target and draw back (for severe slicers)

**Important Warnings**:
- Start with mini/half swings - full swings can cause injury with bag
- Be aware this is an exaggerated correction drill
- May produce hooks if you don't already have face control issues
- Monitor your results - this drill is POWERFUL

**Real Results**:
- Andrea's path: Went from 5-10° left to right
- Face: Went from open to closed
- Ball flight: Transformed from slice to functional draw
- Instructor's demo: Path 3.3° right, face 5.6° LEFT of that (dramatic closure)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Inconsistent drives aren't about inconsistency** - you likely have a consistent path problem (too left) with variable face presentation
2. **Fixing path alone can make shots worse** - if you shift path right but keep the face open, you'll push everything right
3. **The two-part solution**: Must fix BOTH path (drag and push) AND face (toe into bag) simultaneously
4. **The Drag-Push-Toe drill is a game-changer** for over-the-top slicers - it addresses both problems in one movement
5. **This is a correction drill** - extremely powerful for slicers, but will produce hooks for players who already close the face well
6. **Start conservatively** - use mini swings with the bag, build up gradually, monitor your ball flight
7. **The feel is aggressive** - like flipping an impact bag with topspin rotation, not a gentle movement
8. **Expect dramatic changes** - this drill can shift path 8-10° and close face 5-7° in a single session

## Instructor Notes

This was the first time the instructor combined these two drills, described as an "experiment" during Andrea's lesson. The results were so impressive that he plans to use this drill combination regularly going forward. The instructor emphasizes being aware of when you use this drill and monitoring results, as it's an extremely powerful correction tool that may not be appropriate for all swing types.
