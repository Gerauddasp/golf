# Video 007: Hit Your Driver Straight (Fix Your Club-Face Today)

**YouTube ID**: b4GyyCQUBjc
**Duration**: 12:03

## Overview

This lesson features a student (Devin, 22 handicap) struggling with slices, pulls, and topped shots with the driver. The instructors diagnose two primary issues: (1) improper ball position and spine tilt causing an iron setup instead of a driver setup, and (2) early extension from poor posture leading to heel strikes. By fixing these setup fundamentals and teaching the student to close the clubface through impact, they achieve immediate improvement with straighter, longer drives.

The lesson emphasizes that driver is a "specialist club" requiring different setup positions than irons, and demonstrates how posture directly impacts strike quality and clubface control.

## Key Concepts

### Driver as a Specialist Club

- **Ball Position**: Must be opposite the left heel (for right-handed golfer), NOT in the middle stance like an iron
- **Spine Tilt**: Need right shoulder lower than left, creating tilt away from target
- **Contact Point**: Hitting ball on the upswing for maximum launch and power
- **Why It Matters**: Ball position affects when the clubface squares during the swing arc

### Early Extension (The Major Fault)

- **Definition**: Losing space between your backside and an imaginary vertical line behind you during the downswing
- **Cause**: Poor setup posture with too much weight on heels, butt pushed too far back
- **Effect**:
  - Moves you closer to the ball during downswing
  - Causes heel strikes (5-6 inches of forward movement observed)
  - Results in pulls (ball starts left) and slices (ball curves right)
  - Loss of power and consistency

### Proper Driver Posture

- **Hip Position**: Hips should be more over the ankles, not way behind them
- **Leg Activation**: Feel taller and more upright in the legs
- **Weight Distribution**: Weight through middle of feet, NOT on heels
- **Balance Test**: Should be able to resist being pushed backward
- **Feel**: More athletic, activated, stronger position

### The "Heel vs. Toe" Race Concept

- **Problem**: When slicing, the heel of the club is "winning the race" back to the ball
- **Result**: Clubface arrives at impact open (pointing right)
- **Path vs. Face**: Student's path was 2.3° left, but face was open, causing slice
- **Solution**: Get the toe to "win the race" - let the toe rotate ahead of the heel through impact
- **Key Feel**: Soften hands, allow (don't force) the clubface to close

## Actionable Drills

### Drill 1: Ball Position Check

**Purpose**: Establish proper driver ball position for better face squaring
**Setup**:
- Place alignment stick or club on ground parallel to target line
- Position ball opposite left heel (not center of stance)
**Execution**:
1. Set up with ball in old position (center/slightly forward)
2. Make slow swing - notice clubface points right at impact zone
3. Move ball to left heel position
4. Make slow swing - notice clubface has more time to square
5. Observe how the face naturally closes as club moves forward
**Success Markers**:
- Ball feels "way out front" initially (this is correct)
- Setup looks like driver setup, not iron setup
- Shots start more left of target rather than straight/right

### Drill 2: Posture and Balance Foundation

**Purpose**: Eliminate early extension by establishing proper setup posture
**Setup**:
- Have someone place a club/stick vertically just behind your butt at address
- Mark this reference line
**Execution**:
1. Set up in your normal posture
2. Check the "daylight" between your butt and the line
3. Adjust: bring hips forward over ankles, stand taller
4. Feel weight move from heels to middle of feet
5. Have partner push you backward - should be difficult to move
6. Make swings maintaining this posture - minimize space between you and reference line
**Success Markers**:
- Feel more upright, taller in setup
- Legs feel more activated/engaged
- Only 1-2 inches behind reference line (not 5-6 inches)
- Consistent center-face strikes (not heel strikes)
- No pulls during practice

### Drill 3: "Toe Wins the Race" Impact Drill

**Purpose**: Close the clubface through impact to eliminate slice
**Setup**:
- Place impact bag or cushion in front of ball position
- Position it where ball would be at impact
**Execution**:
1. Set up to ball with proper posture and ball position
2. Soften your hands and grip pressure
3. Make slow-motion swings focusing on rotating the toe into the bag
4. Feel: Don't try to force it - LET it happen
5. Gradually increase speed while maintaining toe rotation
6. The toe should reach the bag before the heel
**Success Markers**:
- Toe of club visibly rotates closed through impact zone
- Clubface pointing left of target at follow-through
- Ball flight is straight or slight draw (not slice)
- Thought: "Allow" the clubface to close, don't force it

### Drill 4: Consistency Building (Rep Work)

**Purpose**: Ingrain the new posture and strike pattern
**Setup**:
- Use all three previous setup corrections together
- Ball forward, posture tall and balanced, soft hands
**Execution**:
1. Hit multiple drivers focusing only on consistency of setup
2. Goal: Make the same swing repeatedly, even if still slicing initially
3. Monitor strike location on clubface
4. Once consistent with new posture, add toe-wins-race feel
5. Build 10-15 consecutive swings with same ball flight
**Success Markers**:
- Repetitive ball flights (not random)
- Center-face or toe strikes (not heel)
- No pulls (indicates good posture)
- Pattern is fixable (predictable slice better than random misses)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Driver Setup is Different**: Ball forward (left heel), spine tilted right, not an iron setup
2. **Early Extension Causes Heel Strikes**: Poor posture (weight on heels, butt back) creates forward movement through impact
3. **Proper Posture = Athletic and Balanced**: Hips over ankles, weight in middle of feet, can't be pushed backward easily
4. **The Clubface Closes Throughout the Swing**: Ball position forward gives more time for face to square naturally
5. **"Heel vs. Toe Race" for Slicers**: If slicing, your heel is winning - need to let the toe win by softening hands and allowing rotation
6. **Path vs. Face Understanding**: You can swing left (good) but still slice if face is open relative to path
7. **Consistency Before Perfection**: Repeatable misses are easier to fix than random shots
8. **Posture Fixes Strike Quality**: Better posture immediately improved strike location from heel to center/toe
9. **Feel vs. Real**: "Feels way out front" is actually correct ball position for driver
10. **Immediate Results Possible**: Student went from big slices to fairway-finding drives in one session with these fundamentals

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Ball Too Far Back**: Creates iron setup, face arrives open, promotes slice
- **Spine Vertical**: No tilt means you're not set up to hit up on the ball
- **Weight on Heels**: Leads to early extension and forward movement
- **Butt Too Far Back**: Creates imbalance and forces early extension
- **Trying to Force Face Closed**: Tension in hands prevents natural rotation
- **Aiming Left to Compensate**: This compounds problems rather than fixing root cause
- **Focusing on Swing Before Setup**: Fix setup first - many swing issues disappear

## Related Concepts

- **Face-to-Path Relationship**: Determines ball curvature (even with left path, open face = slice)
- **Dynamic Balance**: Maintaining posture angles throughout the swing
- **Specialist Club Philosophy**: Driver requires unique setup compared to irons
- **Launch Conditions**: Hitting up on driver vs. hitting down on irons
- **Strike Location Impact**: Heel strikes lose speed and start left regardless of face angle

## Practice Sequence Recommendation

**Week 1-2**: Focus exclusively on setup (ball position, posture, balance)
**Week 3-4**: Add toe-wins-race feel once setup is consistent
**Week 5+**: Build repetitions with full integration, monitor strike location

**On-Course**: Return to these fundamentals if slice reappears - likely a setup reversion
