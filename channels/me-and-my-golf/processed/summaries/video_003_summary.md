# Video 003: The Arm Move You Need To Strike Ball Then Turf

**YouTube ID**: gflOK1iJm5c
**Duration**: 8:48

## Overview

This lesson features a live coaching session with Dan, who struggles with inconsistent iron striking—frequently hitting shots fat or thin despite having good power. The instructor identifies a critical arm movement flaw: the "chicken wing" (left arm bending and flaring out through impact). This causes the swing radius to shorten, forcing the head and body to drop to compensate and reach the ball. The solution is the "Set to Point" drill, which teaches proper arm extension through impact. Dan sees immediate, dramatic improvement in ball-first contact within the same session.

## Key Concepts

### The Root Cause: Chicken Wing + Head Drop

**What's Actually Happening:**
- Dan's body movement is excellent (good hip shift, reaching impact line early)
- BUT his elbows flare apart through impact (chicken wing pattern)
- When elbows separate, the swing radius decreases
- To compensate for shorter radius, head drops 2+ inches in downswing
- This creates inconsistent contact—sometimes fat, sometimes thin

**Critical Insight:**
- It's a chicken-and-egg problem: Is the head drop causing the arm issue, OR are the arms causing the head drop?
- Physical screening ruled out mobility limitations (90/90 test, lat length test both passed)
- Conclusion: It's a swing pattern issue, not a physical restriction

### The Impact Line Concept

**What It Is:**
- The yellow line marking where the body should be at impact
- Getting to this line = good weight shift and proper sequencing

**Dan's Pattern:**
- Reaches impact line EARLY (which is good)
- Good hip rotation and shoulder movement
- But then compensates with head drop to make up for shortened arm radius

### Swing Radius and Arm Extension

**The Physics:**
- Elbows close together = longer swing radius
- Elbows flaring apart = shorter swing radius (club pulls into body)
- Ball is a fixed distance from your body
- If radius shortens, something must compensate (usually head/body drops)

**Comparison Analysis:**
- FAT SHOT: Head drops significantly, elbows flare wide
- PURE SHOT: Head drops 1-2 inches less, elbows stay closer together
- Even this small difference (2 inches) makes huge impact on strike quality

## Actionable Drills

### Set to Point Drill (Primary Fix)

**Purpose**:
Teaches proper arm extension through impact and eliminates chicken wing pattern

**Setup**:
- Use a tee to encourage focusing on movement, not strike quality
- Start with 7-iron or similar mid-iron
- Think "low punch shot" or "hitting under tree branches"

**Execution**:
1. Take a SHORT backswing (about waist height)
2. Focus intensely on keeping elbows CLOSE TOGETHER through swing
3. Swing through with SHORT follow-through (stop at waist height on follow-through)
4. Feel like you're SQUEEZING elbows together through impact
5. Keep body rotation active (don't just move arms)
6. Maintain club speed—this isn't a slow-motion drill

**Key Feels:**
- "Squeeze elbows together" through the hitting area
- Arms extending DOWN the target line
- Low, punchy finish (like hitting under branches)
- Body still rotating fully through

**Success Markers:**
- Tee still in ground after shot
- Divot starts AFTER ball position (1 inch after)
- Crisp, compressed contact sound
- Ball flight will be lower than normal (this is correct)
- Distance: Expect 120-130 yards with this abbreviated swing

**Common Concern Addressed:**
- "Won't I hit it fat if I extend arms while head still drops?"
- Answer: Initially you MIGHT hit a few fat, but this is the pattern correction
- The head drop is a COMPENSATION for shortened arms
- Once arms extend properly, head will naturally stop dropping as much
- Don't judge the drill after 3 shots—give it 10-15 swings to adapt

### Practice Swing Progression

**Step 1: No Ball**
- Make mini backswing, stop
- Swing through to mini follow-through, HOLD finish position
- Check elbow gap visually—should be close together
- Repeat 5-10 times to groove the feel

**Step 2: With Tee**
- Same motion, now with teed ball
- Focus on MOVEMENT QUALITY over result
- May produce lower ball flight (this is correct for drill)

**Step 3: Progressive Distance**
- Once consistent contact achieved, gradually lengthen swing
- Always maintain the "squeeze elbows" feel
- Don't rush to full swing—better to master the feel at 75% first

## Video Analysis Checkpoints

### Front-On View

**What to Check:**
1. **Elbow Gap**: Measure distance between elbows at address vs. impact
   - FAULT: Gap widens significantly
   - CORRECT: Gap stays same or narrows slightly

2. **Head Height**: Track vertical head movement in downswing
   - FAULT: Drops 3+ inches
   - IMPROVED: Drops only 1 inch or maintains height

3. **Impact Line**: Hips/shoulders relative to setup position
   - Dan already does this well—reaching line early

### Down-The-Line View

**What to Check:**
1. **Left Arm Position**: Should extend down target line
   - FAULT: Bends and pulls across body (chicken wing)
   - CORRECT: Stays extended and straight through impact

2. **Swing Plane**: Club path through hitting area
   - Dan's plane is already excellent
   - Maintain this while fixing arm extension

3. **Body Height**: Overall posture through impact
   - FAULT: Significant dropping/diving
   - IMPROVED: More stable, less vertical drop

## Key Takeaways

1. **Ball-first contact requires arm extension** - The "chicken wing" is a strike killer because it shortens your swing radius

2. **Head drop is often a compensation** - If your arms don't extend, your body must drop to reach the ball. Fix the arms first.

3. **The Set to Point drill works IMMEDIATELY** - Dan went from inconsistent contact to pure strikes with divot after ball in the same session

4. **Expect some initial fat shots** - When you first extend arms while body still wants to drop, you may hit behind ball. This is temporary during pattern change.

5. **Keep body rotation active** - This isn't an "arms-only" swing. Body still rotates fully; arms just need to extend properly.

6. **Physical limitations aren't always the cause** - If you pass basic mobility tests, the issue is likely swing pattern, not flexibility

7. **Small changes = big results** - Just 2 inches less head drop makes the difference between fat shots and pure contact

8. **The drill creates a "low punch" shot** - Don't expect full distance or high ball flight. Focus is on strike quality and pattern correction.

## Real-World Application

**On the Range:**
- Start every session with 10-15 Set to Point swings
- Use a tee even with irons to remove strike anxiety
- Progress to turf only after consistent tee contact

**Course Management:**
- Low punch shot learned in drill is valuable for windy conditions
- Perfect for Scottish-style firm courses
- Useful for hitting under tree branches (as drill visualizes)

**Pattern Recognition:**
- If you hit fat shots, check: Are your elbows flaring?
- If you hit thin shots, same question: Elbows separating?
- Video yourself front-on to see elbow gap clearly

**Progressive Training:**
- Week 1: Set to Point drill only (shortened swing)
- Week 2: Gradually lengthen backswing while maintaining feel
- Week 3: Implement into full swing
- Week 4+: Make it subconscious through repetition

*This lesson demonstrates that sometimes the most obvious fault (head dropping) is actually a symptom of a deeper issue (arm extension). Always look for the root cause, not just the visible effect.*
