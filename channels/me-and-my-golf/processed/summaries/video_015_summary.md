# Video 015: The Secret to Hitting Your Driver Dead Straight

**YouTube ID**: n09ULTsRAWg
**Duration**: 13:14

## Overview

This live lesson features Nate, a 3-handicap golfer who occasionally hooks his driver (2-3 hooks per 14 drives). The instructors take a unique approach by ignoring setup and backswing issues entirely, focusing exclusively on the through-swing and finish position. The problem: Nate's club was traveling 5° out to the right with a high, extended finish (literally hitting ceilings in his brother's simulator). The solution: A lower, more rotational finish that brought his club path from 5° right down to near 0° - dead straight. The dramatic results came from one simple feel: finishing with hands lower and more around the body.

## Key Concepts

### The Root Problem: Over-Extension Through Impact

**Original Swing Pattern**:
- Club head gets behind hands on downswing (underneath plane)
- Club approaches ball from inside with 5° right path
- After impact, club extends dramatically away from body
- Finish position extremely high (hitting simulator ceiling, cell phone in back pocket)
- Arms fully extended and disconnected from body rotation

**Why This Causes Hooks**:
- 5° right club path + closed face = hook spin
- Extended, high finish allows hands to become active
- Club travels "out" rather than "around" through impact

### The Colin Morikawa Principle

**Simple Finish Feel Controls Everything**:
- Colin Morikawa's approach: "If I want to play a draw, I'll finish high. If I want to play a fade, I'll finish low"
- This one simple cue organizes the entire through-swing
- The finish position you target dictates the path that precedes it

**Modern vs Old School Finishes**:
- Old school: High, fully extended arms
- Modern (JJ Spaun, Colin Morikawa): Lower, more rotational finish
- Low/left finish makes it very hard to get active with hands (reduces hooks)

### The Alignment Stick Drill

**Purpose**: Create physical constraint forcing more rotational finish

**Setup**:
1. Place alignment stick in ground at driver shaft angle at address
2. Position stick just outside through-swing path
3. Stick acts as "ceiling" preventing high finish

**Execution**:
- Start with no backswing - just go to impact position
- Swing club "around" body rather than "out" toward target
- Feel hands finishing lower and more left
- Key sensation: Hands tracing around rather than extending away

**Progression**:
1. No backswing, just through-swing rehearsals
2. Halfway backswing, focus on finish
3. "Chip" swings (50 yards) maintaining lower finish
4. 70% effort (220 yards)
5. Full speed, maintaining the feel

### JJ Spaun Comparison

**Why This Finish Works**:
- Spaun's finish is notably low and left
- Me and My Golf instructors observed him at US Open range
- When finish is low and left, it's "very hard to get active with the hands"
- Prevents the high, extended follow-through that allows hooks
- Southern California connection (both Spaun and Morikawa)

### The "Fade Feel" for Straight Shots

**Paradoxical but Effective**:
- Nate was told to feel like hitting a fade
- Feel: Finish lower, more around body
- Result: Dead straight shots (0.2° club path)

**Why It Works**:
- Previous pattern was 5° right path (inside-out)
- "Fade feel" neutralized the excessive inside-out path
- Brought path to neutral (0-1° right)
- With square face, this produces straight shots

## Actionable Drills

### The No-Backswing Through-Swing Drill

**Purpose**: Isolate and train the correct through-swing without backswing interference

**Setup**:
- Address ball normally with driver
- No alignment stick needed for practice (but helpful initially)

**Execution**:
1. Take address position
2. Lift club slightly off ground (hover)
3. Move into impact position with body rotation
4. From impact, swing club "around" body to finish
5. Focus: Hands finishing lower and more left
6. Complete the finish fully - don't abbreviate

**Success Markers**:
- Hands finish below shoulder height (not above head)
- Finish position more rotational, less linear
- Club wraps around body rather than extending away
- Feel like you're making a fade swing (even for straight shots)

**Progression**:
- 10-15 rehearsals with no ball
- Hit foam balls or into net
- Gradually add backswing once feel is established

### The Chip-Swing Integration Drill

**Purpose**: Bridge gap between rehearsal and full swing with lower finish

**Setup**: Normal driver setup on range

**Execution**:
1. Take mini backswing (halfway or less)
2. Make full through-swing with proper finish
3. Goal: 50-70 yards carry (not distance)
4. Focus entirely on finish position, ignore result
5. Can "miss it, top it, hook it, slice it" - just get the move

**Success Markers**:
- Club path improves from 5° right to 0-1° right
- Finish feels dramatically lower
- More body rotation, less arm extension
- No sensation of "reaching" or "pushing" through ball

**Key Insight**:
- First chip swing brought Nate's path from 5° to 0.3° right
- This proved the concept before adding speed

### The 70% Power Drill

**Purpose**: Add speed while maintaining new finish pattern

**Setup**: Full driver setup, tee height normal

**Execution**:
1. Take full backswing
2. Swing at 70% perceived effort
3. Target: 220 yards (not your normal 260+)
4. Maintain lower finish feel throughout
5. "Fade thought" in mind

**Success Markers**:
- Club path stays 0-2° right (vs old 5° right)
- Ball flight straight or slight fade
- Finish position remains low and rotational
- No sensation of hitting ceiling or reaching

**Volume**: 5-10 swings before progressing to full speed

### The Exaggeration Drill

**Purpose**: Break old pattern when full speed tempts reversion

**Setup**: Full driver setup

**Execution**:
1. Take shorter backswing than normal
2. Make exaggeratedly low and left finish
3. Think: "Fade" or "low finish" or "around not out"
4. Don't care where ball goes - commit to the move
5. Feel like you're overdoing the rotational finish

**Success Markers**:
- Maintains 0-2° club path even at full speed
- Eliminates hooks completely
- Produces straight shots or slight fades
- Breaking through mental barrier of old pattern

**When to Use**:
- When full swings start reverting to high finish
- First few range sessions ingraining new pattern
- On course when hooks return

### The Phone Test (Diagnostic)

**Purpose**: Self-check for finish height regression

**Execution**:
- Keep phone in back pocket during swings
- Old pattern: Club hits phone on high finish
- New pattern: Club never reaches back pocket

**What It Tells You**:
- If club hits phone = reverting to high finish
- If club stays away = maintaining lower finish
- Simple, immediate feedback without video

## The Coaching Philosophy

### What They DIDN'T Change

**Setup**: Left alone despite being "quite bent forward"

**Backswing**:
- Noticed club goes slightly above plane (two-plane swing)
- Potential issue with arm position at top
- Student mentioned slight sway
- All ignored for this lesson

**Why**:
- Student already hits it well (3 handicap)
- Only hooks 2-3 drives per round
- At tour level, could just "manage" this swing shape
- Focusing on one thing: through-swing/finish

### Progressive Difficulty Strategy

**Start Easy, Build Up**:
1. Rehearsals with no ball
2. No backswing, just through-swing
3. Chip swings (50 yards)
4. 70% effort (220 yards)
5. Full effort with exaggeration
6. Full effort with normal feel

**Result**:
- Immediate improvement (5° to 0.3° on first real swing)
- Sustained improvement through progression
- Final swings: 0.2°, 0.4°, 0.5° paths (essentially straight)

### The Video Analysis Approach

**Comparison Method**:
- Saved original swing (5° right, high finish)
- Captured chip swing (0.3° right, lower finish)
- Captured full swing with new pattern (0.5° right)
- Showed all three side-by-side

**Key Visual**:
- Gap between club and plane line
- Original: Massive gap, club way above plane through impact
- New: Club much closer to plane, lower finish
- This visual showed what "finishing lower" actually means

## Key Takeaways

1. **The finish position you target dictates your through-swing path** - if you finish high and extended, the club must travel "out"; if you finish low and rotational, the club travels "around"

2. **One simple feel can transform ball flight** - "hands finishing lower" changed Nate's club path from 5° right to near 0° without addressing setup, backswing, or downswing

3. **Use alignment stick as "virtual ceiling"** - physical constraint forces you to find lower finish; remove once pattern established

4. **"Fade feel" can produce straight shots** - when your pattern is too inside-out (5° right), feeling like you're hitting fade brings path back to neutral

5. **Modern finishes are lower and more rotational** - tour players like JJ Spaun and Colin Morikawa finish with club lower and more around body, making it hard to get "handsy"

6. **Progress through mini swings first** - chip swings prove the concept before adding speed; use 70% effort as bridge to full power

7. **Exaggeration breaks old patterns** - when reverting to old finish, exaggerate the low/left finish even if it feels extreme

8. **Your worst shots reveal your pattern** - Nate's worst shots had highest finishes (hitting phone in pocket); eliminating high finish eliminated hooks

## Related Concepts

**Course Management Alternative**:
- For tour-level player with same pattern: could just "manage it" rather than change
- Play for slight draw, aim appropriately
- But amateur wanting consistency benefits from neutralizing path

**Colin Morikawa Reference**:
- When asked about technical details, kept it simple
- Draw = finish high; Fade = finish low
- Simple cue organized entire swing

**JJ Spaun Observation**:
- Me and My Golf stood next to him at US Open range
- Notably low finish position
- Hard to get "handsy" with low/left finish
- Produces consistent, straight ball flight

**Video Mentioned**: This was a standalone live lesson - no specific related video references provided in transcript

## Practice Recommendations

**First Range Session**:
- Bring alignment stick
- 20 no-backswing rehearsals
- 20 chip swings (50 yards)
- 10 swings at 70% effort
- 10 swings at full speed with exaggeration
- Goal: Ingrain lower finish feel

**Ongoing Practice**:
- Every driver session: Start with 5-10 chip swings focusing on finish
- If hooks return: Return to exaggeration drill
- Phone test: Confirm club not hitting back pocket
- Video check: Compare finish height to new pattern

**On-Course Application**:
- Pre-shot: One rehearsal of lower finish
- Swing thought: "Fade" or "low finish" or "around"
- If hook appears: More exaggerated low finish on next hole
- Trust that "fade feel" produces straight shots

**Danger Zones**:
- Full speed without warmup - likely to revert
- Simulator with low ceiling - actually beneficial as reminder
- Trying for extra distance - tends to trigger high finish
- Not completing finish - abbreviating loses the benefit
