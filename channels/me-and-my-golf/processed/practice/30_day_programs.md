# Me and My Golf: 30-Day Programs

**Three Progressive 4-Week Programs by Skill Level**

Each program is designed to be completed in 4 weeks with 3 range sessions per week and daily 10-15 minute home practice. Results are measurable and significant.

---

## PROGRAM SELECTION

**Choose based on your current situation:**

- **BEGINNER:** Never had formal instruction, struggling with basics, inconsistent contact
- **INTERMEDIATE:** Have played a while, identified specific fault, want targeted improvement
- **ADVANCED:** Good fundamentals, working on refinement and consistency
