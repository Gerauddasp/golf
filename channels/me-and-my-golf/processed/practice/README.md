# Me and My Golf: Practice System Overview

**Your Complete Guide to Structured, Effective Practice**

This practice system synthesizes 15 videos of coaching instruction into actionable practice templates, 30-day programs, and a searchable drill finder. Everything is designed for golfers who want to practice with purpose and measurable improvement.

---

## What's Inside This System

### 1. **Range Session Templates** (`range_session_templates.md`)
Five complete 60-minute range sessions, structured by focus:
- **Driver Focus Session** - Maximum distance and control
- **Iron Striking Session** - Pure contact and consistency
- **Fault Correction Session** - Target-specific problem fixing
- **Speed Training Session** - Power development
- **Wedge Distance Session** - Scoring zone mastery

Each includes warm-up, drill work, integration, and cool-down phases.

### 2. **30-Day Programs** (`30_day_programs.md`)
Three progressive 4-week programs by skill level:
- **Beginner Program** - Five foundational basics
- **Intermediate Program** - Fault diagnosis and correction
- **Advanced Program** - Refinement and consistency

Each program builds systematically with daily home practice and 3x/week range sessions.

### 3. **Drill Finder** (`drill_finder.md`)
Quick reference searchable by:
- Fault type (slice, hook, fat, thin, shank, etc.)
- Club (driver, irons, wedges, all clubs)
- Practice location (range vs. home)
- Time required (5 min, 15 min, 30 min)

Find exactly what drill you need in seconds.

## How to Use This System

### For Immediate Practice
1. **Check your current fault** using the fault diagnosis flowchart (from channel guides)
2. **Find your drill** in the Drill Finder
3. **Practice for 2-3 weeks** with intense focus on one fault
4. **Track one metric** (path, contact location, divot pattern, etc.)

### For Structured Improvement
1. **Choose your skill level** from the 30-Day Programs
2. **Commit to the timeline** (minimum 4 weeks, ideally 8+)
3. **Follow daily home practice** (10-15 minutes)
4. **Complete range sessions** 3x per week as specified
5. **Progress through phases** sequentially—no jumping ahead

### For Range Sessions
1. **Select template** matching your current focus
2. **Allow 15 minutes warm-up** (critical for quality practice)
3. **Follow drill work phase** (30 minutes)
4. **Integrate into swings** (15 minutes)
5. **End strong** (5 minutes with best swing only)

## Core Principles Behind This System

### 1. **One Thing at a Time**
Focus exclusively on one fault per 2-3 weeks. Attempting multiple fixes creates confusion and slower progress.

### 2. **Diagnosis Before Drilling**
Use the flowchart to identify root cause. You can't fix the right thing if you're diagnosing wrong.

### 3. **Feel vs. Real**
What feels "wrong" initially is often correct. Exaggeration breaks ingrained patterns. Trust data/video over feel during changes.

### 4. **Progressive Difficulty**
Start with abbreviated swings, build to full swings. Master at 75% before going 100%.

### 5. **Quality Over Quantity**
30 purposeful practice balls > 100 mindless swings. Every shot should have intention.

### 6. **Immediate Feedback**
Use mirrors, video, or launch monitor. Self-assessment after every shot accelerates learning.

### 7. **Pattern Programming**
Drills aren't "exercises"—they're programming new neural patterns. Expect 200-500 repetitions before automatic.

## Self-Assessment Checklist

### Before Practice Sessions
- [ ] Identified specific fault (not general "I'm bad")
- [ ] Know the root cause (backswing? face? setup?)
- [ ] Selected appropriate drill(s)
- [ ] Have feedback method (mirror/video/monitor)
- [ ] Clear on what "success" looks like
- [ ] Warmed up properly (10 min minimum)

### During Practice
- [ ] Every shot has a purpose
- [ ] Video/film at key checkpoints
- [ ] Track one primary metric
- [ ] Post-shot self-assessment
- [ ] If fault detected, rehearse correct pattern
- [ ] Gradual progression (don't rush phases)

### After Practice Sessions
- [ ] Note what improved
- [ ] Note what's still stuck
- [ ] Video review (compare start vs. end of session)
- [ ] Adjust tomorrow's focus if needed
- [ ] Rest and recover

## Tracking Progress

### Weekly Metrics to Monitor
- **Strike quality** - % of center strikes
- **Consistency** - deviation in ball flight
- **Divot pattern** - starting point relative to ball
- **Distance control** - consistency of carry distances
- **Fairways** - % in fairway on range targets
- **Path numbers** - if using launch monitor

### Monthly Check-In
1. Record baseline session (10 shots minimum)
2. Compare to previous month
3. Identify remaining gaps
4. Adjust program if needed
5. Video yourself (track setup changes)

### Quarterly Review
1. Assess overall transformation
2. Identify new faults to address
3. Plan next 90-day focus
4. Celebrate progress (important for motivation!)

## Equipment You'll Need

### Essential
- Golf clubs (what you practice with)
- Golf balls (practice grade is fine)
- Alignment sticks (2-3 helpful)

### Highly Recommended
- Phone/camera for video (critical for self-diagnosis)
- Tripod or stand for hands-free video
- Mirror (for home practice)

### Nice to Have
- Launch monitor (TrackMan, FlightScope, GCQuad)
- Impact bag or cushion
- Tee holder/mat
- Distance measuring device

### Optional
- Video analysis app (Me and My Golf app has built-in analysis)
- Training aids (impact spray, swing trainer, etc.)
- Notebook for tracking

## Special Notes

### For Golfers Without Range Access
Use the **30-day home practice programs** included. Many drills require no ball:
- Body motion practice (turn-shift-turn)
- Arm extension work (Set to Point abbreviated)
- Takeaway drills (Blue Line with household items)
- Position checks (mirror work)

You'll need range access occasionally (1-2x per month minimum), but substantial progress happens at home.

### For Golfers With Launch Monitor Access
You'll progress faster with objective data. Use monitor to:
- Identify patterns (path, face, attack angle)
- Calibrate feel to reality
- Validate improvements
- Track long-term trends

Without monitor, video is your best diagnostic tool.

### For Golfers Under Time Pressure
If you can only practice 1x per week:
1. Focus on home practice (daily, 10-15 min)
2. Make one range session count (90 min, focused)
3. Extend timeline (6-8 weeks instead of 4)
4. Prioritize Phase 1 (setup) if short on time

## Making It Work Long-Term

### Motivation Tips
1. **Track visible progress** - Keep simple log (fairways hit, center strikes %)
2. **Celebrate milestones** - New personal best, first round without common fault
3. **Play courses/comps** - Apply practice learning in real situations
4. **Vary practice formats** - Balance drill work with fun/game practice
5. **Share progress** - Tell family/friends about improvements

### Avoiding Burnout
1. **Take breaks** - One week lighter practice every 4-5 weeks
2. **Balance serious with fun** - 70% focused, 30% enjoyment-based
3. **Change environments** - Practice different courses occasionally
4. **Social practice** - Play with friends, not just solo practice
5. **Realistic timeline** - Real improvement takes months/years, not weeks

### Preventing Reversion
1. **Weekly fundamentals** - Always spend 5 minutes on setup/grip basics
2. **Primary drill forever** - Keep it in your warm-up permanently
3. **Monthly video check** - Compare current to milestone videos
4. **Mental cue maintenance** - Continue using the swing thought
5. **Occasional intensive weeks** - Every 2-3 months, refocus for 1-2 weeks

## Common Questions

**Q: How long until I see results?**
A: Setup changes show improvement same-session. Pattern changes take 2-4 weeks of consistent practice. Permanent integration takes 8-12 weeks.

**Q: Should I practice with music/distractions?**
A: Not during intensive drill work. Distractions reduce learning. Once pattern is established, occasional background noise okay.

**Q: How many balls per session?**
A: Quality over quantity. 50-75 focused balls > 150 mindless swings. Each ball should have intention.

**Q: Should I practice when tired?**
A: Not during intensive drill phases. Well-rested practice is twice as effective. If tired, use it for light technical work only.

**Q: Can I mix programs/drills?**
A: Not recommended during first 4 weeks. Stick with ONE program/fault. After that, can customize.

**Q: What if I plateau?**
A: Normal. Evaluate video for new breakdown. May need professional instruction. Try different drill variation.
