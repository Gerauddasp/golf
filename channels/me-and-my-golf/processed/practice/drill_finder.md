- Where: Range
- What: Backswing to top, pause, check arms wide, complete swing
- Why: Prevents over-the-top position
- Timeline: 80% of drives for 2 months
- Video: 001

**Advanced Fix (20 min):** Drag-Push-Toe Combo (Experimental)
- Where: Range with impact bag
- What: Drag club on ground from top, push toward target, toe into bag

- Video: 005

#### Hook (Ball Curves Left, Occasionally)
**Quick Fix (5 min):** Ball Position Check
- Where: Home or range
- What: Move ball back 3-4 inches (from left big toe to inside left foot)
- Why: Prevents face closing too early
- Immediate: Accept shots going farther right (step 1)
- Video: 014

**Main Drill (20 min):** Alignment Stick Ceiling Drill
- Where: Range
- What: Place stick at driver angle, use as physical ceiling for finish
- Why: Forces lower, rotational finish (no high extended finish)
- Progression: No backswing → half swing → chip swings → full swing
- Video: 015

**Supporting Drill (10 min):** Lower Finish Rehearsal
- Where: Home or range

- Video: 008

**Length Drill (10 min):** Backswing Extension
- Where: Home practice swings
- What: Try to see club in corner of eye during backswing
- Why: Longer backswing = more potential speed
- Note: Driver only, not irons

## TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### If Drill Isn't Working

**Check #1: Are you doing the drill correctly?**
- Rewatch video (slow motion if available)
- Compare your motion to video
- Film yourself for comparison
- Ask: Do your positions match?

**Check #2: Are you doing the drill long enough?**
- Most drills need 2-3 weeks intensive focus
- If only practiced 3 days, give it more time
- Rule: 200 reps minimum before expecting automation

**Check #3: Is the diagnosis correct?**
- Compare your fault to multiple videos
- Use launch monitor if available (objective data)
- Ask: Could it be a different fault?

**Check #4: Are you expecting the right outcome?**
- Fat shot fix might initially cause fat shots (pattern change)
- Slice fix might produce hooks (overcorrection)
- These are temporary during adaptation

**Action:** If still not working after 2-3 weeks:
1. Rewatch video
2. Get professional assessment (if possible)
3. Try different drill variation
4. Consider physical limitations (flexibility test)

## DRILL EFFECTIVENESS TRACKER

**Rate Each Drill (1-10 Scale)**

After one week of practice, rate your improvement:

| Drill Name | Date | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|------|--------|-------|
| | | | |

| | | | |
| | | | |

**Guidelines:**
- 8-10: This drill is working great, continue
- 5-7: This drill is helping but slowly, give it 2 more weeks
- 2-4: This drill isn't helping, try different diagnosis
- 1: This drill makes it worse, stop immediately
