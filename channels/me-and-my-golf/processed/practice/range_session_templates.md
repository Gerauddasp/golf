## SESSION 1: DRIVER FOCUS SESSION
**Goal:** Maximum distance with control
**Best For:** Golfers with good accuracy, wanting more distance
**Primary Videos:** 008 (Speed), 001 (Width), 002 (Biomechanics)

### Phase 1: Extended Warm-Up (15 min)
**Why Extended:** Speed work requires thorough warm-up

1. Dynamic stretching: 3 minutes
   - Arm circles (10 forward, 10 back)
   - Torso rotations (20 total)
   - Leg swings (20 total)
   - Glute bridges (15 reps)

2. Wedge swings: 3 minutes
   - Easy tempo, focus on connection
   - 10 swings building to normal pace

3. Iron swings: 4 minutes
   - Progressive: 9-iron → 7-iron → 5-iron
   - 5 swings each, building to good form

4. Driver building: 5 minutes
   - First 5 swings: 50% speed, focus on rhythm
   - Next 5 swings: 75% speed, add backswing speed feel
   - Last 5 swings: 90% speed, normal intensity

### Phase 2: Speed Development (25 min)

**Drill 1: Resistance Drill (5 min)**
- Have partner stand in backswing path
- Attempt 5 takeaway movements (can't move club)
- Feel full body engagement (hands, core, legs, hips)
- Key: Identify which muscles should fire

**Drill 2: Speed Backswing Practice (5 min, no ball)**
- Take 10 practice swings
- Focus: "Fling" club back with maximum impulse
- Think about accelerating the backswing
- Don't worry about position or follow-through
- Feel: Everything should be engaged

**Drill 3: Progressive Speed Hitting (10 min, 20 balls)**
- 5 balls at 70% effort (establish baseline)
  - Track distance mentally
  - Note how they feel
- 5 balls at 80% effort
  - Add more backswing speed feel
  - Slightly longer backswing length
- 5 balls at 90% effort
  - Approaching full intensity
  - Look for 5-10 yard distance gain
- 5 balls at 100% effort (full speed)
  - Compare final distance vs. first 5
  - Goal: 10-20 yard gain maintained
  - Check dispersion (shouldn't worsen)

**Drill 4: Overspeed Training (5 min, 5 balls)**
- 5 swings at 105% effort (accept less accuracy)
- Feel maximum acceleration through impact
- This trains nervous system for more speed
- Don't worry where balls go

### Phase 3: Integration (12 min)

**Integration Work (12 min, 25 balls)**

### Phase 4: Cool-Down (8 min)
- 5 driver swings at normal feel
- Note: Do they still feel fast?
- Expect: Yes - new speed pattern ingrained

### Russell Henley Key Principles
1. **5-yard increment system** - Own these distances
2. **Choke down 1 inch** - Creates consistency
3. **Think next shot** - Where will you putt from?
4. **Less loft preferred** - Control over high spin
5. **Flat trajectory** - More predictable than high spinny
