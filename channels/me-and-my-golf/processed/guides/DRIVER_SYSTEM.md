# Me and My Golf: Complete Driver System Guide

## Overview

This comprehensive guide synthesizes Me and My Golf's driver instruction system, combining biomechanical insights from TPI research, launch monitor data from real lessons, and proven drill progressions. The system emphasizes **diagnosis before prescription** - identify your specific fault pattern, then apply the targeted drill sequence. All instruction is backed by trackman data and demonstrates measurable improvements in club path, face angle, and strike quality.

**Core Philosophy**:
- Fix the source, not the symptom
- Use objective data (launch monitor, video) over feel
- Exaggerate corrections to break ingrained patterns
- Simple intention changes often trump complex mechanics

## Setup & Address Position

### Driver-Specific Setup Requirements

**Ball Position** *(Videos 7, 14)*
- **Standard position**: Opposite left heel (right-handed golfer)
- **Critical insight**: Ball position determines WHEN the face squares in the arc
- **Forward = later impact = more closed face** (can cause hooks with inside path)
- **Back = earlier impact = less closed face** (prevents over-closing)

**Diagnostic Test**:
1. Place alignment stick on ground at current ball position
2. Make slow-motion swing observing clubface at impact zone
3. If ball is at left big toe or beyond: face has too much time to close (risk of hooks)
4. If ball is centered: treating driver like an iron (promotes slice)

**TPI Biomechanical Requirements** *(Video 2)*:
- Spine tilt away from target (secondary axis tilt)
- Weight distribution: 55-60% on trail foot at address
- Wider stance than irons for stability
- Shoulders tilted to match spine angle
- Setup must promote **ascending blow** (+3° to +5° angle of attack)

### Posture & Balance Fundamentals *(Video 7)*

**The Early Extension Test**:
- Have partner place club vertically behind your butt at address
- Mark this reference line
- **Problem**: Butt pushed way back, weight on heels, creates 5-6" of forward movement in downswing
- **Solution**: Hips more over ankles, weight through middle of feet, feel taller

**Athletic Position Checklist**:
- [ ] Can resist being pushed backward
- [ ] Legs feel activated/engaged
- [ ] Weight through midfoot, NOT heels
- [ ] 1-2 inches from reference line (not 5-6 inches)
- [ ] Butt not pushed excessively behind ankles

**Common Setup Mistakes**:
- Ball too far back (iron setup) = face arrives open = slice
- Spine too vertical (no tilt) = can't hit up on ball = loss of distance
- Weight on heels = early extension = heel strikes
- Ball at left big toe or beyond = face closes too much = hooks

### Right Foot Position for Mobility Issues *(Video 1)*

**For Players with Limited Rotation**:
- Flare right foot out significantly
- Pull right foot back slightly from target line
- **Effect**: Allows deeper hip rotation without strain
- **Use case**: Back stiffness, mobility limitations, or stopping rotation early in backswing

**Success Marker**: Can achieve deeper, wound-up position at top without strain

---

## Backswing Fundamentals

### Width Maintenance *(Video 1)*

**The Narrow Arms Problem**:
- When body stops rotating mid-backswing, arms continue independently
- Result: Arms collapsed, club miles ahead of hands, very narrow at top
- **Consequence**: Only one place for club to go = over the top

**The Width Solution**:
- Mental image: "Big wind up and WIDE"
- Feel: Club almost vertical at top (like Nick Faldo)
- Physical sensation: Tension in lats (good tension, not strain)
- Legs stay separated (avoid collapse)
- Everything "wound up and in sync"

**Stop-at-Top Drill** *(Primary Pattern Programmer)*:
1. Right foot flared and pulled back (if needed)
2. Take backswing focusing on width and rotation
3. **STOP at top of backswing** - hold 1-2 seconds
4. Check: wide arms, good rotation, club not ahead of hands
5. Complete downswing smoothly and patiently

**Prescription**: 80% of drives should use stop drill for TWO MONTHS minimum

**Immediate Results** *(Student Case Study)*:
- Before: 4-6° left club path (over the top)
- After first session: 1.1° right path
- Subsequent shots: Clustered around 0° (straight)
- Path improvement: 4+ degree shift from backswing fix alone

### Backswing Speed & Length *(Video 8)*

**The Slow Backswing Problem**:
- Taking club back slow and controlled robs you of speed
- Only using arms/hands instead of full body
- Student Michelle: 71-72 mph clubhead speed with fairway accuracy

**Speed Test Data**:
- Slow/controlled backswing: 104 mph
- Fast backswing: 110 mph (+6 mph)
- Fast + longer backswing: 116 mph (+12 mph)
- **Key finding**: More backswing speed = more impact speed WITHOUT sacrificing accuracy

**The Sledgehammer Analogy**:
- Can't move sledgehammer with just hands/arms
- Whole body must engage: hands, core, legs, hips, feet
- Same applies to golf club

**Resistance Drill** *(Feel Full-Body Engagement)*:
1. Have partner stand in way of backswing path
2. Try to take club back but partner blocks it
3. Focus on where you feel it: everywhere - hands, core, legs, hips, feet
4. This is what backswing should feel like

**Speed Training Protocol**:
- Think "flinging the club back"
- Don't position carefully - just MOVE IT FAST
- Use body to create impulse and energy
- Must be warmed up (using body extensively)

**Length Extension**:
- After creating speed, allow arms to go further back
- Practice swings: Try to see club in corner of eye
- **Important**: Applies to DRIVER ONLY
- If you practice overswing, reality will be perfect length

**Results**: Michelle gained 10 mph while maintaining same accuracy

### Backswing Plane & Shoulder Tilt *(Video 10)*

**The Over-the-Top Backswing Pattern**:
- Club travels above plane on takeaway
- Shoulders too flat at top (left shoulder gets too high)
- Forces club to return above plane = out-to-in path

**The Counterintuitive Fix**:
- **Feel**: Club wraps AROUND body (feels too flat/inside)
- **Reality**: Exaggerated feeling produces neutral, on-plane position
- **Shoulder adjustment**: RIGHT shoulder moves DOWN (steeper tilt)
- **Critical**: What feels extreme produces what looks neutral

**Visual Checkpoint**:
- Use video feedback or alignment aids
- The feeling is completely opposite to what video shows
- Trust feedback, not ingrained perception

**Practice Prescription**:
- Could do this as practice swing "for a month" to ingrain feel
- Use exaggerated feeling even when hitting balls
- Before every shot: One rehearsal of "around" backswing

---

## Downswing Mechanics

### Sequence & Timing

**TPI Ground Force Pattern** *(Video 2)*:

**Driver-Specific Downswing**:
- Early pressure shift to lead side (before club starts down)
- Strong push from trail foot
- Maximum ground force at PRE-IMPACT (not at impact)
- Vertical force component to "push away" from ground
- Body pattern: Push-push (trail foot pushes, lead foot pushes)

**Key Difference from Irons**:
- Driver: "Stay back and swing up"
- Irons: "Move forward and swing down"
- Driver emphasizes vertical force; irons emphasize rotational force

### The Justin Rose Drill - Path Correction *(Video 10)*

**Purpose**: Fix severe over-the-top pattern (5-10° left club path)

**The Movement Pattern**:
1. Swing to top of backswing → STOP
2. **First move**: Shift/bump hips toward target
3. **Second move**: Drop arms DOWN (not forward)
4. **Key feeling**: Keep back facing target MUCH longer than comfortable
5. **Club position**: Club head stays BEHIND hands (under plane)
6. **Then rotate**: Body rotation naturally brings club to plane

**Critical Mental Cue**: "Keep your back to target for as long as possible"

**The Counterintuitive Reality**:
- If you didn't turn, path would be 15° right (too much)
- Rotation brings it back to neutral (0-2° right)
- Exaggerated feeling prevents over-the-top move

**Execution Drill**:
1. Pause at top
2. Shift hips forward
3. Let arms drop while chest/back faces away from target
4. Feel like you're trying to get club past ball while still facing backward
5. Eventually rotate but delay as long as possible

**Success Markers**:
- Club head stays behind hands on downswing
- Path moves from left to neutral/right
- Feels extremely uncomfortable initially
- Ball flight changes from slice/pull to straight/draw

**Real Results** *(Student Chris)*:
- Before: 5.7° left path (severe over-the-top)
- During progression: 3° left → 0.3° right → 1° right → 2.2° right
- Final result: 0.6° right path, 0.2° face angle = PERFECT

### The Drag-Push-Toe Combination Drill *(Video 5)*

**Purpose**: Simultaneously fix club path AND face angle for over-the-top slicers

**Warning**: EXPERIMENTAL drill - extremely powerful correction tool

**Equipment**: Driver + impact bag

**Setup**:
1. Place impact bag in impact position
2. Normal driver address
3. Take full backswing loading into trail leg

**Execution**:
1. **Drag Phase**: From top, place club on ground behind heels
2. **Push Phase**: Move toward target (lateral + rotation) dragging club on ground
3. **Toe Phase**: Aggressively drive toe of club into bag, rotating it closed
4. **Feel**: Like flipping bag with aggressive rotation - tennis forehand topspin

**Critical Safety Note**:
- Start with mini/half swings - full swings can cause injury with bag
- Be aware this is exaggerated correction
- May produce hooks if you don't have face control issues
- Monitor results - this drill is POWERFUL

**Real Results** *(Student Andrea)*:
- Path: Went from 5-10° left to right
- Face: Went from open to closed
- Ball flight: Transformed from slice to functional draw
- Instructor demo: Path 3.3° right, face 5.6° LEFT of that (dramatic closure)

**Key Insight**: Fixing path alone can make shots WORSE. Must fix both path (drag-push) AND face (toe into bag) simultaneously.

---

## Clubface Control

### The Critical Checkpoint - Waist-High Position *(Video 4)*

**The Open Face Problem**:
- When club shaft is parallel to ground on downswing, check leading edge
- **OPEN** = leading edge pointing up/back behind you (problem)
- **NEUTRAL** = toe pointing straight up in the air
- **IDEAL** = leading edge slightly ahead, toe past vertical

**Why It Matters**:
- Open face at waist-high forces body to stall rotation
- Stall is necessary to give hands time to flip and square face
- Results in inconsistent timing, blocks right, loss of power

**Body Adaptation Timeline**:
1. Fix face first (gets more closed)
2. Body subconsciously recognizes face is better
3. Body naturally rotates harder through impact
4. Path shifts slightly more in-to-out (2-3° right)
5. This creates proper draw conditions: in-to-out path + slightly closed face

### Position Check Drill *(Video 4)*

**Purpose**: Build awareness of clubface position and correct feel

**Execution**:
1. Swing to top of backswing and STOP
2. Swing down to waist-high (club shaft parallel to ground)
3. FREEZE at this position
4. Check club face: Is toe pointing up or laid back?
5. Practice getting toe straight up or slightly past vertical

**Practice Sequence**:
- Show yourself the BAD position (open/laid back)
- Show yourself the GOOD position (toe up/closed)
- Alternate between bad and good 5-10 times
- Build contrast and feel the difference

**Home Practice**:
- Work in front of mirror or film yourself
- Don't hit balls initially - just work positions
- Body will figure out how to move once it knows target position

### The "Nuclear" Bag Drill *(Video 4)*

**Purpose**: Exaggerate face closure to eliminate blocks and build rotation awareness

**Equipment**: Impact bag (or heavy bag/cushion) just outside ball position

**Execution**:
1. Swing to top
2. Swing down to waist-high with face STRONG (closed)
3. Continue closing face through impact zone
4. Hit bag with TOE of club FIRST
5. Exaggerate toe rotation - really shut it down

**Key Feels**:
- "Strong" clubface at waist-high
- Aggressive closing/rotation from waist-high to impact
- Toe leads heel into bag
- Feel like you're trying to hook it

**Progression**:
1. Drill only (no ball): Get toe-first bag strike
2. With ball: Expect hook on first attempts (this is GOOD!)
3. Gradually reduce exaggeration as consistency improves
4. Goal: Eliminate blocks, accept draws while learning

**Critical Philosophy**:
- "If it goes left, it goes left" - accept overcorrection initially
- Better to start with too much face closure than too little
- Body will automatically adjust path once face is better
- Only need 3-5° face angle change (all that's required)

**Real Results** *(Student Danny)*:
- Path was consistently excellent: 0.0° to 0.3° right
- Original face: 3-5° more open than path = blocks right
- After drills: Face 1-2° closed to path = straight to draw
- Only a 3-5° adjustment in face angle fixed the problem

### The "Heel vs. Toe Race" Concept *(Video 7)*

**Problem Diagnosis**:
- When slicing, heel of club is "winning the race" back to ball
- Clubface arrives at impact open (pointing right)
- Path may be good, but face open to path = slice

**Solution**: Get toe to "win the race"

**Toe-Wins Drill**:
1. Place impact bag or cushion in impact position
2. Set up with proper posture and ball position
3. **Soften hands and grip pressure** (critical)
4. Make slow-motion swings rotating toe into bag
5. Feel: Don't try to FORCE it - LET it happen
6. Toe should reach bag before heel

**Key Understanding**:
- Allow clubface to close, don't force it
- Tension in hands prevents natural rotation
- Softening grip is often the only change needed

### Wrist Position Through Impact *(Video 4)*

**The Cupping Problem**:
- Wrist "cupping out" through impact zone opens face
- Happens even when position is good at waist-high
- Last-second sabotage of good mechanics

**Solution**:
- Maintain strong/flat wrist through impact
- Let toe rotate, don't cup wrist
- Keep pressure on grip consistent through ball

---

## Through-Swing & Finish Position

### The Finish Position Principle *(Video 15)*

**Colin Morikawa's Simple System**:
- "If I want to play a draw, I'll finish high"
- "If I want to play a fade, I'll finish low"
- **One simple cue organizes entire through-swing**

**Critical Insight**: The finish position you target dictates the path that precedes it

**The Hook Problem Pattern** *(Student Nate)*:
- Original: 5° right club path, high extended finish (hitting simulator ceiling)
- Club extended dramatically away from body post-impact
- Arms fully extended, disconnected from body rotation
- Result: 5° right path + closed face = hooks

**The Low/Rotational Finish Solution**:
- Target lower finish with hands more around body
- Club travels "around" rather than "out" through impact
- Makes it "very hard to get active with hands" (reduces hooks)
- Brought path from 5° right to near 0° = dead straight

### Modern vs. Old School Finishes

**Old School**:
- High, fully extended arms
- Linear extension toward target
- Allows hands to become active
- Can produce hooks or two-way miss

**Modern** *(JJ Spaun, Colin Morikawa)*:
- Lower, more rotational finish
- Club wraps around body
- Hands finish below shoulder height
- Prevents excessive hand action

### The Alignment Stick Drill *(Video 15)*

**Purpose**: Create physical constraint forcing rotational finish

**Setup**:
1. Place alignment stick in ground at driver shaft angle at address
2. Position stick just outside through-swing path
3. Stick acts as "ceiling" preventing high finish

**Execution**:
- Start with no backswing - just impact to finish
- Swing club "around" body rather than "out" toward target
- Feel hands finishing lower and more left
- Key sensation: Hands tracing around, not extending away

**Progression**:
1. No backswing, just through-swing rehearsals
2. Halfway backswing, focus on finish
3. "Chip" swings (50 yards) maintaining lower finish
4. 70% effort (220 yards)
5. Full speed, maintaining feel

**Success Markers**:
- Hands finish below shoulder height (not above head)
- Finish position more rotational, less linear
- Club wraps around body vs. extending away
- Feel like making fade swing (even for straight shots)

### The No-Backswing Through-Swing Drill

**Purpose**: Isolate and train correct through-swing without backswing interference

**Execution**:
1. Take address position
2. Lift club slightly off ground (hover)
3. Move into impact position with body rotation
4. From impact, swing club "around" body to finish
5. Focus: Hands finishing lower and more left
6. Complete finish fully - don't abbreviate

**Volume**: 10-15 rehearsals with no ball before hitting shots

### The Chip-Swing Integration *(Video 15)*

**Purpose**: Bridge gap between rehearsal and full swing

**Execution**:
1. Take mini backswing (halfway or less)
2. Make full through-swing with proper finish
3. Goal: 50-70 yards carry (NOT distance)
4. Focus entirely on finish position, ignore result
5. Can "miss it, top it, hook it, slice it" - just get the move

**Success Markers**:
- Club path improves dramatically (Nate: 5° to 0.3° on first chip swing)
- Finish feels lower
- More body rotation, less arm extension

**Key Insight**: First chip swing proves the concept before adding speed

### The "Fade Feel" for Straight Shots *(Video 15)*

**Paradoxical but Effective**:
- When path is too far right (5° or more), feel like hitting fade
- Feel: Finish lower, more around body
- Result: Dead straight shots (near 0° club path)

**Why It Works**:
- Previous pattern was excessive inside-out (5° right)
- "Fade feel" neutralizes excessive inside path
- Brings path to neutral (0-1° right)
- With square face, produces straight shots

**Student Nate Results**:
- Told to feel like hitting fade
- Result: 0.2° club path (dead straight)
- Eliminated hooks completely

### Path Effects on Ball Flight

**TPI Research Findings** *(Video 2)*:
- Setup differences should be AMPLIFIED at impact, not reduced
- Driver impact: EVEN MORE tilted away than setup
- Upper body stays back while weight moves forward
- This pattern enables positive angle of attack (+3° to +5°)

**Feel vs. Real**:
- Tour players FEEL staying back excessively
- 3D data shows moderate reality
- Must exaggerate feel to achieve proper position

## Ball Flight Diagnostics

### The Two-Way Miss *(Video 14)*

**Pattern**: Missing both left (hooks) and right (blocks/pushes)

**Root Cause**:
- Ball position too far forward (opposite left big toe or beyond)
- Club path too far right (5° or more)
- Face closes at different rates on different swings
- When face squares: block right
- When face closes: hook left

**Diagnostic Test**:
1. Check ball position: Is it at or past left big toe?
2. Launch monitor: Is path more than 5° right?
3. Ball flight: Do you miss both directions?
4. If yes to all three: Ball position issue

**Solution Process**:

**Phase 1 - Create Predictable Miss**:
- Move ball back 3-4 inches (to inside left foot)
- Accept that path will increase to right initially (6-7°)
- Goal: Eliminate left miss completely
- Result: Consistent right miss (predictable is better than two-way)

**Phase 2 - Bring Path Back to Center**:
- From new ball position, FEEL like hitting fade
- Try to start ball LEFT of target line
- Check monitor: Likely see 1-2° right path (perfect)
- Calibrate feel to produce 2-4° right path
- Result: Slight draw path with neutral face = straight

**Student Michael Results**:
- Original: 5.5° right path, ball at left big toe, two-way miss
- Phase 1: Ball back, 6.6° right path, consistent right miss only
- Phase 2: "Fade feel" brought path to 1.8° right, dead straight
- No swing mechanics changed - just ball position and intention

### The Consistent Slice Pattern *(Videos 4, 5, 7)*

**Pattern**: Ball starts straight or right, curves right consistently

**Root Causes** (multiple possibilities):

**Cause 1: Open Face at Waist-High** *(Video 4)*
- Diagnosis: Check clubface when shaft parallel on downswing
- If leading edge points back/up: Open face problem
- Path may be good (0-3° right), but face open to path
- Result: Slice despite good swing path

**Cause 2: Poor Ball Position/Posture** *(Video 7)*
- Ball too far back (iron setup with driver)
- Early extension from poor posture
- Weight on heels causing forward movement
- Heel strikes compounding face issues

**Cause 3: Severe Over-the-Top** *(Video 5)*
- Path 5-10° left consistently
- Face opens 80% of time = slice
- Face squares 20% of time = pull left
- "Inconsistent" but path is actually consistent (left)

**Diagnostic Questions**:
1. What's your club path? (Need launch monitor)
   - If 0-3° right: Face control issue (Videos 4, 7)
   - If 3-7° left: Mild over-the-top (Videos 1, 10)
   - If 7-10° left: Severe over-the-top (Video 5)

2. Where do you strike the face?
   - Heel strikes: Early extension/posture issue (Video 7)
   - Center/toe strikes: Pure face angle problem (Video 4)
   - Inconsistent: Check ball position and backswing width (Videos 1, 14)

3. Where is your ball positioned?
   - Back/center: Too far back = opens face
   - At left heel: Correct
   - Past left heel: May be too forward (depends on path)

**Solution Selection Matrix**:

| Path | Strike | Ball Position | Primary Fix | Video Reference |
|------|---------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 0-3° right | Center | Good | Face control drills | Video 4 |
| 0-3° right | Heel | Good | Posture/toe setup | Video 7 |
| 3-7° left | Any | Any | Width/Justin Rose | Videos 1, 10 |
| 7-10° left | Any | Any | Drag-Push-Toe | Video 5 |

### The Occasional Hook Pattern *(Video 15)*

**Pattern**: Mostly straight/fade, occasional hook (2-3 per 14 drives)

**Root Cause**:
- Club path too far right (5° or more)
- High, extended finish allowing hands to activate
- Face closes inconsistently through impact
- On shots where face closes: path right + face closed = hook

**Diagnosis**:
- Check finish position: Does club hit phone in back pocket?
- Check club path: Is it 5° or more to the right?
- Check finish extension: Are arms fully extended away from body?

**Solution**: Lower, rotational finish (see Through-Swing section)

**Student Nate Results**:
- Before: 5° right path, high finish, occasional hooks
- After: Near 0° path, lower finish, dead straight
- Changed finish only - no backswing or setup changes

### The Block Pattern *(Video 4)*

**Pattern**: Ball starts right, stays right (no curve)

**Root Cause**: Path + Face both right, but face MORE right than path

**Typical Numbers**:
- Path: 0-3° right (good!)
- Face: 3-6° right (too open)
- Result: Block right

**Key Insight**: Path is NOT the problem - face control is

**Solution**: Nuclear bag drill (Video 4)
- Exaggerate face closure
- Expect hooks initially
- Gradually moderate to straight shots

**Common Mistake**: Trying to fix path when path is already good

### For Block/Open Face (Path Good, Face Open)

**Primary Issue**: Club path 0-3° right (good), but face 3-6° open

**Drill Sequence**:

1. **Waist-High Position Check** *(Video 4)* - Daily
   - In front of mirror
   - No ball needed
   - Contrast open vs. closed positions
   - **Goal**: Feel difference clearly

2. **Nuclear Bag Drill** *(Video 4)* - Every range session

   - Maintain face closure
   - Use if blocks return
   - **Goal**: Consistent straight shots

**Additional Consideration**:
- If heel strikes present: Fix posture first (Video 7)
- Check wrist cupping through impact (Video 4)
- Ensure ball position is at left heel, not forward (Video 14)

**Timeline**: 2-4 weeks for face control improvement

### For Two-Way Miss (Both Left & Right)

**Primary Issue**: Path 5-7° right, ball too far forward, inconsistent face closure

**Drill Sequence**:

1. **Ball Position Adjustment** *(Video 14)* - Immediate
   - Move ball back 3-4 inches
   - From outside left foot to inside left foot
   - Accept increased right path initially
   - **Goal**: Eliminate left miss completely

2. **Predictable Miss Phase** *(Video 14)* - Week 1
   - Hit 20-30 drives new position
   - All should miss right (if any miss)
   - Confirm no left misses
   - **Goal**: One-way miss pattern

3. **Fade Feel Calibration** *(Video 14)* - Week 2
   - Feel like hitting fade
   - Check launch monitor path
   - Find feel that produces 2-4° right
   - **Goal**: Path back to neutral

4. **Integration Phase** *(Video 14)* - Week 3-4

   - Use fade feel for straight shots
   - Monitor with video/data
   - **Goal**: Consistent straight/slight draw

**Critical Success Factors**:
- Must use launch monitor for calibration
- Feel vs. real will be opposite
- Don't rush back to old ball position
- Accept that "fade feel" produces straight shots

**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks with launch monitor access

### For Occasional Hooks (Mostly Straight, 2-3 Hooks per Round)

**Primary Issue**: Path 5° right, high extended finish, inconsistent hand action

**Drill Sequence**:

1. **No-Backswing Through-Swing** *(Video 15)* - Daily
   - 10-15 rehearsals
   - Focus only on finish
   - Hands lower, more around
   - **Goal**: Feel new finish pattern

2. **Chip Swing Proof** *(Video 15)* - First range session
   - 50-yard mini swings
   - Full finish emphasis
   - Check path on monitor
   - **Goal**: Path improves to near 0°

3. **70% Power Integration** *(Video 15)* - Week 1-2
   - 220-yard target (not full power)
   - Maintain lower finish
   - Build consistency
   - **Goal**: Maintain path at 70%

4. **Full Speed with Exaggeration** *(Video 15)* - Week 3+
   - Fade feel, low finish
   - Don't care where it goes initially
   - Commit to new pattern
   - **Goal**: Eliminate hooks at full speed

**Maintenance**:
- Phone test (club shouldn't hit phone in pocket)
- Return to chip swings if hooks reappear
- Use alignment stick as ceiling reminder
- One rehearsal of low finish before each drive

**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks for full integration

### For Loss of Distance (Good Accuracy, Low Speed)

**Primary Issue**: Slow, controlled backswing; short backswing length

**Drill Sequence**:

1. **Resistance Drill** *(Video 8)* - Week 1
   - Partner blocks backswing
   - Feel full-body engagement
   - Identify proper muscles
   - **Goal**: Understand what should fire

2. **Speed Backswing Practice** *(Video 8)* - Daily at home
   - No ball needed
   - "Fling club back"
   - Use body for impulse
   - **Goal**: Fast backswing feel

3. **10-Shot Comparison** *(Video 8)* - Every range session
   - First 10: Normal swing
   - Last 10: Fast backswing
   - Compare distance visually
   - **Goal**: 10-20 yard gain

4. **Length Extension** *(Video 8)* - After speed established
   - See club in corner of eye
   - Practice swings only initially
   - Driver only (not irons)
   - **Goal**: Longer arc = more speed

**Speed Test Protocol**:
- With launch monitor: Look for 5-10 mph gain
- Without launch monitor: Visual distance comparison
- Check dispersion doesn't worsen
- Must be warmed up thoroughly

**Real Results**: +6-12 mph clubhead speed possible

**Timeline**: 4-8 weeks, speed gains progressive

### For Heel Strikes (Good Path, Poor Contact)

**Primary Issue**: Early extension from poor posture, or over-the-top

**Diagnostic**:
1. Check posture at address (Video 7)
2. Check backswing plane (Video 10)
3. Determine if posture or path issue

**If Posture Issue** *(Video 7)*:

1. **Balance Foundation Drill**
   - Reference line behind butt
   - Hips forward over ankles
   - Weight through midfoot
   - Feel taller, more activated

2. **Posture Maintenance**
   - Hit drives monitoring space to reference
   - Goal: 1-2 inches behind line
   - Check for pulls (indicates early extension)

**If Path Issue** *(Video 10)*:
- Follow over-the-top drill sequence (see above)
- Path correction often fixes heel strikes

**Final Solution** *(Video 10)*:
- **Toe Address Position**
  - Set up with ball at TOE of driver
  - Actively try to hit off toe
  - Ball migrates to center

**Success Case** *(Student Chris)*:
- Heel strikes persisted even with good path
- Toe setup produced center strikes
- Best shot: 275 yards, 0.6° path, center strike

## Progressive Difficulty: Feel vs. Real

### The Exaggeration Principle

**Core Concept**: To fix an ingrained pattern, you must feel like you're doing the EXTREME opposite.

**Why It Works**:
- Ingrained patterns feel "normal" even when they're wrong
- Small adjustments feel like nothing
- Brain can't detect 3-5° changes without exaggeration
- Exaggerated feeling produces neutral reality

**Examples from Videos**:

1. **Backswing Plane** *(Video 10)*
   - Feel: Club wraps way inside (feels too flat)
   - Reality: Club on plane (neutral)

2. **Face Closure** *(Video 4)*
   - Feel: Try to hook it (toe-first bag strike)
   - Reality: 3-5° face closure (straight to slight draw)

3. **Downswing Sequence** *(Video 10)*
   - Feel: Keep back to target forever
   - Reality: Proper sequencing with on-plane delivery

4. **Finish Position** *(Video 15)*
   - Feel: Finish way low and left (fade)
   - Reality: Neutral path with straight ball flight

5. **Ball Position** *(Video 14)*
   - Feel: Ball way out front (fade intention)
   - Reality: Brings path from 7° right to 2° right

### Feel vs. Real Timeline

**Week 1-2: Massive Gap**
- What you feel and what you do are completely opposite
- Requires constant video/data feedback
- Uncomfortable and unnatural
- Trust data over feel

**Week 3-4: Calibration**
- Starting to feel "less weird"
- Still need some feedback
- Finding your personal feels
- Building awareness

**Week 5-8: Integration**
- Exaggerated feel becoming normal
- Less frequent feedback needed
- Can self-correct with feel
- Pattern becoming automatic

**Week 9-12: Ownership**
- New pattern feels natural
- Can detect deviations by feel
- Occasional video check for confirmation
- Old pattern feels wrong now

### Video Feedback Protocol

**Essential Setup**:
- Down-the-line camera angle
- Capture full swing (address through finish)
- Use alignment stick or Me and My Golf app for plane lines
- Compare before/after side-by-side

**What to Check**:

**Backswing**:
- [ ] Club on plane at takeaway
- [ ] Width maintained (arms not collapsed)
- [ ] Shoulder tilt (right shoulder down, not flat)
- [ ] Club position at top (not above plane)

**Downswing**:
- [ ] Club slots under (not over the top)
- [ ] Club head behind hands at halfway down
- [ ] Path relative to target line
- [ ] Strike location on face

**Finish**:
- [ ] Height of hands (below shoulder vs. above head)
- [ ] Extension away vs. rotation around
- [ ] Balance and posture maintained

**Comparison Method** *(Video 10)*:
- Save original swing (the problem)
- Capture drill swing (first improvement)
- Capture full swing with new pattern
- Show all three side-by-side
- Look for specific changes, not perfect swing

### Launch Monitor Data Requirements

**Essential Metrics**:

1. **Club Path**
   - Target range for driver: 0-4° right
   - Too far left (5-10° left) = over-the-top
   - Too far right (5-7° right) = two-way miss risk
   - Near 0° = straight shots

2. **Face Angle** (Relative to Path)
   - 1-2° closed to path = draw
   - Square to path = straight
   - 3° or more open = block/slice
   - Only need 3-5° adjustment to fix most problems

3. **Attack Angle**
   - Target: +3° to +5° up
   - Negative (down) = losing distance
   - Too steep up (7-8°) = losing consistency

4. **Strike Location**
   - Use impact spray or face tape
   - Heel strikes = early extension or over-the-top
   - Toe strikes = backing away or addressing toe
   - Center = optimal

5. **Spin Rate**
   - Target: 2,000-2,800 RPM
   - Under 2,000 = low spin bomber (rare, usually good)
   - Over 3,000 = too much spin (slice spin or gear effect)

**Calibration Process**:

**Session 1: Baseline** (10 shots)
- Record all metrics
- Identify pattern (not one-off results)
- Note worst shots (reveal true pattern)

**Session 2-4: Drill Integration** (20 shots each)
- First 10: With drill/exaggeration
- Last 10: Gradually moderate
- Track metric changes
- Find your "feels"

**Session 5+: Calibration** (30 shots)
- Various feels/intentions
- Map feel to actual numbers
- Lock in what produces target numbers
- Build consistency

### TPI Insights: 3D vs. 2D Analysis *(Video 2)*

**Why Video Alone Isn't Enough**:
- 2D video from face-on or down-the-line misses rotational elements
- Ground force patterns invisible to camera
- Actual weight distribution different from visual perception
- Pressure location vs. center of mass location

**What 3D Reveals**:
- Kinematic sequence (order and timing of body segment acceleration)
- Ground reaction force (vertical vs. rotational components)
- True club path in 3D space
- Weight shift magnitude and timing
- Hip rotation speed (target: 100-120 mph for driver)

**Practical Application Without 3D**:
- Use launch monitor for club data (path, face, speed)
- Use pressure mat or bathroom scale for weight shift
- Use video for positions and plane
- Combine all three for complete picture

**Key TPI Findings for Driver**:
- Elite players show 80-90% weight on trail foot at top
- Maximum ground force at PRE-IMPACT (not impact)
- Vertical force component creates "push up" feel
- Upper body stays back MORE at impact than at setup (axis tilt increases)

## Common Compensations & Solutions

### The Body Stall Compensation

**What It Looks Like**:
- Body rotation slows or stops before impact
- Hands flip to square face
- Loss of power
- Inconsistent timing

**Root Cause**: Open clubface forcing compensation

**Why Body Stalls**:
- Subconscious knows face is open
- If body rotates fully with open face, ball goes way right
- Body compensates by stopping to give hands time
- Stall is symptom, not cause

**Solution**: Fix the face, body will rotate naturally
- Waist-high position check (Video 4)
- Nuclear bag drill (Video 4)
- Once face is better, body automatically rotates harder
- Path may shift 2-3° more right (this is correct)

**Student Danny Example** *(Video 4)*:
- Path was excellent (0.0-0.3° right)
- Body stalled because face was open
- Fixed face angle with bag drill
- Body rotation improved automatically
- Path stayed excellent, face became closed to path

### The Narrow Arms Compensation

**What It Looks Like**:
- Arms collapse at top of backswing
- Club gets way ahead of hands
- Very narrow position
- Forces over-the-top downswing

**Root Cause**: Body stops rotating mid-backswing, arms continue alone

**Why It Happens**:
- Physical limitations (back issues, flexibility)
- Poor setup restricting rotation
- Over-focusing on quiet lower body
- Trying to be too controlled

**Solution Sequence**:
1. Adjust setup (right foot position) - Video 1
2. Create width feel (big wind up and wide) - Video 1
3. Stop-at-top drill (80% of drives, 2 months) - Video 1
4. Feel tension in lats (good tension) - Video 1

**Student with Back Surgery** *(Video 1)*:
- Limited rotation from previous surgery
- Right foot adjustment enabled deeper turn
- Width focus prevented arms collapse
- Path improved 4+ degrees (6° left to 1° right)

### The High Finish Compensation

**What It Looks Like**:
- Arms fully extended at finish
- Hands above head or behind
- Club hitting ceiling/phone in pocket
- Very linear extension toward target

**Root Cause**: Allows hands to become active, close face inconsistently

**Why It Causes Hooks**:
- Path often 5° or more right
- Extended finish allows hands to flip
- Sometimes face squares (block right)
- Sometimes face closes (hook left)
- Inconsistent hand timing

**Solution**: Lower, rotational finish
- No-backswing rehearsals (Video 15)
- Chip swings focusing on finish (Video 15)
- Alignment stick as ceiling (Video 15)
- Fade feel for straight shots (Video 15)

**Student Nate Example** *(Video 15)*:
- 5° right path, occasional hooks
- High, extended finish
- Lower finish brought path to near 0°
- Eliminated hooks completely
- No backswing or setup changes needed

### The Early Extension Compensation

**What It Looks Like**:
- Moving toward ball during downswing
- Loss of space between butt and reference line
- Heel strikes
- Pulls or blocks

**Root Cause**: Poor posture at address (weight on heels, butt too far back)

**Why It Happens**:
- Imbalanced address position
- Can't rotate properly from poor position
- Body compensates by moving forward
- Trying to "get to the ball"

**Solution**: Athletic posture at address
- Hips over ankles (Video 7)
- Weight through midfoot (Video 7)
- Feel taller, more activated (Video 7)
- Reference line feedback (Video 7)

**Additional Fixes**:
- Toe address position if heel strikes persist (Videos 7, 10)
- Headcover outside ball (angled right) (Video 10)
- Monitor space during swing, not just at setup

### The Backswing Above Plane Compensation

**What It Looks Like**:
- Club travels above plane on takeaway
- Shoulders flatten at top
- Forces over-the-top return

**Root Cause**: Feeling of "lifting" club rather than rotating

**Why It Happens**:
- Trying to get club "up" rather than "around"
- Arm-dominant takeaway
- Lack of body rotation
- Poor shoulder tilt (shoulders too flat)

**Solution**: Exaggerated around feel
- Club wraps around body (feels flat) - Video 10
- Right shoulder moves DOWN - Video 10
- Practice swing before every shot - Video 10
- Video feedback essential - Video 10

**Student Chris Example** *(Video 10)*:
- Club above plane on backswing
- Forced over-the-top downswing (5.7° left)
- Exaggerated "around" feel put club on plane
- Path improved to 0.6° right
- "Feels wrong but it straightens driver"

### The Wrist Cup Compensation

**What It Looks Like**:
- Wrist cups (extends) through impact
- Opens face at last moment
- Happens even with good positions earlier

**Root Cause**: Excessive tension or trying to guide shot

**Why It Happens**:
- Tight grip pressure
- Trying to control face manually
- Fear of closing face too much
- Compensating for inside path

**Solution**:
- Soften hands throughout (Video 7)
- Allow face to close (Video 4)
- Maintain flat/bowed wrist (Video 4)
- Pressure consistent through ball (Video 4)

## Equipment Considerations

### Driver Optimization Based on Your Pattern

**For Over-the-Top Slicers** (Path Left, Face Open):
- **Loft**: Need MORE loft to compensate for negative attack angle
  - Hitting down on driver needs 11-13° loft
  - Fix attack angle first, then can reduce loft to 9-10.5°
- **Shaft**: Need help squaring face
  - More flexible tip section
  - Lighter weight for more clubhead speed
  - Softer flex overall
- **Face Angle**: Consider draw-biased or closed face setting
- **Lie Angle**: More upright may help if severe slice

**For Two-Way Miss** (Path Right, Inconsistent Face):
- **Loft**: Likely need LESS loft once pattern fixed
  - Currently hitting up (good)
  - May be adding dynamic loft with flip
  - Once face control improves, 9-10.5° optimal
- **Shaft**: Need stability through impact
  - Stiffer tip section
  - Heavier weight for consistency
  - May need 1/2 flex stiffer
- **Face Angle**: Neutral to slightly open
  - Closed face may exacerbate hooks

**For Occasional Hookers** (Path Right, High Finish):
- **Loft**: Often optimal already (9-10.5°)
- **Shaft**: May benefit from fade-biased shaft
  - Stiffer tip
  - Lower torque
  - Keeps face from closing excessively
- **Face Angle**: Slightly open may help
- **Swing Weight**: Lighter might reduce hand action

**For Distance Seekers** (Good Accuracy, Low Speed):
- **Loft**: Depends on attack angle
  - Positive attack (+3-5°): 9-10.5° loft
  - Neutral attack (0°): 10.5-11.5° loft
- **Shaft**: Need speed generation
  - Lighter weight (45-55g range)
  - More flexible for more whip
  - Longer length if can control (45.5-46")
- **Head Design**: Low spin for speed players
  - Forward CG
  - Lower spin head design

### Tee Height Effects

**Standard Height**: Ball equator at top of driver face
- Works for most patterns
- Promotes optimal launch

**Higher Tee** (+0.5"):
- Encourages more upward attack angle
- Good for slicers (promotes right path)
- Can increase launch angle
- Risk of hitting too high on face

**Lower Tee** (-0.5"):
- Promotes more neutral attack
- Good for those hitting too high on face
- Can reduce excessive hook spin
- Risk of hitting down on ball

### Ball Selection by Pattern

**For Slicers**:
- Higher spin ball can help SLIGHTLY
- But fixing swing is 10x more important
- Low spin ball makes slice worse
- Mid-to-high spin (3-piece or 4-piece)

**For Hookers**:
- Lower spin ball reduces hook curve
- But fixing high finish is better long-term solution
- 2-piece or low-spin 3-piece

**For Distance Seekers**:
- Low spin ball IF you generate sufficient spin
- High compression for high speed players
- But swing speed increase matters more than ball

### On-Course Application

**Pre-Round Warm-up** (15 minutes with driver):

**Phase 1** (5 min): Pattern Reinforcement
- 5-10 swings with primary drill
- No ball, just rehearsal
- Lock in feels

**Phase 2** (5 min): Calibration
- 10 drives with ball
- Start at 70% speed
- Build to 90% (not full speed)
- Confirm pattern is present

**Phase 3** (5 min): Mental Preparation
- 5 drives with course strategy
- Simulate first tee shot
- Commit to swing thought for day

**On-Course Strategy**:

**Swing Thought Selection**:
- Choose ONE thought maximum
- Related to your primary fix
- Examples:
  - "Wide at top" (width fix)
  - "Back to target" (over-the-top fix)
  - "Soft hands" (face control)
  - "Low finish" (hook elimination)
  - "Fade feel" (two-way miss)

**First 3 Holes**:
- Conservative clubs even on reachable par 5s
- Goal: Establish pattern in competition
- Don't chase distance - find timing

**Mid-Round Checks**:
- If pattern returns: Return to exaggerated feel immediately
- Don't wait until it compounds
- One exaggerated practice swing before next shot
- Reset mental cue

**Post-Round Review**:
- Fairways hit: X/14
- Pattern observations: Did old miss return?
- When did it work best? (tight fairway pressure? downhill lie?)
- When did it fail? (after layup? fast play?)

## Quick Reference: First Checkpoint Finder

**Use this flowchart to identify your starting point:**

### Question 1: Do you have launch monitor access?

**YES** → Hit 10 drives, note path and face angle → Go to Question 2

**NO** → Describe your typical miss → Go to Question 3

### Question 2: What is your club path?

**5-10° LEFT** → Over-the-Top Pattern
- Primary drill: Stop-at-top width (Video 1)
- Secondary: Justin Rose drill (Video 10)
- Timeline: 6-8 weeks

**0-3° RIGHT, face is OPEN (3-6°)** → Face Control Issue
- Primary drill: Nuclear bag drill (Video 4)
- Secondary: Waist-high position check (Video 4)
- Timeline: 2-4 weeks

**5-7° RIGHT** → Two-Way Miss Pattern
- Primary drill: Ball position adjustment (Video 14)
- Secondary: Fade feel calibration (Video 14)
- Timeline: 3-4 weeks

**Path GOOD but strike on HEEL** → Posture/Extension Issue
- Primary drill: Balance foundation (Video 7)
- Secondary: Toe address position (Videos 7, 10)
- Timeline: 2-3 weeks

### Question 3: Describe your typical miss (without launch monitor)

**"I slice it right every time"** → Could be two issues:
- Check ball position: At left heel or centered?
  - Centered: Setup issue (Video 7)
  - At heel: Likely path or face issue
- Film swing down-the-line
- Look for: Club above plane on backswing? → Over-the-top (Videos 1, 10)
- Look for: Leading edge pointing back at waist-high? → Face control (Video 4)

**"Sometimes I hook it, sometimes I block it right"** → Two-Way Miss
- Likely ball too far forward + right path
- Start with ball position fix (Video 14)
- Timeline: 3-4 weeks with monitor recommended

**"I hit it straight mostly, but occasionally hook"** → High Finish Pattern
- Primary drill: Lower finish work (Video 15)
- Timeline: 4-6 weeks

**"I hit it accurate but short"** → Speed Issue
- Primary drill: Backswing speed training (Video 8)
- Timeline: 4-8 weeks

**"My strikes are on the heel consistently"** → Early Extension
- Primary drill: Posture foundation (Video 7)
- Or: Toe address position (Videos 7, 10)
- Timeline: 2-3 weeks

**"I pull it left straight"** → Over-the-top with square face
- Path is left, face is square to path
- Primary drill: Over-the-top sequence (Videos 1, 10)
- Timeline: 6-8 weeks

**"Everything - I'm all over the place"** → Multiple Issues
- Start with setup (Video 7)
- Then width (Video 1)
- Then face control (Video 4)
- Timeline: 8-12 weeks
- MUST get launch monitor access for this pattern

- Problem: Open face at waist-high causing blocks
- Solution: Nuclear bag drill (toe-first strikes)
- Result: 3-5° face adjustment eliminated blocks

**Video 5** *(Drag-Push-Toe Combo)*: jOH7sofDhYA
- Problem: Severe over-the-top + open face
- Solution: Combined drill (drag + push + toe rotation)
- Warning: Very powerful - use carefully

**Video 7** *(Setup & Posture)*: b4GyyCQUBjc
- Problem: Iron setup with driver, early extension
- Solution: Ball forward, athletic posture, toe-wins-race
- Result: Heel strikes eliminated, slice fixed

**Video 8** *(Backswing Speed)*: zLcisJEGmhk
- Problem: Slow controlled backswing robbing distance
- Solution: Fast backswing + longer arc
- Result: +6-12 mph clubhead speed gain

**Video 10** *(Justin Rose Drill)*: mupl4w6kw9k
- Problem: Severe over-the-top (5.7° left)
- Solution: Back to target, arms drop, exaggerated feels
- Result: 5.7° left to 0.6° right in one session

**Video 14** *(Ball Position)*: 85wNu1-Ls7o
- Problem: Two-way miss (hooks and blocks)
- Solution: Ball position adjustment + fade feel
- Result: Two-way miss to consistent straight/draw

**Video 15** *(Finish Position)*: n09ULTsRAWg
- Problem: Occasional hooks, high extended finish
- Solution: Lower rotational finish
- Result: 5° right path to 0° path, hooks eliminated

## Appendix: Launch Monitor Target Numbers

### Driver Optimal Ranges

**Club Path**:
- Slight draw bias: 2-4° right
- Straight: 0-2° right
- Slight fade bias: 1-3° left
- **Problem zones**:
  - Over 5° right: Two-way miss risk
  - Over 5° left: Over-the-top slice

**Face Angle** (Relative to Path):
- Controlled draw: 1-3° closed
- Straight: +/- 1° of path
- Controlled fade: 1-3° open
- **Problem zones**:
  - 4° or more closed: Hook
  - 4° or more open: Slice

**Attack Angle**:
- Optimal: +3° to +5° up
- Acceptable: +1° to +7° up
- **Problem zones**:
  - Negative (down): Major distance loss
  - Over +7°: Inconsistent, too high launch

**Ball Speed** (relative to clubhead speed):
- Smash factor target: 1.48-1.50
- Example: 100 mph CHS = 148-150 mph ball speed
- Below 1.45: Poor strike or poor equipment fit

**Launch Angle**:
- Depends on ball speed, but roughly:
  - 100 mph CHS: 11-13° launch
  - 110 mph CHS: 10-12° launch
  - 120 mph CHS: 9-11° launch

**Spin Rate**:
- Optimal: 2,000-2,600 RPM
- Low spin: Under 2,000 (can be good if controlled)
- High spin: Over 3,000 (usually slice spin or gear effect)

**Carry Distance** (PGA Tour averages for reference):
- 100 mph CHS: 240-250 yards
- 110 mph CHS: 265-275 yards
- 120 mph CHS: 290-300 yards

**Dispersion**:
- Excellent: Within 20 yards left/right
- Good: Within 30 yards left/right
- Acceptable: Within 40 yards left/right
- Problem: Over 40 yards spread

## Final Thoughts: The Me and My Golf Approach

**Philosophy Principles**:

1. **Diagnosis Before Prescription**
   - Use launch monitor data
   - Use video analysis
   - Identify the root cause, not the symptom

2. **Evidence-Based Instruction**
   - TPI research backing
   - Trackman data confirmation
   - Real student results

3. **Exaggeration for Change**
   - Feel vs. real is opposite
   - Exaggerate corrections
   - Trust data over feel

4. **Simple Over Complex**
   - One swing thought maximum
   - Intention changes over mechanics
   - Finish position can control everything

5. **Individual Variation**
   - Work WITH your strengths (like Student Michael's fast hips)
   - Accommodate limitations (like Student with back surgery)
   - Find YOUR feels, not generic advice

6. **Long-Term Programming**
   - 2 months minimum for pattern change
   - Consistent practice with drills
   - Maintenance after initial fix

**The Most Important Insight**:

"You haven't had to think about shallowing. I don't think anyone ever needs to think about shallowing in the golf swing." - Me and My Golf

Fix the SOURCE (backswing width, face position, finish target), and the downswing takes care of itself. Don't try to fix the downswing directly - fix what CREATES the faulty downswing.
