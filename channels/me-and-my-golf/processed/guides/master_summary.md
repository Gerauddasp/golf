## Introduction & Channel Philosophy

### Core Teaching Principles

**1. Data-Driven Instruction**
- Extensive use of launch monitor technology (TrackMan, etc.)
- 3D motion capture analysis (collaboration with TPI)
- Ground force plate data to understand kinetics
- Objective feedback over subjective feel

**2. Root Cause Diagnosis**
- Address the SOURCE of problems, not just symptoms
- Example: Early extension often caused by steep backswing, not downswing issue
- Example: Head drop often compensating for arm extension loss (Video 3)
- Fix upstream problems to eliminate downstream compensations

**3. TPI Biomechanics Integration**
- Partnership with Titleist Performance Institute co-founder Dave Phillips
- Science-backed understanding of body-swing connection
- Kinetics (ground forces) precede kinematics (body movement)
- Universal movement patterns across rotary sports

**4. Individual Pattern Recognition**
- Identify YOUR tendency: "Twister" vs. "Slider" (Video 11)
- Work with physical capabilities and limitations
- Customize solutions rather than one-size-fits-all
- Example: Adjusting setup for student with back surgery (Video 1)

**5. Simple, Actionable Coaching**
- Break complex movements into understandable pieces
- Use relatable analogies (sledgehammer, tennis forehand, etc.)
- Immediate application on range with measurable results
- Progressive drill sequences from easy to difficult

**6. Tour-Level Insights**
- Russell Henley's #1-ranked wedge system (Video 6)
- TPI research from thousands of professional swings
- Colin Morikawa and JJ Spaun references
- Translating tour-level concepts to all skill levels

## Setup Fundamentals

### Driver Setup (Videos 2, 7, 14)

**Ball Position**
- Forward in stance: Opposite or inside left heel (for right-handed golfers)
- NOT center stance like irons
- Too far forward (opposite big toe) = face closes too much, causes hooks (Video 14)
- Adjust position based on tendency: Move back 3-4 inches if hooking

**Spine Tilt (Secondary Axis Tilt)**
- Right shoulder lower than left at address
- Tilted away from target
- Creates upward angle of attack (+3 to +5° for elite players)
- Must be present at address AND amplified at impact (TPI data, Video 2)

**Weight Distribution**
- 55-60% on trail foot at address
- Shift to 80-90% trail foot at top of backswing
- Promotes hitting up on the ball
- Elite players show pressure into trail heel during backswing

**Stance Width**
- Wider than iron stance
- Creates stability for speed generation
- Outside of heels just wider than hips
- Too narrow prevents proper leg engagement (Video 12)

**Right Foot Position (for limited rotation)**
- Flare right foot out slightly
- Pull back slightly from square
- Accommodates physical limitations (back stiffness, etc.)
- Allows deeper hip rotation without strain (Video 1)

### Iron Setup (Videos 2, 3)

**Ball Position**
- More centered in stance (varies by iron length)
- Creates descending blow (negative angle of attack)
- Ball-first contact with divot after ball

**Spine Angle**
- More neutral than driver
- Less secondary axis tilt
- Stack remains more aligned (shoulders, hips, hands, ball)

**Weight Distribution**
- More even at address (50-50 or slightly favoring lead side)
- Shifts to 80-90% lead side at impact
- Promotes forward compression and ball-first contact

**Distance from Ball**
- Critical for preventing early extension (Video 9)
- Tricep Line Test: Vertical line down back of tricep should:
  - Pass slightly in front of knees
  - Run through base of toes
- Too far = gap forces early extension to reach ball

### Posture Fundamentals (Video 9)

**Hip-Ankle Alignment**
- Hips directly over ankle joint
- NOT positioned far behind heels
- Start tall, hinge forward from hip joint
- Soften legs (don't over-bend)

**Weight Through Feet**
- Middle of feet, through the arches
- NOT on heels, NOT on toes
- Should feel "ready to do squats"
- Balance test: Should resist being pushed backward

**Common Setup Errors**
- Butt too far behind heels (causes early extension)
- Over-bent legs (pushes butt back)
- Weight on toes (instability, jumping through impact)
- Narrow stance taking legs out of equation

## Backswing Mechanics

### Width Principles (Video 1)

**The Width Concept**
- Arms maintain separation from body
- Extended rather than collapsed/narrow
- Creates proper swing radius
- "Big wind up and WIDE" feel

**Narrow Arms Problem**
- When rotation stops early, arms continue independently
- Creates narrow, collapsed position at top
- Club head ahead of hands
- Forces over-the-top downswing (only path available)

**Width Creates Path**
- Narrow arms at top = over-the-top almost guaranteed
- Proper width = club can shallow naturally
- Student shifted path 4+ degrees by adding width (Video 1)
- "Don't think about shallowing - think about width"

### Backswing Speed (Video 8)

**Speed in Backswing = Speed at Impact**
- Slow, controlled backswing robs distance
- Fast backswing creates momentum and elastic energy
- Demonstrated gain: 104 mph to 116 mph (+12 mph)
- Michelle gained 10 mph with faster backswing

**Full Body Engagement**
- Backswing requires whole body, not just arms
- Sledgehammer analogy: Can't move heavy object with just hands
- Feel tension in hands, core, legs, hips, feet
- "Standing in the Way" drill reveals proper engagement

**Backswing Length (Driver Only)**
- Longer backswing = more distance (basic physics)
- If you practice overswinging, reality will be perfect length
- See club in corner of eye during practice swings
- Think: "If club goes further back, it will go further" (like putting)

**Martin Borgmire Example**
- Longest hitters create massive shaft bend on backswing
- Shows force and impulse into club handle
- Speed in backswing loads the shaft
- Creates elastic energy release at impact

### Arm Depth and Plane (Videos 9, 10, 12)

**Arm Depth Concept**
- Arms wrap AROUND body, not lift UP
- Too upright = arms lift rather than turn
- Proper depth = left arm works around body
- Creates shallower downswing plane automatically

**Club Butt Line Checkpoint**
- At top of backswing, draw line down butt of club
- Should point toward heel line
- Too far in front of toe line = arms too upright
- Upright arms = steep downswing = early extension compensation

**Visual Drill: Club on Ground at 30-40°**
- Place club on ground just in front of foot
- Angle it 30-40 degrees
- Arms too upright: Can't see club (head between arms)
- Proper depth: Can see club above arm clearly (Video 9)

**On-Plane Checkpoint (Video 12)**
- When club parallel to ground in backswing
- Shaft should also be parallel to target line
- Too inside = points right of target
- Too outside = points left of target
- Perfect = parallel to ground AND target

### Connected vs. Disconnected Takeaway (Video 12)

**The Disconnection Problem**
- Hands move away from body (outward)
- Arms separate too early
- Club pushes above swing plane
- Forces compensating "loop" on downswing

**Victor's Results**
- Before: Inconsistent contact, heel strikes, shanks
- After: "Zero heel strikes" in 8 shots
- Path improved from 1° to 3° right
- 163-yard carry vs. 157 before (6 iron)

**Connected Takeaway Solution**
- Keep arms "connected" to body
- Hands stay inside reference line
- Arms and body work as one unit
- Feels like "I'm not moving anything - just there"

**The Blue Line Drill**
- Training aid held at chest height
- Practice takeaway keeping arms under/inside line
- Old move: Arms push into line
- New move: Arms stay close, never hit line

### The "Keep Back Facing Target" Principle (Video 10)

**Justin Rose Drill**
- Top of backswing → STOP
- First move: Shift/bump hips toward target
- Second move: Drop arms DOWN (not forward)
- Key: Keep back facing target MUCH longer
- Club head stays BEHIND hands (under plane)

**Why This Works**
- If you never turned, path would be 15° right
- But rotation brings it to neutral (0-2° right)
- Exaggerated feeling prevents over-the-top
- Creates inside-out path naturally

**Chris's Transformation (Video 10)**
- Before: 5.7° left path (severe over-the-top)
- After: 0.6° right path with 0.2° face angle
- Carry distance: 275 yards
- Achieved by feeling "extremely uncomfortable" initially

## Downswing Sequencing & Ground Forces

### TPI Kinetic Sequence (Video 11)

**Kinetics = Ground Forces (The CAUSE)**
- How you apply force into ground through feet
- Newton's law: Equal and opposite reaction
- Force precedes motion - must push to create movement
- Measured by force plates at TPI facility

**Kinematics = 3D Body Motion (The EFFECT)**
- How body actually moves in space
- Tracked by high-speed cameras with motion capture markers
- You CANNOT see kinematic sequence on regular video
- Requires specialized equipment to measure accurately

### The Four-Horse Race: Proper Sequence

**Horse #1: Lower Body** (First out of the gate)
- Small lateral movement/push
- Much smaller than most think
- Happens much quicker than you realize
- Trigger that starts everything

**Horse #2: Trunk** (Torso rotation)
- Begins after lower body initiates
- Starts to turn and rotate
- Previous segment slows to transfer energy

**Horse #3: Lead Arm**
- Accelerates after trunk begins
- Receives transferred energy from trunk

**Horse #4: Club**
- Final segment to accelerate
- Receives all accumulated energy
- Creates "crack of the whip" effect

**Critical Insight**: Each segment accelerates then SLOWS DOWN to transfer energy to next. This creates effortless power of elite players.

### The Four Kinetic Forces (Video 11)

**Timing**: All peak forces happen from top of backswing to lead arm parallel (NOT at impact!)

**Force #1: Lateral** (Happens FIRST)
- Small lateral movement toward target
- Creates the "bump" or shift
- Equal and opposite reaction creates side bend
- SHALLOWS the club automatically
- Gives club a "head start"

**Force #2: Side Bend** (Spinal tilt)
- Natural result of lateral force
- Key to shallowing club path
- Not consciously created - result of ground force
- Creates space for club to shallow

**Force #3: Horizontal Torque** (Rotation)
- Brings club out in front of body
- Delivers club to ball
- Timing is critical relative to lateral force

**Force #4: Vertical Force** (Pushing into ground)
- Allows delivery of angles into back of ball
- Creates "long legs, short torso" look at impact
- Maintains posture through impact zone
- Elite players push INTO ground early, not at impact

### Driver vs. Iron Downswing Differences (Video 2)

**Driver Downswing Characteristics:**

*Ground Force Pattern:*
- Early pressure shift to lead side (before club starts down)
- Strong push from trail foot
- Maximum force at pre-impact, not at impact
- Vertical force component to "push away" from ground
- Tour players show "push-push" pattern creating speed

*Body Mechanics:*
- Lower body leads rotation
- Upper body stays back longer (axis tilt maintained)
- Arms drop while body rotates
- Path approaches from inside
- Feel: "Stay back and swing up"

**Iron Downswing Characteristics:**

*Ground Force Pattern:*
- Similar lead side shift but different timing
- More rotational force (less vertical)
- Maximum force closer to impact
- More linear force toward target

*Body Mechanics:*
- More forward body motion
- Lead side straightens earlier
- Steeper shaft delivery
- Weight moves forward through impact
- Feel: "Move forward and swing down"

### When Sequence Goes Wrong (Video 11)

**Problem: Trunk Goes First ("Twister")**
- Upper body fires before lower body
- "Kills" lower body - can't catch up
- Creates steep, over-the-top path
- Ball flight: Starts left, slices, or pulls
- Most common amateur pattern

**Fix for Twisters**: Add Lateral
- Feel: Bump/slide toward target to start downswing
- "Spread the ground apart" with feet
- Don't worry about rotation - still happens naturally
- Just need better "head start" with lateral
- Will shallow club automatically

**Problem: Too Much Lateral ("Slider")**
- Lower body slides excessively
- Club gets stuck behind and under plane
- Path too much from inside
- Ball flight: Blocks right or hooks left
- Common in players with injury history

**Fix for Sliders**: Add Rotation
- Fire trunk/oblique abdominals from top
- Turn trunk early
- This STABILIZES lower body
- Stops excessive leg drive
- Next segment (trunk) stops previous segment (legs)

## Clubface Control

### The Waist-High Checkpoint (Videos 4, 5)

**Critical Position**
- When club shaft parallel to ground on downswing
- Most important checkpoint for face angle
- Impact happens too fast to control consciously
- Get it right here, impact takes care of itself

**Ideal Position:**
- TOE pointing straight up (minimum)
- Leading edge slightly closed, toe past vertical (ideal)
- Club head slightly behind hands
- Face "closed" relative to open position

**Open Position (The Problem):**
- Leading edge pointing back/up behind you
- Toe laid back toward sky
- Forces body to stall to allow hands time to square
- Creates blocks to right

**Danny's Numbers (Video 4):**
- Path: 0-2.8° right (excellent - not the problem)
- Original face: 3-5° more open than path = blocks
- After drills: Face 1-2° closed to path = straight/draw
- Only needed 3-5° adjustment to fix problem

### Face Control Throughout Swing (Video 13)

**The Natural Rotation Pattern**
- Setup: Clubface pointing at target (square)
- Backswing: Clubface opens (can see face)
- Impact: Returns to square (pointing at target)
- Follow-through: Closes (can see back of club)

**Common Beginner Mistake**
- Trying to keep face pointing at target throughout
- Causes two problems:
  1. Inconsistent direction
  2. Stops body from turning properly

**The "Handshake" Feel**
- Backswing: Like shaking hands with someone on right (opens)
- Through-swing: Like shaking hands with someone on left (closes)
- Natural rotation, not forced manipulation

**Table Tennis Paddle Drill** (Video 13)
- Use paddle to visualize face rotation
- Red side = clubface, Black side = back
- Makes motion more visible
- Setup: Red facing target
- Backswing: See red clearly (open)
- Follow-through: See black (closed)

### The Two-Part Drill Progression (Video 4)

**Drill 1: Waist-High Position Check**

*Purpose:* Build awareness and learn correct feel

*Setup:* No ball initially

*Execution:*
1. Swing to top and STOP
2. Swing to waist-high (shaft parallel to ground)
3. FREEZE at position
4. Check: Is toe up or laid back?
5. Practice getting toe straight up or past vertical

*Practice Sequence:*
- Show yourself BAD position (open/laid back)
- Show yourself GOOD position (toe up/closed)
- Alternate 5-10 times
- Build contrast and feel difference

**Drill 2: The "Nuclear" Bag Drill**

*Purpose:* Exaggerate face closure to eliminate blocks

*Setup:* Impact bag just outside ball position

*Execution:*
1. Swing to top
2. Down to waist-high with face STRONG (closed)
3. Continue closing through impact
4. Hit bag with TOE of club FIRST
5. Exaggerate toe rotation - shut it down

*Key Feels:*
- "Strong" clubface at waist-high
- Aggressive closing from waist-high to impact
- Toe leads heel into bag
- Feel like trying to hook it

*Results:*
- First attempts produce hooks (this is GOOD!)
- Eliminates blocks completely
- Creates 3-5° face angle change needed
- Body automatically adjusts path once face better

### Face-to-Path Relationship (Video 4)

**Ball Flight Laws**
- Club path determines START direction
- Club face (relative to path) determines CURVE
- Path left + Face open = Slice right
- Path left + Face square/closed = Pull left
- Path right + Face closed to path = Draw

**Only 3-5° Matters**
- Small adjustment has huge impact
- Face 1-2° closed to path = controlled draw
- Face square to path = straight
- Face 3°+ open to path = block right

**Body Adaptation**
1. Fix face first (get it more closed)
2. Body subconsciously recognizes face is better
3. Body naturally rotates harder through impact
4. Path shifts slightly more in-to-out (2-3° right)
5. Creates proper draw conditions
6. More power from better rotation

## Strike Quality & Ball Contact

### Ball-First Contact Fundamentals (Video 3)

**The Arm Extension Requirement**
- "Chicken wing" (left arm bending through impact) is strike killer
- Bending arm shortens swing radius
- Forces head/body to drop to compensate and reach ball
- Results: Fat shots and thin shots

**Dan's Pattern Analysis**
- Body movement excellent (good hip shift, impact line)
- BUT elbows flare apart through impact
- Swing radius decreases when elbows separate
- Head drops 2+ inches in downswing to compensate

**Physical Screening**
- 90/90 test and lat length test both passed
- Not a mobility limitation
- Issue is swing pattern, not physical restriction

### The Set to Point Drill (Video 3)

**Purpose:** Teach proper arm extension and eliminate chicken wing

**Setup:**
- Use tee to encourage focusing on movement
- Start with 7-iron or mid-iron
- Think "low punch shot"

**Execution:**
1. SHORT backswing (waist height)
2. Focus on keeping elbows CLOSE TOGETHER
3. Swing through with SHORT follow-through (waist height)
4. Feel like SQUEEZING elbows together through impact
5. Keep body rotation active (not just arms)
6. Maintain club speed

**Success Markers:**
- Tee still in ground after shot
- Divot starts AFTER ball position (1 inch after)
- Crisp, compressed contact sound
- Ball flight lower than normal (correct for drill)
- Distance: 120-130 yards with abbreviated swing

**Common Concern Addressed:**
- "Won't I hit it fat if I extend arms while head drops?"
- Answer: Initially might hit few fat shots
- Head drop is COMPENSATION for shortened arms
- Once arms extend properly, head stops dropping naturally
- Don't judge after 3 shots - give 10-15 swings to adapt

### Ground Contact Principles (Video 13)

**Critical Question:**
Where should you strike ground relative to ball?

**Correct Answer:**
Strike ground PAST the ball (not before)

**Proper Sequence:**
1. Strike BALL first
2. Then hit GROUND after ball
3. Creates divot pattern of tour pros
4. Ball-first contact = solid, consistent strikes

**Ground Contact Training Drill**

*Setup:* Can practice on mat or grass, no ball

*Execution:*
1. Set up to side of where ball would be
2. Make practice swings hitting ground past ball position
3. On mat: See/feel where you're striking
4. On grass: Watch divot location
5. Incorporate "turn, shift, turn" motion
6. Focus on low point being past ball

**Visual Learning:**
- Look where divot is taken relative to ball
- Ball position HERE, divot PAST it
- This is pattern to replicate

### Heel Strike Solutions (Videos 7, 10, 12)

**Causes of Heel Strikes:**

1. **Early Extension** (Video 7)
   - Poor posture with weight on heels
   - Moves 5-6 inches forward through downswing
   - Brings center closer to ball
   - Solution: Better posture, hips over ankles

2. **Disconnected Takeaway** (Video 12)
   - Arms separate from body going back
   - Creates compensating loop
   - Club pokes too far forward
   - Solution: Connected takeaway, wider stance

3. **Persistent Pattern** (Video 10)
   - Even with good path, heel contact continues
   - Simple fix: Address ball at TOE of club
   - Actively try to hit off toe
   - Ball migrates to center of face

**Victor's Zero Heel Strikes** (Video 12)
- Changed only setup and takeaway
- Wider stance prevented disconnection
- Connected takeaway kept club on plane
- Result: "Zero heel strikes" in final 8 shots

### The Impact Line Concept (Video 3)

**What It Is:**
- Line marking where body should be at impact
- Getting to this line = good weight shift
- Proper sequencing indicated

**Dan's Pattern:**
- Reached impact line EARLY (good)
- Good hip rotation and shoulder movement
- But compensated with head drop
- Caused by shortened arm radius

**Relationship to Strike:**
- Good body position + shortened arms = fat/thin
- Solution: Maintain body position, fix arms
- Don't sacrifice good body movement

## Short Game: Russell Henley's Wedge System

### Overview (Video 6)

**Russell Henley Credentials:**
- PGA Tour professional
- Statistically ranked #1 in world from 75-100 yards
- Not just good - elite level wedge play
- Tour-proven system, not theory

**Collaboration Value:**
- Genuine tour-level insights
- Strategic thinking behind every shot
- Mental approach separating elite from average
- Systematic practice methodology

### The 5-Yard Increment System

**Core Concept:**
- Practice wedges in 5-yard increments (90, 95, 100, 105)
- Each wedge has 3-4 distinct swing lengths
- Can reliably execute these specific distances
- Cannot think about "97-yard swing" but can execute confident 95 or 100

**Why This Works:**
- Creates matrix of distances across multiple wedges
- Complete yardage coverage
- Trades pinpoint yardage matching for reliable execution
- Practice focuses on OWNING specific distances

**Clock System Integration:**
- 90 yards = 9:00 position
- 95 yards = 9:30 position
- 100 yards = 10:00 position
- 105 yards = 10:30 position
- Visual reference points for practice swings
- Small increments but crucial for repeatability

### The Choke Down Foundation

**Universal Application:**
- Russell chokes down ~1 inch on ALL wedge shots
- Applied even on full wedge shots (not just partial)
- Non-negotiable part of his system

**Benefits:**
- Better contact quality
- Shallower angle through turf
- Promotes body rotation
- Psychological: Signals brain for lower trajectory
- Takes away excessive hand hinge
- Creates consistent strike pattern (10,000+ RPM every shot)

### Less Loft = More Consistency

**Russell's Preference:**
- Uses less lofted wedges with controlled swings
- Example: 51° from 100 yards (normally 120-yard club)
- Instead of full lob wedge
- Guarantees more consistency with spin and flight

**Why It Works:**
- Flatter trajectory = more predictable
- More consistent first bounce and roll-out
- Less affected by wind
- Easier to control distance

**Common Amateur Mistake:**
- Pulling out maximum loft
- Struggling with height/distance control
- High spinny shots less predictable than flat penetrating ones

### Strategic Putting Position Over Pin-High

**The Mental Shift:**
- Consider where you want to putt FROM first
- Pick position BEFORE selecting shot
- Would rather have 10-foot straight uphill
- Than 6-foot downhill breaking putt

**Pin Selection Strategy:**
- Green Light Pins: 6+ yards from edge - attack directly
- Yellow Light Pins: 3 yards from edge - play to fat side
- Pick side of hole with better putt, not necessarily closest

**Jordan Spieth Example:**
- Dominance partially due to high percentage of straight putts
- Approach shot position created putting opportunities
- Not just about getting close to pin

**Slope Considerations:**
- Back-to-front sloped greens: Being short better than pin-high
- Consider second shot (putt) before hitting first shot (approach)
- Strategic positioning over aggressive pin-seeking

### Distance Control by Scenario

**100 Yards - Green Light Pin (6 yards from edge)**

*Club Selection:* 55° wedge (sand wedge)
*Strategy:* Attack flag directly, pick side with better putt
*Technique:*
- Neutral swing path
- Choke down 1 inch
- Ball position: Feels middle, actually slightly back
- Target swing: 100-yard feel (10:00 on clock)
*Execution Note:* First shot carried 94 yards

**80 Yards - Risk of Spinning Back**

*Club Selection:* Same 55° wedge
*Strategy:* Land past hole, let spin back slightly
*Technique Adjustment:*
- Move ball position half-ball back
- Target 85-yard swing for 80-yard carry
- Creates flatter trajectory (40-45 feet vs 50+ feet max height)
- Margin for error: 80-yard result acceptable due to reduced spin
*Execution Note:* Carried 79 yards with lower flight

**100 Yards - Into Wind, Severe Back-to-Front Slope**

*Club Selection:* 51° wedge (gap wedge - normally 120 full)
*Strategy:* Take spin off, land at 95, let hop and stop
*Reasoning:* 55° with spin would rip back too far on slope
*Technique:*
- Shorten backswing significantly (20-yard reduction)
- Same choke-down grip
- Low, penetrating ball flight
- Risk assessment: 15-18 feet past acceptable
*Execution Note:* Carried 91 yards, exceptionally low trajectory

**75 Yards - Buried Lie in Rough**

*Club Selection:* Lob wedge
*Strategy:* Land at 65 yards, short of green, accept 30-foot chip
*Technique - The Cut Shot Method:*
- Ball position back
- Come "over the top" about one degree
- Steeper angle to get more ball contact
- Hold face through impact (rough wants to close it)
- Target 75-yard swing for 65-yard carry
*Execution Note:* Carried 61 yards, safer than going long

**75 Yards - Sitting Up in Light Rough**

*Club Selection:* Lob wedge (could use less loft)
*Strategy:* Land on front edge (68 yards), expect reduced spin
*Lie Reading:* Down-grain grass = better strike, less resistance
*Technique:*
- Neutral swing path (no cut needed)
- Target 70-yard swing
- Plan for slightly less spin due to grass
- Aim for margin of error on short side
*Execution Note:* Carried 73 yards (guessed 72 immediately)

### Jim McLean's Practice Drill

**The Immediate Feedback Loop:**

1. Hit wedge shot
2. Immediately say out loud what distance you think you hit
3. Check actual number
4. Repeat to train feel and calibration

**Russell's Use:**
- Uses constantly in practice
- Can predict within 1-2 yards consistently
- Develops neural pathway between swing feel and actual distance
- Critical for distance control development

**How to Implement:**
- Don't check TrackMan before guessing
- Say number out loud (commitment)
- Note difference between feel and reality
- Adjust internal calibration
- Repeat until predictions accurate

### Trajectory Philosophy

**Russell's Quote:**
"I like seeing them kind of flat. I don't like to hit big high spinny wedges. I like kind of flat ones and I know I can hit my number."

**Why Flat is Better:**
- Flatter trajectory = more consistent distance
- High spinny shots less predictable
- More affected by wind
- Harder to control exactly where lands

**When to Go High:**
- Firm greens requiring more spin
- Must carry hazard close to green
- Generally prefers predictable over spectacular

### The Lie Assessment Matrix

**Buried in Rough:**
- Cut shot technique
- Land short of target
- Accept conservative result
- 30-foot chip better than 50-foot putt past

**Sitting Up in Rough:**
- Down-grain: Normal swing, expect slight distance loss
- Against grain: Potential flyer, use less club
- Read grass direction carefully

**Fluffy Lie:**
- Dangerous - can go long with reduced spin
- Ball sitting on top of grass
- Club slides under easily
- Use more loft or less club

### Common Amateur Mistakes

1. **Too Much Loft:** Pulling lob wedge and hitting too high
2. **Full Swings:** Trying aggressive swings from 75-100 yards
3. **Ignoring Next Shot:** Not considering putt difficulty
4. **Trying to Be Perfect:** Attempting exact yardages vs. owning specific distances
5. **Into Wind:** Swinging harder instead of using less loft
6. **Out of Rough:** Trying to nuke it instead of accepting safe play

### Setup Fundamentals (Wedges)

**Stance:**
- Slightly narrower than full shots
- Not quite 50/50 but more narrow than driver
- Ball position: Feels middle, actually slightly back
- Choke down 1 inch on grip (always)

**Ball Flight Goals:**
- Neutral to slight draw shape
- Not trying to work ball significantly
- Focus on consistent strike over shot shape
- Exception: Cut shot from buried rough

**Body Motion:**
- More body rotation, less hand hinge
- "Using my body" feel vs. "hitting with hands"
- Abbreviated follow-through compared to full shots
- Maintains connection throughout

## Beginner Foundations: The 5 Basics

### Video 13: Complete Beginner Curriculum

**Target Audience:**
- Complete beginners feeling overwhelmed
- Too much information causing confusion
- Need simplified, sequential approach
- Want to reach golf course quickly (2 months)

### Basic #1: The Grip - Build It in the Air

**Problem with Traditional Method:**
- Most build grip with club on ground
- Forces club too vertical in hand (incorrect)
- Club should be diagonal across hand (correct)

**Proper Method:**
- Hold club by shaft with face vertical (square)
- Position at eye line, pointing to belt buckle
- Build grip in the air, NOT on ground

**Left Hand Placement (right-handed golfers):**
- Rest club through middle of forefinger to base of little finger
- Close hand around grip
- Thumb sits slightly right side of grip
- Visual checkpoints:
  - See two knuckles on left hand
  - V between thumb and forefinger points to right shoulder
  - Can support club with just forefinger

**Right Hand Placement:**
- Position at eye line with belt buckle
- Place as if shaking hands
- Across middle of forefinger, base of little finger
- Close hand with thumb on top
- Right thumb sits left side
- V points to right shoulder

**Grip Style for Beginners:**
- Start with baseball grip (fingers touching)
- Don't overcomplicate with overlap/interlock
- Keep hands close together
- Simplicity aids learning

**Benefits:**
- Controls shot direction (helps clubface)
- Uses wrists properly for power
- Massive head start for consistent striking

### Basic #2: Body Pivot - Turn, Shift, Turn

**The Simple Three-Part Motion:**
1. Turn (backswing)
2. Shift (downswing)
3. Turn (through-swing)

**Why It Matters:**
- How body moves shapes how club moves
- Critical for proper striking
- Can practice without ball

**Backswing - Turn:**
- Golf is rotational sport
- Turn chest, turn hips
- NO lateral movement away from target
- Pure rotation

**Downswing - Shift:**
- Shift toward target
- Lateral movement toward ball
- Weight transfers forward

**Through-Swing - Turn:**
- Rotation through impact
- Finish facing target
- All weight on front leg
- Back foot released up onto toe
- Hips and chest facing target

**Practice Without Ball:**
- Can do at home or driving range
- Cross arms across shoulders
- Focus: Turn, shift, turn
- Break down slowly, blend into fluid motion
- Train body movement before hitting shots

### Basic #3: Ground Contact - Hit Past the Ball

**The Critical Question:**
Where should you strike ground relative to ball?

**Common Misconception:**
Strike ground before the ball

**Correct Answer:**
Strike ground PAST the ball

**Proper Sequence:**
1. Strike BALL first
2. Then hit GROUND after ball
3. Creates divot pattern of tour pros

**Practice Drill:**
- Can practice on mat or grass
- Set up to side of where ball would be
- Make practice swings hitting ground past ball position
- On mat: See/feel where striking
- Incorporate turn, shift, turn motion
- Focus on low point past ball

**Why It Matters:**
- Ground before ball = inconsistent contact
- Ball-first contact = solid, consistent strikes
- Critical skill for course play

### Basic #4: Clubface Awareness - Open, Square, Close

**Visual Aid:**
- Use table tennis paddle
- Red side = clubface
- Black side = back of club
- Makes motion visible and understandable

**The Clubface Reality:**
- Clubface responsible for where ball starts
- Needs awareness throughout swing

**Proper Motion Pattern:**
- Setup: Clubface pointing at target (square)
- Backswing: Clubface opens (can see "red")
- Impact: Returns to square (pointing at target)
- Follow-through: Closes (can see "black")

**The "Handshake" Feel:**
- Backswing: Like shaking hands with someone on right (opens face)
- Through-swing: Like shaking hands with someone on left (closes face)

**Common Mistake to Avoid:**
- Trying to keep face pointing at target throughout
- Causes two problems:
  1. Inconsistent direction
  2. Stops body from turning properly

**The Motion:**
- Opening → Square → Closing
- Natural rotation of clubface
- Understanding produces better motion

### Basic #5: Follow a Plan - Don't Get Lost

**The Information Overload Problem:**
- Too much available on YouTube
- Bouncing tip to tip creates confusion
- Multiple coaches with different philosophies
- Getting lost in contradictions

**The Solution:**
- Follow structured, sequential plan
- Stick with one coaching philosophy
- Accelerate learning with organized progression

**Me and My Golf's Program:**
- "How to Play" Level 1, 2, and 3
- Beginner to golf course in two months
- Covers all fundamentals systematically
- Includes short game and putting
- First game management guidance

**Benefits of Having Plan:**
- More fun during learning
- Get to course faster
- Avoid confusion and wasted time
- Systematic progression through skills

## Common Faults & Fixes

### Over-the-Top Slice Pattern (Videos 1, 5, 10)

**Diagnosis:**
- Club path 5-10° left consistently
- Club above plane on backswing
- Narrow arms at top or disconnected
- Steep downswing approach
- Ball starts left, slices right OR pulls left

**Root Causes:**
1. Narrow arms at top (Video 1)
2. Arms too upright in backswing (Video 9)
3. Disconnected takeaway (Video 12)
4. Shoulders too flat at top (Video 10)

**Fix #1: Width in Backswing** (Video 1)
- "Big wind up and WIDE" feel
- Maintain separation between hands and body
- Right foot position adjustment if needed
- Stop drill: Pause at top, check width
- Result: 4+ degree path improvement

**Fix #2: Drag and Push + Toe Drill** (Video 5)
- Drag club on ground from top of backswing
- Move toward target while dragging
- Drive toe into impact bag aggressively
- Fixes BOTH path (goes right) AND face (closes)
- Andrea's path: From 5-10° left to right

**Fix #3: Justin Rose Drill** (Video 10)
- Stop at top of backswing
- Shift hips, drop arms DOWN
- Keep back to target much longer
- Then rotate through
- Chris: 5.7° left to 0.6° right in one session

### Two-Way Miss with Driver (Videos 7, 14, 15)

**Pattern:**
- Missing both left AND right unpredictably
- Makes course management impossible
- Indicates competing issues

**Diagnosis - Michael's Case** (Video 14):
- Path 5.5° right (inside-out)
- Ball position too far forward (left big toe)
- Face closing at inconsistent rates
- Result: Can push right OR hook left

**Fix: Ball Position + Intention** (Video 14)
1. Move ball back 3-4 inches (inside left foot)
2. Eliminates left miss (creates predictable right)
3. Change intention to "fade feel"
4. Brings path from 7° right to 2° right
5. Result: Dead straight drives

**Diagnosis - Nate's Case** (Video 15):
- Occasional hooks (2-3 per 14 drives)
- High, extended finish
- 5° right path with face closing inconsistently

**Fix: Lower Finish** (Video 15)
- Focus on finishing lower and more around body
- Colin Morikawa principle: Low finish = fade/straight
- Alignment stick as "virtual ceiling"
- Path: 5° right to 0.2° right
- Eliminated hooks completely

### Early Extension (Video 9)

**Definition:**
- Moving away from vertical line behind butt
- Getting closer to ball during downswing
- Lifting out of posture

**Consequences:**
- Inconsistent strike quality
- Loss of directional control
- Significant power loss

**The Root Cause Chain:**
- Steep downswing → Early extension compensation
- Without compensation: Severe pull patterns and steeper contact
- Fix causes (setup, backswing), not symptom (extension)

**Fix #1: Setup Posture**
- Hips over ankle joint (not far behind)
- Start tall, hinge from hip joint
- Soften legs (don't over-bend)
- Weight through middle of feet
- Devon's case: Setup alone almost eliminated extension

**Fix #2: Arm Depth in Backswing**
- Get arms more around body
- Club on ground visual drill (30-40° angle)
- Should see club above arm at top
- Proper depth prevents steep downswing

**Fix #3: Close-Standing Drill**
- Move 2 inches closer to ball
- Forces body to move away (opposite of extension)
- Shanks occur if you extend forward
- "Torture it in practice" - use on range
- Transfer feeling to normal distance

**Devon's Results:**
- Changed only setup posture
- Early extension almost completely disappeared
- More upright, less knee bend
- Hips closer to over ankles

### Chicken Wing / Head Drop Pattern (Video 3)

**Diagnosis:**
- Elbows flare apart through impact
- Left arm bends (chicken wing)
- Head drops 2+ inches in downswing
- Results: Fat shots and thin shots
- Inconsistent contact despite good body movement

**The Relationship:**
- Chicken wing shortens swing radius
- Body must drop to compensate and reach ball
- It's arms causing head drop, not vice versa

**Physical Screening:**
- 90/90 test: Passed
- Lat length test: Passed
- Not a mobility issue
- Swing pattern problem

**Fix: Set to Point Drill**
- Short backswing (waist high)
- Focus on keeping elbows CLOSE TOGETHER
- Short follow-through (waist high)
- Feel squeezing elbows through impact
- Keep body rotation active
- Maintain club speed

**Success Markers:**
- Tee stays in ground
- Divot starts AFTER ball (1 inch after)
- Crisp, compressed contact
- Lower ball flight (correct for drill)

**Dan's Results:**
- Immediate improvement in same session
- Fat/thin eliminated
- Divot after ball consistently
- Pure strikes with proper arm extension

### Inconsistent Driver Contact - Heel Strikes (Videos 7, 10, 12)

**Cause #1: Ball Position** (Video 7)
- Ball too far back creates iron setup
- Face arrives open at impact
- Path and setup don't match club

**Fix:**
- Move ball to left heel position
- Creates proper driver setup
- Spine tilt away from target
- Allows face time to square

**Cause #2: Poor Posture** (Video 7)
- Weight on heels at setup
- Butt pushed too far back
- Forces forward movement (early extension)
- Moves center 5-6 inches toward ball

**Fix:**
- Hips over ankles
- Weight through middle of feet
- Taller, more athletic posture
- Balance test: Can resist being pushed

**Cause #3: Disconnected Takeaway** (Video 12)
- Arms separate from body going back
- Club above plane
- Compensating loop brings club forward
- Pokes into heel

**Fix:**
- Connected takeaway
- Wider stance prevents disconnection
- Arms stay close to body
- Victor: Zero heel strikes in 8 shots

**Cause #4: Persistent Pattern** (Video 10)
- Even with good path, heel contact continues
- Old habit persisting

**Fix:**
- Address ball at TOE of club
- Actively try to hit off toe
- Ball migrates to center
- Chris: Best shot (275 yards) using toe setup

### Hooks and Blocks (Video 11, Video 15)

**The "Slider" Pattern** (Video 11)
- Too much lateral movement
- Club gets stuck behind and under plane
- Path too much from inside (5-7° right)
- Ball blocks right or hooks left
- Common with injury history

**Fix for Sliders:**
- Fire oblique abdominals from top
- Turn trunk early
- Stabilizes lower body
- Stops excessive leg drive
- Feel: "Fire core, stabilize legs"

**High Finish Hooks** (Video 15)
- Club extends away from body
- High, reaching finish
- Allows hands to become active
- 5° right path + closing face = hooks

**Fix: Lower Finish**
- Finish lower and more around body
- Colin Morikawa principle
- Alignment stick as ceiling
- Chip swings first, build to full
- Nate: 5° right to 0.2° right path

## Practice Methodology

### Launch Monitor Training Philosophy

**Essential for These Fixes:**
- Ball position and fade feel calibration (Video 14)
- Clubface angle adjustments (Videos 4, 5)
- Path corrections (Videos 1, 5, 10)
- Distance control (Video 6)

**What to Monitor:**
- Club path (target ranges for different patterns)
- Face angle relative to path
- Attack angle (driver vs irons)
- Strike location on face
- Ball speed and carry distance
- Spin rates (wedges especially)

**Calibration Process:**
1. Establish baseline numbers
2. Make adjustment
3. Immediate feedback
4. Repeat until pattern locked
5. Compare feel to reality

**Feel vs. Real Development:**
- What you feel ≠ what you're doing
- Michael's "fade feel" = slight draw reality (Video 14)
- Chris needed to feel "extreme" for neutral (Video 10)
- Launch monitor reveals the truth

### Progressive Difficulty Strategy

**The Build-Up Approach (Video 15):**
1. Rehearsals with no ball
2. No backswing, just through-swing
3. Chip swings (50 yards)
4. 70% effort (220 yards)
5. Full effort with exaggeration
6. Full effort with normal feel

**Why This Works:**
- Immediate improvement with simple version
- Builds confidence before adding complexity
- Each level proves concept before progression
- Reduces anxiety about "getting it wrong"

**Nate's Results:**
- Chip swing: 5° to 0.3° right (immediate proof)
- 70% effort: Maintained improvement
- Full speed: 0.2°, 0.4°, 0.5° paths
- Total transformation in single session

### The Exaggeration Principle

**Core Concept:**
To fix ingrained pattern, must feel EXTREME opposite

**Examples:**
- Chris (Video 10): Feel "extremely uncomfortable" for neutral
- Danny (Video 4): Exaggerate closing face to eliminate blocks
- Michael (Video 14): Feel "fade" to produce straight
- Nate (Video 15): Exaggerate low finish to straighten path

**The Pattern:**
1. Old pattern deeply ingrained
2. "Normal" correction feels like no change
3. Exaggerated correction feels wrong but produces correct
4. Eventually exaggeration becomes new normal
5. Dial back once pattern locked

**Implementation:**
- Don't judge drill after 3 shots
- Commit to exaggeration for 10-15 swings
- Accept initial poor results (hooks, etc.)
- Trust the process and data
- Gradual refinement once basic change achieved

### Home Practice vs Range Practice

**Home Practice (No Ball Required):**
- Grip building (Video 13) - 5 minutes daily
- Turn-shift-turn body motion (Video 13) - 5 minutes daily
- Clubface rotation with paddle (Video 13)
- Position checks in mirror (Video 4)
- Width rehearsals (Video 1)
- Connected takeaway practice (Video 12)

**Benefits:**
- Builds muscle memory without performance anxiety
- Can practice daily without driving to range
- Focus purely on movement quality
- No ball flight to cause frustration

**Range Practice Structure:**

**Warm-Up (10 minutes):**
- 5-10 rehearsal swings for day's focus
- Progressive speed building
- Muscle activation

**Drill Work (30 minutes):**
- 80% of session on specific drill
- Use training aids
- Launch monitor feedback
- Focus on quality, not quantity

**Integration (10 minutes):**
- Reduce drill exaggeration
- Blend correction into normal swing
- Build confidence for course

**Cool-Down (10 minutes):**
- Random target practice
- Visualize on-course situations
- End on positive note

### The 80/20 Practice Prescription

**Width Drill Example (Video 1):**
- 80% of drives should use stop drill
- Continue for TWO MONTHS minimum
- Don't rush to hit without stopping
- Longer than you think necessary

**Why This Works:**
- Patterns take time to replace old habits
- 80/20 ensures new pattern dominates
- Prevents reverting under pressure
- Creates subconscious change

**Applied to Other Fixes:**
- Clubface drills: 80% of range balls for 2 weeks
- Finish position: 80% of swings with exaggeration for 1 month
- Connected takeaway: Rehearsal before every shot for 2 months

### Video Analysis Methodology

**Comparison Method (Video 10):**
1. Save original swing (baseline)
2. Capture drill/fix version
3. Capture full swing with new pattern
4. Show all side-by-side
5. Use as reference going forward

**Key Checkpoints from Down-the-Line:**
- Swing plane lines (Video 1, 10)
- Club position at parallel (Video 12)
- Impact line (Video 3)
- Finish height (Video 15)

**Key Checkpoints from Front:**
- Elbow gap at address vs impact (Video 3)
- Head height through swing (Video 3)
- Hip-ankle alignment (Video 9)
- Weight distribution (Video 9)

**Self-Coaching Capability:**
- "You got to know the difference when you do these swings now, cuz then you can coach yourself" (Video 12)
- Once you know feeling of correct vs incorrect
- Can diagnose and fix mid-round
- Video confirms what you're feeling

### Russell Henley's Practice System (Video 6)

**Distance Matrix Creation:**
1. Choose 3 wedges (lob, sand, gap)
2. For each wedge, establish 3-4 yardages in 5-yard increments
3. Practice each distance with 10-ball sets
4. Use Jim McLean immediate feedback drill
5. Create personal yardage chart

**Example Matrix:**
- Lob wedge: 65, 70, 75, 80 yards
- Sand wedge: 80, 85, 90, 95, 100 yards
- Gap wedge: 100, 105, 110, 115, 120 yards
- Complete coverage with owned distances

**Weekly Practice:**
- 1 session: Pure distance calibration (all distances)
- 1 session: Trajectory control (same distance, different heights)
- 1 session: Lie variations (rough, slopes, etc.)
- 1 session: Course simulation (random distances/lies)

**The "Choke Down Everything" Rule:**
- Non-negotiable in practice and on course
- 1 inch on all wedge shots
- Creates consistency Russell relies on
- 10,000+ RPM spin every shot

### Pattern Recognition and Management

**Identify YOUR Tendency (Video 11):**
1. Map 10 shots relative to target
2. Left side of course = Twister (need lateral)
3. Right side of course = Slider (need rotation)
4. Middle with occasional misses = Fine-tune specific areas

**Two Approaches:**

**Option A: Manage Your Pattern**
- Play from your side of course
- Work to minimize tendency
- Easier, less time-intensive
- Acceptance of natural pattern
- Example: Tour player could "just manage" pattern (Video 15)

**Option B: Change Your Pattern**
- Commit to overhaul
- More time and effort
- May be necessary for serious improvement
- Requires months of dedicated practice
- Example: Chris's path change 5.7° left to 0.6° right (Video 10)

**When to Choose Change:**
- Two-way miss (can't manage both directions)
- Pattern causes injury or strain
- Consistency critical for goals
- Willing to invest time required

### On-Course Application

**Pre-Shot Routine Development:**

**For Driver:**
1. Stand behind, visualize desired shot
2. One rehearsal swing with day's focus feel
3. Step to ball immediately
4. Execute with same feel

**For Irons:**
1. Check lie and distance
2. Rehearsal swing with connected takeaway feel
3. Step to ball
4. Focus: Turn-shift-turn with ball-first contact

**For Wedges (Russell's System):**
1. Assess yardage
2. Pick nearest "owned" distance (5-yard increment)
3. Visualize trajectory and landing spot
4. Consider next shot (putting position)
5. Choke down 1 inch
6. Execute familiar swing length

**Mid-Round Adjustments:**

**If Slice Returns:**
- Check: Width at top (Video 1)
- Check: Arms staying connected (Video 12)
- One exaggerated practice swing
- Trust the correction

**If Hooks Appear:**
- Check: Finish height (Video 15)
- Check: Face angle at waist-high (Video 4)
- One low finish rehearsal
- Execute with "fade feel"

**If Contact Inconsistent:**
- Check: Weight distribution (Video 9)
- Check: Distance from ball (Video 9)
- Ground contact rehearsal (no ball)
- Focus: Ball first, ground second

## Conclusion

This master reference guide combines 15 videos of Me and My Golf instruction into a comprehensive, organized resource. The channel's unique strength lies in:

1. **TPI Biomechanics Partnership** - Scientific foundation from thousands of 3D motion capture analyses
2. **Launch Monitor Integration** - Objective data confirming every fix
3. **Tour-Level Insights** - Russell Henley's #1-ranked wedge system, Colin Morikawa references
4. **Root Cause Diagnosis** - Fixing upstream problems to eliminate downstream symptoms
5. **Progressive Drill Sequences** - From simple rehearsals to full-speed integration
6. **Individual Pattern Recognition** - Customized solutions based on YOUR tendency

**The Fundamental Truth:**
Every lesson emphasizes fixing causes, not symptoms. Early extension is caused by steep backswing. Head drop is caused by arm extension loss. Blocks are caused by open clubface at waist-high. Over-the-top is caused by narrow arms or disconnected takeaway.

**The Practice Philosophy:**
80% drill work for months, exaggerate the correction until it feels wrong (because it's right), use launch monitor to calibrate feel vs. reality, practice at home without ball, integrate gradually to full speed.

**The Results:**
- Chris: 5.7° left to 0.6° right path in one session (Video 10)
- Danny: Blocks eliminated with 3-5° face adjustment (Video 4)
- Victor: Zero heel strikes in 8 shots (Video 12)
- Michelle: 10 mph gain with same accuracy (Video 8)
- Nate: 5° right to 0.2° right path (Video 15)

This is data-driven, science-backed, tour-validated golf instruction made accessible to all levels. Use this guide as your complete reference for setup, swing mechanics, short game, and practice methodology.
