## DRIVER FAULTS

### SLICE (Right Curve, Weak Distance)

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Symptom** | Ball starts right or straight, curves right, weak distance |
| **Root Causes** | Open clubface at impact, over-the-top path, weak backswing, poor setup |
| **Video References** | 004, 005, 007, 010 |
| **Quick Fix** (Today) | Waist-high face position check: toe must point straight up or past vertical (Video 004). Feel "strong face" at this checkpoint. |
| **Longer Fix** (This Week) | Nuclear bag drill: hit toe-first into impact bag to close face aggressively (Video 004). Accept hooks initially—better than blocks. |
| **Long-Term Plan** (This Month) | Video 001: Width drill + stop at top; Video 010: Exaggerated backswing plane feeling (feel too flat/inside); Video 011: Add lateral bump to downswing to shallow club automatically |

---

### HOOK (Left Curve, Inconsistent)

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Symptom** | Ball starts right but hooks hard left (occasionally) OR consistent left misses |
| **Root Causes** | Face closing too much too early, over-sliding lower body, extended finish position, forward ball position |
| **Video References** | 011, 014, 015 |
| **Quick Fix** (Today) | Move ball back 3-4 inches in stance (Video 014). This prevents face from closing at worst time. Accept hitting farther right initially. |
| **Longer Fix** (This Week) | Video 015: Alignment stick drill—physical constraint forcing lower, more rotational finish (not high and extended) |
| **Long-Term Plan** (This Month) | Video 011: Fire obliques from top of swing to stabilize over-sliding lower body. Video 015: Feel "fade" to neutralize inside-out path; finish low/left, not high/out |

---

### BLOCKS RIGHT

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Symptom** | Ball starts right and stays right, no curve, pushes |
| **Root Causes** | Club path is right, body stalls during swing, open clubface |
| **Video References** | 004, 010 |
| **Quick Fix** (Today) | Check club path at waist-high: leading edge should point forward (not back/up). Get toe of club past vertical. Feel like heel is "winning the race" to the ball = stall problem. |
| **Longer Fix** (This Week) | Video 004: Toe-first bag drill to close face. Video 010: Toe address position (address ball at toe of club, actively try to hit off toe) |
| **Long-Term Plan** (This Month) | Get face square/closed before impact. Video 004: Must feel "strong" face at waist-high. Practice 80% of drives with bag drill until face closure becomes automatic. |

---

### INCONSISTENCY (Both Left & Right Misses)

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Symptom** | Two-way miss: sometimes hooks, sometimes slices; unpredictable |
| **Root Causes** | Ball position too far forward (face closing at wrong time), setup issues, takeaway problems |
| **Video References** | 014, 001, 012 |
| **Quick Fix** (Today) | Check ball position: move back to inside left foot (not opposite big toe). This creates predictable baseline. |
| **Longer Fix** (This Week) | Video 001: Width drill—arms must stay wide at top, not collapse. Video 012: Connected takeaway (arms don't disconnect from body) |
| **Long-Term Plan** (This Month) | Video 001: 80% of drives should use stop-at-top drill for 2 months. Video 012: Setup fixes (wider stance, balanced weight through middle of feet) eliminate inconsistency from ground up. |

---

### WEAK DISTANCE (Low Clubhead Speed)

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Symptom** | Hitting it straight but not far enough; feels like half power |
| **Root Causes** | Slow backswing, controlled takeaway (arm-only), weak body engagement |
| **Video References** | 008 |
| **Quick Fix** (Today) | Make 5 practice swings with fast backswing—fling club back using full body (arms, hips, legs, core). Don't worry about control. |
| **Longer Fix** (This Week) | Video 008: Resistance drill (partner blocks club to feel full-body engagement). Then speed practice swings (fast backswing with no ball). |
| **Long-Term Plan** (This Month) | Video 008: Test last 10 drives on range with fast backswing vs. first 10 with slow/controlled. Should gain 5-12 mph and same or better accuracy. Warm up thoroughly (10 min) before speed work. |

---

## IRON FAULTS

### FAT SHOTS (Hitting Ground Before Ball)

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Symptom** | Club strikes ground 1-2 inches before ball; weak distance; inconsistent contact |
| **Root Causes** | Head drop due to flaring elbows (chicken wing), early extension, shallow angle |
| **Video References** | 003, 009 |
| **Quick Fix** (Today) | Video 003: Set to Point drill—short backswing, SQUEEZE elbows together through impact, short follow-through (waist-high). Use tee. |
| **Longer Fix** (This Week) | Video 009: Setup posture check—hips over ankles, weight through middle of feet (not heels). Tricep line test: should pass slightly in front of knees and through toes. |
| **Long-Term Plan** (This Month) | Video 003: 80% of practice should use Set to Point drill (2-3 weeks minimum). Week 4: gradually lengthen swing while maintaining "squeeze elbows" feel. Video 009: Fix setup first (foundation), then arm extension becomes automatic. |

---

### THIN SHOTS (Hitting Ball on Lower Portion of Clubface)

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Symptom** | Ball flies low, often long, inconsistent height |
| **Root Causes** | Same as fat shots: head drop + flaring elbows, OR improper impact line |
| **Video References** | 003, 009 |
| **Quick Fix** (Today) | Same as fat shots: Video 003 Set to Point drill with tee. Head height/arm extension correction fixes both fat and thin. |
| **Longer Fix** (This Week) | Video 009: Close-standing drill (2 inches closer than normal) forces proper spacing through impact. Will feel like shank position initially—correct. |
| **Long-Term Plan** (This Month) | Video 003 + 009 combined: Fix setup + practice Set to Point + use close-standing drill = both fat and thin eliminated within 2-3 weeks |

---

### SHANK (Hitting Hosel, Ball Flies Right)

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Symptom** | Ball comes off hosel and shoots right; embarrassing |
| **Root Causes** | Takeaway arms disconnect from body (pushed out), stance too narrow, weight on toes |
| **Video References** | 012 |
| **Quick Fix** (Today) | Video 012: Blue line drill—take address and practice backswing keeping arms UNDER a horizontal line (train connected takeaway). |
| **Longer Fix** (This Week) | Video 012: Setup fixes—wider stance (outside heels just wider than hips), weight through middle of feet (not toes). Parallel checkpoint: when shaft is parallel to ground, it should also be parallel to target line. |
| **Long-Term Plan** (This Month) | Video 012: 2 weeks on setup fixes + blue line drill (20 reps daily). Week 3: on-plane checkpoint rehearsal before every shot. Week 4: self-coaching—immediately recognize when arms disconnect. |

---

### HEEL STRIKE (Hitting Hosel Side, Weak/Unpredictable)

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Symptom** | Ball comes off heel of club; weak, erratic distance |
| **Root Causes** | Takeaway disconnection, early extension, standing too far from ball, standing too close to ball |
| **Video References** | 007, 010, 012 |
| **Quick Fix** (Today) | Video 007: Check ball position and posture. Hips should be over ankles (not way back). Feel taller, more athletic. This immediately improves strike location. |
| **Longer Fix** (This Week) | Video 012: Connected takeaway training (arms stay close to body). If persisting with good path, Video 010: Use headcover drill or address ball at toe of club. |
| **Long-Term Plan** (This Month) | Video 012 foundation (setup + connected takeaway) fixes most heel strikes. If path is good but heel persists, Video 010: toe address position (last resort adjustment). |

---

### INCONSISTENT CONTACT (Mix of Pure, Fat, Thin, Heel Strikes)

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Symptom** | One shot pure, next one off heel or fat; can't trust contact |
| **Root Causes** | Takeaway disconnection (requires perfect compensation timing), setup instability |
| **Video References** | 012 |
| **Quick Fix** (Today) | Video 012: Connected takeaway drill (blue line). Arms must stay under/inside throughout takeaway—no pushing outward. |
| **Longer Fix** (This Week) | Video 012: Setup sequence (weight, stance width), then on-plane checkpoint at parallel position (shaft parallel to ground AND target line). |
| **Long-Term Plan** (This Month) | Video 012 is THE fix for inconsistency. Focus entirely on connected takeaway + setup. Once connected, body figure out compensation—makes swing consistent automatically. Result: zero heel strikes in just 8 shots after fix. |

---

## UNIVERSAL FAULTS

### EARLY EXTENSION (Hips Thrust Forward, Posture Lost)

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Symptom** | Moving closer to ball during downswing; loss of posture; inconsistent strikes |
| **Root Causes** | Setup (butt too far back, weight on heels), arms too upright in backswing (steep downswing), standing too far from ball |
| **Video References** | 007, 009 |
| **Quick Fix** (Today) | Video 009: Posture check. Draw line behind butt at setup—should be about 1 clubhead width behind heels (not multiple widths). |
| **Longer Fix** (This Week) | Video 009: Tricep line test—vertical line down back of tricep should pass slightly in front of knees and through toes. This is THE critical checkpoint. |
| **Long-Term Plan** (This Month) | Video 009: 3 fixes: (1) Setup posture (hips over ankles, soften knees), (2) Arm depth in backswing (club visible above arm at top), (3) Close-standing drill (2 inches closer to force space creation). |

---

### OVER THE TOP (Out-to-In Path, Slices/Pulls)

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Symptom** | Club approaches from outside; starts left or slices; inconsistent direction |
| **Root Causes** | Backswing plane above plane, flat shoulders at top, missing lateral force component |
| **Video References** | 005, 010, 011 |
| **Quick Fix** (Today) | Video 010: Practice swing—club wraps AROUND body (feel too flat/inside). Feel right shoulder moves DOWN (steeper tilt). Do this as practice swing before every shot. |
| **Longer Fix** (This Week) | Video 011: Add lateral bump/shift to start downswing. Feel "spreading ground apart" rather than rotating first. Don't worry about rotation—it will happen naturally. |
| **Long-Term Plan** (This Month) | Video 010: Stop-at-top drill focusing on backswing plane (club on plane, shoulders tilted). Video 011: Justin Rose drill—shift hips forward, drop arms down, keep back facing target. |

---

### STUCK (Club Gets Behind Body, Blocks/Hooks)

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Symptom** | Club behind hands, blocks right OR hooks left; limited power; feels trapped |
| **Root Causes** | Over-sliding lower body, too much lateral without rotation, sway away from target on backswing |
| **Video References** | 014, 011 |
| **Quick Fix** (Today) | Video 011: Fire obliques/core rotation from top of swing. This stops excessive lateral sliding automatically and unsticks the club. |
| **Longer Fix** (This Week) | Video 014: Ball position back (inside left foot) prevents getting too stuck. Club earlier in arc = less closure = less block/hook. |
| **Long-Term Plan** (This Month) | Video 011: Identify if you're a "slider" (over-lateral, getting stuck). The fix: trunk rotation from top. Feel obligues firing, not legs driving. Build this into regular practice. |

## DECISION TREES

### "I SLICE THE DRIVER"

```
Start: Do you slice every shot or inconsistently?

├─ EVERY SHOT
│  └─ Quick Diagnosis:
│     • Check waist-high face position (Video 004)
│     • Is leading edge pointing backward? YES → Face is too open
│     └─ FIX: Video 004 Waist-high position check + bag drill
│
└─ INCONSISTENT (Sometimes slice, sometimes pull/hook)
   └─ Quick Diagnosis:
      • Check ball position—is it opposite left big toe? YES → Too forward
      • Check swing plane—is club above plane at top? YES → Over-the-top setup
      └─ FIX: Video 001 Width drill OR Video 010 Exaggerated plane feel OR Video 005 Drag-Push-Toe combo
```

### "I HOOK THE DRIVER"

```
Start: Do you hook every shot or inconsistently?

├─ OCCASIONAL HOOK (Most drives OK, 2-3 per round)
│  └─ Quick Diagnosis:
│     • Check finish position—is it high and extended? YES → Over-extended finish
│     └─ FIX: Video 015 Alignment stick drill (lower finish)
│
├─ FREQUENT HOOKS WITH BLOCKS
│  └─ Quick Diagnosis:
│     • Do you have 5° right path with closed face? YES → Ball too far forward
│     └─ FIX: Video 014 Move ball back 3-4 inches, then Video 015 lower finish
│
└─ STUCK CLUB (Behind hands)
   └─ Quick Diagnosis:
      • Do you slide toward target too much? YES → Over-slider
      └─ FIX: Video 011 Fire obliques from top to stop the slide
```

### "MY IRONS ARE INCONSISTENT"

```
Start: What's your most common miss?

├─ MOSTLY FAT (Ground before ball)
│  └─ FIX: Video 003 Set to Point drill (focus on elbow squeeze)
│     + Video 009 posture fix (hips over ankles)
│
├─ MOSTLY THIN
│  └─ FIX: Same as fat—same root cause (head drop)
│     Video 003 + Video 009 together solve both
│
├─ MOSTLY SHANK
│  └─ FIX: Video 012 Connected takeaway
│     Check: Arms don't push outward on takeaway
│
├─ MOSTLY HEEL STRIKE
│  └─ FIX: Video 012 if inconsistent
│     Video 010 toe address if path is good but heel persists
│
└─ MIX OF ALL ABOVE (Truly inconsistent)
   └─ FIX: Video 012 Connected takeaway + setup
      This is the foundation—fix this first
```

### Week 2: Build the Feel
- Primary drill 20 minutes, 3-4x per week
- Practice without ball first
- Use mirrors/video for feedback

### Week 3: Integration
- Primary drill with ball (50 balls)
- Mix with normal swings (70/30 ratio)
- Track one metric (path, face, contact location)

### Week 4+: Maintenance
- Primary drill warm-up only (5-10 minutes)
- Gradually shift to full practice
- Can return to intensive practice if fault reappears

## KEY COACHING PRINCIPLES FROM ME AND MY GOLF

### Fix the Cause, Not the Symptom
- **Example:** Don't fix the slice (symptom); fix the open face or path (cause)
- **Example:** Don't force your butt back (fighting symptom); fix setup posture (cause)

### Exaggeration Produces Correctness
- To fix ingrained patterns, feel the EXTREME opposite
- "Too much feel" = correct reality (feels are often reversed)

### Setup Fixes More Than Swing Changes
- Better posture (Video 009) eliminates early extension without conscious thought
- Proper grip foundation (Video 013) enables better mechanics automatically
- Correct ball position (Video 014) changes paths without swing feeling different

### Small Changes = Big Results
- Moving ball back 3-4 inches (Video 014) eliminates hooks entirely
- Lowering finish (Video 015) changes path 5° in one drill
- Squeezing elbows (Video 003) fixes fat shots immediately

### One Thing at a Time
- Pick ONE primary fault to fix per month
- Master foundation before attempting advanced fixes
- Single focus produces faster results than multiple changes

---

## WHEN TO SEEK PROFESSIONAL HELP

### Red Flags for Expert Assessment
- Multiple faults in one swing (path + face + plane + sequencing issues)
- No improvement after 2 weeks of focused drilling
- Compensations upon compensations (fixing one thing creates another fault)
- Pain or injury limitations affecting swing
- Unable to self-diagnose using decision trees

### Good Launch Monitor Data to Have
- Club path (target: -2° to +3° for most clubs)
- Club face angle relative to path (determines curve)
- Attack angle (determines distance, launch)
- Strike location (should be center/heel, not toe/high/low)
- Spin rate (determines flight characteristics)

---

## FINAL CHECKLIST: BEFORE YOU PRACTICE

- [ ] Identified your primary fault using decision trees
- [ ] Watched recommended video at least once
- [ ] Performed "Quick Fix" drill (confirms diagnosis)
- [ ] Set realistic practice timeline (2-4 weeks minimum)
- [ ] Have mirror, camera, or launch monitor for feedback
- [ ] Committed to ONE drill focus (not multiple changes)
- [ ] Ready to feel things "wrong" initially (exaggeration principle)

**Remember:** The fastest path to improvement is fixing one thing completely, not partially fixing everything.
