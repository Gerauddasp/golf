## Introduction: The Iron Striking Challenge {#introduction}

Iron play separates good golfers from great ones. While drivers get the attention, pure iron striking is what scores well. This comprehensive system addresses the most common iron striking problems:

- **Inconsistent contact** (fat, thin, heel, toe)
- **Loss of distance** despite good swing speed
- **Poor trajectory control**
- **Inability to take proper divots**

This guide synthesizes insights from:
- **TPI's 3D biomechanical research** on driver vs iron differences
- **Live coaching sessions** showing real-world problem-solving
- **Fundamental principles** for building solid foundations

**Key Philosophy**: Diagnose the root cause first, then apply the appropriate fix. Most visible faults are symptoms of deeper issues.

## Iron Setup vs Driver Setup {#setup-differences}

### The Critical Truth: Different Clubs Require Different Setups

**TPI Research Finding**: Amateur golfers' biggest mistake is making their iron and driver setups look the same. Professional patterns show that setup differences are AMPLIFIED at impact, not reduced.

### Iron Setup Fundamentals

**Ball Position**
- More centered in stance (varies by club length)
- 7-iron: Just forward of center
- Shorter irons: More centered
- Longer irons: Slightly more forward

**Spine Angle**
- More neutral (less secondary axis tilt than driver)
- Spine tilts forward from hips, not away from target
- Creates conditions for descending strike

**Weight Distribution**
- More even at address (50-50 or slight lead side bias)
- NOT back-weighted like driver
- Critical: Weight through the laces, NOT on toes

**Stance Width**
- Narrower than driver but NOT too narrow
- Outside of heels just wider than hips
- Wide enough to engage legs properly
- Common mistake: "Pitch shot" stance is too narrow

**Hand Position**
- Hands ahead of ball at address
- Creates forward shaft lean
- Sets up proper descending delivery

**Visual Checkpoint**
- Setup "stack" is more aligned (shoulders, hips, hands, ball)
- Less axis tilt than driver
- More forward-leaning posture

### Driver Setup Comparison (What NOT to Do with Irons)

**Driver Setup Characteristics:**
- Ball forward (off lead heel or ahead)
- Spine tilted away from target (secondary axis tilt)
- Weight 55-60% on trail side
- Wider stance
- Shoulders tilted to match spine

**Why This Matters**: If your iron setup looks like your driver setup, you'll hang back and flip through impact. If your driver setup looks like your iron setup, you'll hit down on the driver and lose distance.

### Weight Distribution Deep Dive

**The Toe Problem**
Many golfers unknowingly set up with too much weight on their toes. This creates:
- Instability throughout swing
- Early extension tendency
- Difficulty rotating through impact
- Heel strikes and inconsistent contact

**The Fix: Weight Balance Drill**
1. Place middle of feet on alignment stick
2. Rock all the way onto toes - feel it (wrong)
3. Rock all the way onto heels - feel it (also wrong)
4. Find middle ground - weight through laces area
5. Should feel "ready to do squats"
6. Athletic, grounded position

**Success Marker**: If someone lightly pushed you from any direction, you'd be stable and balanced.

## The Connected Takeaway {#takeaway}

### The Problem: Disconnected Arms

**The Fault Pattern:**
- Hands move away from body (outward) on takeaway
- Arms separate from torso too early
- Club pushes above the swing plane
- Hands move in front of vertical reference line
- Club gets "laid off" at top

**Why It Destroys Iron Contact:**
- Requires compensating "loop" move on downswing
- Inconsistent timing = inconsistent contact
- When compensation fails, club pokes forward = heel strikes/shanks
- Creates early extension through impact
- Makes proper rotation difficult

**Real-World Example**: Victor's case study showed great body motion but inconsistent strikes. Root cause: disconnected takeaway forcing compensations. After fix: zero heel strikes and effortless power.

### The Solution: Connected Takeaway

**Key Principle**: Arms and body work together as ONE UNIT during takeaway.

**The Feel:**
- "Arms stay super close underneath reference line"
- No separation between arms and torso
- Feels like "I'm not moving anything - club is just there"
- Students describe it as "effortless"

**The Movement:**
1. From proper setup (wide stance, balanced weight)
2. Arms stay connected to body throughout takeaway
3. Hands move inside/under (not away from body)
4. Club stays on or slightly under swing plane
5. No pushing outward with hands/arms

### The On-Plane Checkpoint

**Critical Reference Point**: When club reaches parallel to ground in backswing

**How to Know You're On Plane:**
- Shaft should be parallel to target line (not just parallel to ground)
- **Too far inside** = shaft points right of target
- **Too far outside** = shaft points left of target (disconnected)
- **On plane** = shaft parallel to both ground AND target line

**Practice Method:**
1. Take proper address
2. Move club back slowly keeping arms connected
3. Stop at parallel position
4. CHECK: Shaft parallel to ground AND target line?
5. Hold for 2 seconds, ingrain the feel
6. Complete backswing maintaining plane

### Setup Prerequisites for Connected Takeaway

**Stance Width (Critical)**
- Outside of heels just wider than hips
- Significantly wider than pitch shot stance
- Why it works: Wider stance naturally prevents arm disconnection
- Engages legs for proper rotation
- Creates stability for consistent contact

**Weight Distribution (Essential)**
- Balanced front-to-back (not toe-heavy)
- Weight through laces area
- Athletic, grounded feeling
- "Strong legs" ready to use ground force

**Key Insight**: Proper stance width doesn't just help - it physically prevents the disconnecting arm move. Students report: "This stance doesn't allow you to take it out like I used to."

## Swing Sequence for Irons {#swing-sequence}

### The Turn-Shift-Turn Pattern

**Basic Concept**: How your body moves shapes how the club moves.

**Three-Part Motion:**
1. **Backswing - TURN**: Pure rotation, no lateral movement
2. **Downswing - SHIFT**: Lateral movement toward target
3. **Through-Swing - TURN**: Rotation through impact to finish

### Backswing: Pure Rotation

**What It Is:**
- Turn chest and hips together
- NO lateral movement away from target
- Arms stay connected to body
- More compact than driver (less behind the ball)

**TPI 3D Data:**
- Less lateral movement than driver
- Weight stays more centered (60-70% trail foot maximum vs 80-90% for driver)
- Lower hands position than driver
- More forward shaft lean maintained throughout

**The Feel:**
- Coiling into trail side
- Loading with rotation, not sway
- Maintaining center of mass over feet
- Arms and body moving together

### Downswing: The Critical Shift

**What It Is:**
- Early pressure shift to lead side
- Lateral movement toward target
- Sets up proper descending delivery

**Iron-Specific Characteristics:**
- More forward body motion than driver
- Lead side straightens earlier
- Steeper shaft delivery
- Weight moves forward through impact

**Ground Force Pattern:**
- Similar lead side shift to driver but different timing
- More rotational force (less vertical than driver)
- Maximum force closer to impact (not before like driver)
- More linear force toward target

**The Contrast:**
- **Driver**: "Stay back and swing up"
- **Irons**: "Move forward and swing down"

**Critical Understanding**: The shift isn't just weight transfer - it's positioning your body to deliver the club on a descending path for ball-first contact.

### Through-Swing: Complete Rotation

**What It Is:**
- Rotation through impact
- Finish facing target
- Weight fully on front leg

**Success Markers:**
- All weight on front leg at finish
- Back foot released up onto toe
- Hips and chest facing target
- Lead leg straight (posted up)
- Arms extending down target line

**TPI Insight**: At impact, irons require forward position with body stacked over lead side and hands ahead of ball. This is dramatically different from driver impact.

### The Compact Nature of Iron Swings

**Compared to Driver:**
- More compact turn
- Less lateral movement
- Less "behind the ball" shift
- Promotes steeper attack angle
- More centered pivot

**Why This Matters**: The more centered pivot in the iron backswing sets up proper descending delivery. If you make the same big turn you do with driver, you'll struggle with ball-first contact.

## Strike Quality: Ball-First Contact {#strike-quality}

### The Arm Extension Principle

**The Problem: Chicken Wing**

**What It Is:**
- Left arm (lead arm) bends through impact
- Elbow flares out and away from body
- Often accompanied by right elbow flaring as well
- Creates "chicken wing" appearance

**Why It Destroys Contact:**
- Shortens swing radius
- When elbows separate, club pulls into body
- Ball is fixed distance from body
- If radius shortens, something must compensate
- Usually: head/body drops to reach ball
- Result: Inconsistent contact (fat and thin)

**The Physics:**
- Elbows close together = longer swing radius
- Elbows flaring apart = shorter swing radius
- Just 2 inches of head drop makes difference between fat and pure

**Real-World Example**: Dan's case study showed excellent body motion but chicken wing through impact. Head dropped 2+ inches to compensate. After fixing arm extension: immediate pure contact with divots after ball.

### The Set to Point Solution

**What It Teaches:**
- Proper arm extension through impact
- Eliminates chicken wing pattern
- Maintains swing radius
- Allows proper body rotation

**The Key Feel:**
- "Squeeze elbows together" through impact
- Arms extending down target line
- No separation between elbows
- Body still rotating (not arms-only move)

**Critical Understanding**: The head drop is a COMPENSATION for shortened arms. Fix the arms first, and the head will naturally stop dropping as much.

### Arm Extension vs Body Rotation

**Common Concern**: "Won't extending arms while body rotates cause blocks?"

**Answer**: Arms extending and body rotating work TOGETHER, not independently.

**Proper Integration:**
- Arms extend down target line
- Body rotates through impact simultaneously
- Arms stay connected to rotating body
- No separation between arm movement and body movement
- Creates effortless power

**What It's NOT:**
- Not an arms-only swing
- Not holding body still while arms work
- Not manipulating club with hands

## Ground Contact Principles {#ground-contact}

### The Ball-First Truth

**The Most Important Concept**: With irons, strike the ball FIRST, then hit the ground AFTER the ball.

**Common Misconception**: Many beginners think they should hit ground before ball.

**The Correct Sequence:**
1. Clubhead contacts ball
2. Clubhead continues forward
3. Clubhead strikes ground PAST ball position
4. Divot is taken AFTER the ball

**This is How Professionals Strike Irons**: Ball-first contact with divot past the ball position.

### Divot Patterns and What They Reveal

**Ideal Divot:**
- Starts at or just after ball position
- Extends 3-6 inches toward target
- Relatively shallow (not deep)
- Bacon strip, not chunk

**Divot Starting Before Ball:**
- Indicates low point is behind ball
- Causes fat shots (hitting ground first)
- Common with hanging back or early release

**No Divot:**
- May indicate thin contact
- Could indicate ascending blow (wrong for irons)
- Might suggest setup too much like driver

**Divot Too Deep:**
- Excessive steepness
- Often from casting or over-the-top move
- Wastes energy into ground, not ball

### Angle of Attack for Irons

**TPI Research:**
- Irons require negative angle of attack (descending)
- Typical tour player: -3 to -5 degrees with mid-irons
- This creates proper compression and spin
- Setup directly influences attack angle

**What Creates Descending Blow:**
- Proper iron setup (not driver setup)
- Forward weight shift through impact
- Ball position not too far forward
- Hands ahead of ball at impact
- Lead side posted up

**Launch Monitor Validation:**
- Angle of attack should be negative
- Launch angle comes from loft, not angle of attack
- Spin rate should be appropriate for club (6-iron: ~6000 rpm)
- Proper compression creates optimal ball flight

### The Low Point Control System

**Understanding Low Point:**
- The lowest point of your swing arc
- Should be PAST the ball with irons
- Controlled by weight distribution and pivot

**What Influences Low Point:**
1. **Weight Distribution**: Forward weight = low point forward
2. **Pivot Pattern**: Proper shift moves low point forward
3. **Hand Position**: Hands ahead keeps low point forward
4. **Setup**: Centered or forward ball position

**Practice Method:**
- Make swings without ball
- Focus on striking ground PAST where ball would be
- Use turn-shift-turn body motion
- Watch/feel where contact occurs
- Gradually add ball once pattern is consistent

## Common Iron Faults {#common-faults}

### 1. Heel Strikes and Shanks

**Symptoms:**
- Contact on heel of club
- Occasional full shanks (ball off hosel)
- One shot pure, next shot heel
- Inconsistent distance and direction

**Root Causes:**
- **Disconnected takeaway** (most common)
- Club pushes above plane
- Compensating loop brings club too far forward
- Early extension
- Jumping onto toes through impact

**Diagnosis:**
- Video from front: Watch elbows on takeaway
- Check if hands push away from body early
- Observe parallel checkpoint: Is shaft on plane?
- Note early extension and toe pressure at impact

**Fixes:**
- Connected takeaway (primary)
- Proper stance width
- Weight balance (not on toes)
- Blue line drill
- On-plane checkpoint rehearsal

**Case Study**: Victor went from inconsistent heel strikes/shanks to ZERO heel strikes in 8 shots after implementing connected takeaway with proper setup.

### 2. Fat Shots (Ground Before Ball)

**Symptoms:**
- Clubhead strikes ground before ball
- Heavy, chunked contact
- Loss of distance
- Divot before ball position

**Root Causes:**
- **Chicken wing** creating head drop
- Low point behind ball
- Hanging back on trail side
- Flipping at ball
- Early release of wrist angles

**Diagnosis:**
- Video from front: Watch head height through swing
- Check elbow gap at impact (flaring apart?)
- Note low point relative to ball
- Observe weight distribution at impact

**Fixes:**
- Set to Point drill (primary)
- Arm extension focus
- Forward weight shift
- Ground contact training
- Turn-shift-turn body motion

**Important**: When first practicing arm extension, you might hit a few fat shots as your body adjusts. This is temporary during pattern correction. Don't judge after 3 swings - give it 10-15 to adapt.

### 3. Thin Shots (Topped or Bladed)

**Symptoms:**
- Contact on equator or above
- Ball launches low and hot
- Minimal height
- Runs on landing

**Root Causes:**
- **Head dropping and then lifting**
- Trying to help ball up
- Hanging back and scooping
- Low point behind ball (hitting on upswing)
- Loss of posture through impact

**Often Related To:**
- Chicken wing (but head rises to compensate differently)
- Fear of fat shots creating opposite compensation
- Attempting to "stay down" too long then popping up

**Diagnosis:**
- Video from front: Track head through impact and follow-through
- Does head rise suddenly through impact?
- Is low point well behind ball?
- Check weight: Stuck on trail side?

**Fixes:**
- Same as fat shot fixes (often same root cause)
- Set to Point drill
- Focus on forward weight shift
- Maintain spine angle through impact
- Ground contact awareness training

### 4. Inconsistent Contact (Mixed Fat/Thin)

**Symptoms:**
- One shot fat, next shot thin
- Can't predict strike quality
- Frustrating inconsistency
- Sometimes pure, can't replicate

**Root Causes:**
- **Inconsistent low point** (most common)
- Variable head height through swing
- Inconsistent weight shift
- Disconnected takeaway requiring timing
- Chicken wing pattern

**Why This Happens:**
- When you have a compensation pattern, you must time it perfectly
- Sometimes compensation works (pure shot)
- Sometimes it doesn't (heel/fat/thin)
- Not a physical issue - it's a swing pattern issue

**Diagnosis:**
- Compare video of good shot vs bad shot
- Look for differences in:
  - Takeaway (disconnection?)
  - Head drop amount
  - Elbow gap at impact
  - Weight distribution at finish

**Fixes:**
- Connected takeaway (eliminates need for compensation)
- Set to Point drill (consistent arm extension)
- Turn-shift-turn body motion (repeatable pattern)
- Ground contact training (consistent low point)

**Key Insight**: Inconsistency usually means you're compensating for a faulty fundamental. Fix the fundamental and consistency improves dramatically.

### 5. Loss of Distance (Despite Good Contact)

**Symptoms:**
- Contact feels decent but distance is short
- Clubhead speed seems good but ball doesn't fly far
- Peers hit same club farther with less effort
- Launch monitor shows poor compression

**Root Causes:**
- **Flipping at impact** (adding loft)
- No forward shaft lean
- Ascending blow instead of descending
- Driver-like setup with irons
- Not using ground force properly

**Diagnosis:**
- Check impact position: Hands ahead or behind?
- Angle of attack: Negative or positive?
- Dynamic loft: Higher than static loft?
- Face-to-path relationship: Flipping?

**Fixes:**
- Proper iron setup (not driver setup)
- Forward weight shift emphasis
- Turn-shift-turn pattern
- Feel of "hands leading clubhead"
- Launch monitor feedback

**Launch Monitor Checkpoints:**
- Angle of attack: -3 to -5 degrees with mid-irons
- Dynamic loft: Close to static loft (not +5-10 degrees)
- Spin rate: Appropriate for club
- Ball speed: Optimized for your clubhead speed

- Becomes automatic checkpoint

**When to Use**: Pre-shot routine during practice; troubleshooting inconsistent contact

### Drill Category 3: Strike Quality Training

#### Set to Point Drill (Primary Strike Fix)

**Purpose**: Teach proper arm extension and eliminate chicken wing

**Equipment**: 7-iron, tee

**Setup:**
1. Use tee to remove strike anxiety
2. Think "low punch shot" or "under tree branches"
3. Proper address position

**Execution:**
1. SHORT backswing (waist height)
2. Intensely focus: SQUEEZE ELBOWS TOGETHER through swing
3. SHORT follow-through (waist height)
4. Feel arms extending DOWN target line
5. Keep body rotating (not arms-only)
6. Maintain normal swing speed (not slow motion)
7. Hit 10-15 shots focusing purely on movement quality

**Key Feels:**
- "Squeeze elbows" through hitting area
- Arms extending toward target
- Low, punchy finish
- Body rotating fully through
- Like hitting under branches

**Success Markers:**
- Tee remains in ground after shot
- Divot starts AFTER ball position (1 inch after)
- Crisp, compressed contact sound
- Ball flight lower than normal (this is correct for drill)
- Distance: ~120-130 yards with 7-iron in abbreviated swing

**Expected Results:**
- Initial swings may feel awkward
- Might hit a few fat shots initially (this is normal during pattern change)
- Don't judge after 3 shots - give it 10-15 to adapt
- Contact quality improves dramatically
- Real-world case: Dan went from fat/thin to pure in same session

**Progression:**
1. **Week 1**: Set to Point with tee only, abbreviated swing
2. **Week 2**: Set to Point off turf, same abbreviated swing
3. **Week 3**: Gradually lengthen backswing while maintaining "squeeze elbows" feel
4. **Week 4**: Progress to 3/4 swing maintaining pattern
5. **Week 5+**: Full swing integration

**When to Use**:
- Start of every practice session (10-15 reps)
- When chicken wing returns
- When contact deteriorates
- As warm-up before playing

#### Practice Swing Progression (No Ball)

**Purpose**: Groove arm extension feel without ball

**Equipment**: Any iron

**Step 1: No Ball, Hold Finish**
1. Mini backswing, stop
2. Swing through to mini follow-through
3. HOLD finish position
4. Visually check elbow gap - should be close together
5. Arms extending toward target
6. Repeat 5-10 times

**Step 2: With Tee**
1. Same motion with teed ball
2. Focus on MOVEMENT QUALITY over result
3. Lower ball flight is correct for drill
4. 10-15 repetitions

**Step 3: Progressive Distance**
1. Once consistent contact achieved, gradually lengthen swing
2. Always maintain "squeeze elbows" feel
3. Don't rush to full swing
4. Master at 75% before going to 100%

**Success Markers:**
- Can feel difference between extended and chicken wing
- Consistent contact with tee
- Pattern feels natural
- Can transfer to full swing

### Drill Category 4: Ground Contact Training

#### Ground Contact Awareness (No Ball)

**Purpose**: Learn to strike ground PAST ball position

**Equipment**: Club, mat or grass

**Setup:**
1. Normal iron stance
2. Imagine ball position
3. No ball present

**Execution:**
1. Make practice swings aiming to hit ground PAST imaginary ball
2. Use full turn-shift-turn body motion
3. Focus on low point being forward of ball position
4. On mat: Listen for and feel contact point
5. On grass: Watch divot location relative to ball position
6. Make 10-15 swings before each session

**Checkpoints:**
- Is divot starting PAST ball position?
- Consistent low point?
- Can you control where ground contact occurs?

**Success Markers:**
- Consistent contact past ball position
- Can see/feel the pattern clearly
- Divot starts after ball location
- Solid, crisp contact with ground

**When to Use**:
- Before every practice session
- When fat shots occur
- When thin shots occur (often same root cause)

**Progression:**
1. Without ball, focusing on ground contact past imaginary ball
2. With ball on tee, still focusing on ground contact
3. With ball on turf, implementing pattern
4. On course, trusting the pattern

#### Turn-Shift-Turn Body Motion (No Ball)

**Purpose**: Train proper body movement pattern for irons

**Equipment**: None (can practice at home)

**Setup:**
1. Golf stance with slight forward bend
2. Flexed knees
3. Cross arms across shoulders

**Execution:**
1. **Backswing - TURN**: Turn chest and hips, NO lateral movement
2. **Downswing - SHIFT**: Shift weight toward target
3. **Follow-through - TURN**: Rotate through to finish
4. Finish: Face target, weight on front leg, back toe released
5. Start slowly: "Turn... Shift... Turn..."
6. Gradually blend into fluid motion
7. Repeat 20-30 times
8. Can practice daily without club

**Success Markers:**
- Finish facing target every time
- All weight on front leg
- Back heel fully released
- No sway in backswing (pure rotation)
- Smooth, athletic motion

**When to Use**:
- Daily at home (no equipment needed)
- Warm-up before practice/play
- When feeling uncoordinated
- Building foundational movement pattern

### Drill Category 5: Integration and Feel Development

#### Feel vs Real - Iron Forward Shift

**Purpose**: Create proper forward weight shift and descending blow

**Equipment**: 7-iron, alignment stick

**Setup:**
1. Place alignment stick 6 inches in front of ball toward target
2. Iron setup (centered, neutral spine)
3. Weight 50-50 at address

**Execution:**
1. Make practice swings STEPPING toward stick through impact
2. Feel lead side post up and straighten
3. Weight should be 80-90% on lead foot at finish
4. Exaggerate feeling of "getting out front"
5. Hit shots with this exaggerated feel
6. Video to check actual position

**TPI Insight**:
- FEEL: "Way too far forward"
- REAL: Actually achieving proper impact position
- Tour players' feels are exaggerated but reality is more moderate

**Success Markers:**
- Divot starts at ball, extends toward target
- Ball-first contact every time
- Weight clearly favors lead side at finish
- You feel "too far forward" but video shows correct position

**When to Use**:
- When hanging back on trail side
- When flipping at ball
- Developing feel of proper impact
- Launch monitor work (checking angle of attack)

#### Video Analysis Self-Coaching

**Purpose**: Compare your patterns to identify specific issues

**Equipment**: Phone camera, tripod

**Angles to Capture:**

**Front-On View:**
1. Elbow gap: Address vs impact
   - FAULT: Gap widens significantly
   - CORRECT: Gap stays same or narrows
2. Head height: Track vertical movement
   - FAULT: Drops 3+ inches
   - IMPROVED: Stable or minimal drop
3. Weight distribution: Setup vs impact
   - CORRECT: Forward at impact

**Down-The-Line View:**
1. Takeaway: Arms connected or disconnecting?
   - FAULT: Push away from body
   - CORRECT: Stay connected
2. Parallel checkpoint: On plane?
   - FAULT: Shaft points left (over plane)
   - CORRECT: Parallel to target line
3. Impact: Hands ahead of ball?
   - FAULT: Hands even with or behind
   - CORRECT: Hands ahead, shaft leaning forward

**Execution:**
1. Record 5 swings each angle
2. Compare good shot vs bad shot
3. Identify specific differences
4. Apply appropriate drill for identified fault
5. Re-record after drill work to verify improvement

**When to Use**:
- Monthly check-ins
- When contact deteriorates
- After implementing fixes (verify improvement)
- Building self-diagnosis skills

## Self-Diagnosis System {#self-diagnosis}

### The Decision Tree for Iron Contact Issues

**Step 1: Identify the Symptom**

**Symptom A: Heel Strikes / Shanks**
→ Check: Disconnected takeaway?
→ Video front-on: Do arms push away early?
→ Check: On plane at parallel position?
→ Check: Weight on toes at address?
→ **Primary Fix**: Connected takeaway with proper setup

**Symptom B: Fat Shots**
→ Check: Chicken wing through impact?
→ Video front-on: Do elbows flare apart?
→ Check: Head dropping significantly?
→ Check: Low point behind ball?
→ **Primary Fix**: Set to Point drill (arm extension)

**Symptom C: Thin Shots**
→ Check: Same as fat shots (often same cause)
→ Check: Head rising through impact?
→ Check: Hanging back on trail side?
→ Check: Low point behind ball?
→ **Primary Fix**: Set to Point drill + forward shift

**Symptom D: Inconsistent Contact (Mixed)**
→ Check: Both takeaway AND arm extension issues?
→ Compare good vs bad shot videos
→ Look for variable head height
→ **Primary Fix**: Start with connected takeaway, then arm extension

**Symptom E: Loss of Distance**
→ Check: Hands behind ball at impact?
→ Check: Positive angle of attack?
→ Check: Setup too much like driver?
→ **Primary Fix**: Proper iron setup + forward shift emphasis

### Physical Screening Tests

**Before Assuming It's a Physical Limitation:**

**90/90 Test (Shoulder Mobility)**
1. Lie on back
2. Raise arm to 90 degrees from body
3. Bend elbow to 90 degrees
4. Can you lay arm flat without back arching?
5. PASS: Not a shoulder mobility issue
6. FAIL: May need mobility work before fixing swing

**Lat Length Test**
1. Lie on back
2. Arms overhead reaching
3. Can arms lay flat without back arching?
4. PASS: Not a lat tightness issue
5. FAIL: May need stretching routine

**If You Pass These Tests**: Issue is likely swing pattern, not physical limitation.

### Post-Shot Self-Assessment

**After Every Shot, Immediately Ask:**

1. **Setup**: Was weight balanced (not on toes)?
2. **Takeaway**: Did arms stay connected or push away?
3. **Impact Feel**: Did elbows stay together or flare?
4. **Weight Transfer**: Did I shift forward and post up?
5. **Contact**: Where did club contact ground relative to ball?

**If Fault Detected**:
- Acknowledge it immediately
- Make slow rehearsal swing correctly
- Feel the difference
- Next swing focuses on that specific fix

**Key Quote**: "You got to know the difference when you do these swings now, cuz then you can coach yourself."

### Pattern Recognition

**Learn Your Tendencies:**
- Do you default to disconnected takeaway under pressure?
- Does chicken wing return when tired?
- Do you hang back when trying to hit it hard?
- Does weight shift to toes as round progresses?

**Develop Your Feels:**
- What does "connected" feel like for YOU?
- What's your personal "squeeze elbows" feel?
- How much "forward" feels right?
- What's your "on plane" feel at parallel?

**Feel vs Real Understanding:**
- What you FEEL vs what you ACTUALLY do may be very different
- Elite players' feels are exaggerated
- Use video to calibrate your feels
- Your correct feels may feel extreme at first

## Conclusion: The Path to Pure Iron Striking

### The Core Principles Summarized

**1. Setup Matters More Than You Think**
- Proper stance width prevents faults
- Weight distribution is critical
- Iron setup must be different from driver setup
- Get this right and everything becomes easier

**2. Connection is King**
- Arms and body work together
- Disconnection requires compensation
- Connected feels "effortless"
- Fixes heel strikes and inconsistency

**3. Ball-First Contact is Non-Negotiable**
- Arm extension prevents chicken wing
- Head drop is usually a compensation
- Low point must be past the ball
- Set to Point drill creates immediate results

**4. Your Body Moves the Club**
- Turn-Shift-Turn pattern for irons
- Different from driver sequence
- Forward shift is essential
- Ground force patterns differ by club

**5. Diagnosis Before Drilling**
- Identify root cause, not just symptom
- Video reveals truth
- Physical limitations vs pattern issues
- Fix the cause, not the effect

### The Integration Mindset

**These Are Not Isolated Fixes**:
- Setup enables takeaway
- Takeaway influences strike quality
- Body motion affects ground contact
- Everything connects

**Master Sequentially**:
- Build foundation (setup)
- Add takeaway connection
- Develop strike quality (arm extension)
- Integrate full pattern
- Maintain and refine

**Feel vs Real Reality**:
- What you feel ≠ what you actually do
- Correct feels may feel extreme at first
- Use video to calibrate
- Develop YOUR personal feels

### From Inconsistency to Confidence

**The Transformation:**
- FROM: Mixed contact, heel strikes, fat/thin unpredictability
- TO: Consistent center contact, proper divots, effortless power

**Real Results from Real Students:**
- Victor: Zero heel strikes in 8 shots after connected takeaway
- Dan: Immediate pure contact after Set to Point drill
- Launch monitor improvements: Better path, distance, consistency

**Your Journey:**
- 8-week progression from fundamentals to integration
- Systematic, logical development
- Drills that produce immediate feedback
- Self-coaching capability for long-term success

### The Launch Monitor Validation

**What Good Iron Striking Looks Like:**
- **Angle of Attack**: -3 to -5 degrees (descending)
- **Dynamic Loft**: Close to static loft
- **Spin Rate**: Appropriate for club (6-iron ~6000 rpm)
- **Strike Location**: Center of face
- **Path**: Slight inside-out for natural draw
- **Face-to-Path**: Square to slight closed for control

**Use Technology When Available**:
- Validates your feels
- Provides objective feedback
- Tracks improvement over time
- Identifies specific areas to address

### Moving Forward

**This System Works Because:**
- Based on TPI's biomechanical research

- Progressive and systematic
- Develops self-coaching ability

**Your Next Steps:**
1. Start with Phase 1 (Setup foundations)
2. Follow the progression systematically
3. Don't skip phases or rush
4. Video yourself regularly
5. Develop your personal feels
6. Build self-coaching capability
7. Trust the process

**Remember**:
- Small changes create big results
- Just 2 inches of head drop is the difference between fat and pure
- Connected takeaway eliminates heel strikes immediately
- Proper setup enables everything else
- The goal is CONSISTENCY, not perfection

### Final Thoughts
