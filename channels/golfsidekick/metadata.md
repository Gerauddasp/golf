## Key Teaching Concepts

1. **Course Management > Swing Changes** - Think your way to lower scores
2. **Know Your REAL Distances** - Use averages, not best shots
3. **Eliminate Three-Putts** - Single biggest stroke saver at all levels
4. **Short Game Priority** - Differentiates every level transition
5. **666 Method** (Breaking 80) - 6 GIR + 6 up-and-downs + 6 birthday holes
6. **Think Box / Play Box** (Breaking 70) - Mental framework for elite play

## Philosophy

> "Breaking par imperfectly" - Eliminating big errors matters more than chasing perfection.
