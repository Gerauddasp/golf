# Breaking 90: From 90-99 to the 80s

**Core Philosophy:** "Master five essential shots" - Tactical course management beats swing changes

---

## 1. The 5 Essential Shots

### 1. Reliable Tee Shot
- **Club:** Your most consistent long club (driver, 3-wood, hybrid, or long iron)
- **Distance:** 145m+
- **Goal:** Hit fairway consistently - accuracy over power
- **Mindset:** This is your "go-to" for ALL par 4s and 5s

### 2. Pitch Shot (30-65m)
- **Club:** ONE wedge - pick your favorite (LW, GW, SW, or PW)
- **System:** Dave Pelz "Clock System" for distance control
  - 7:30 backswing = short
  - 9:00 backswing = medium
  - 10:30 backswing = full
- **Goal:** Get on green from scoring zone
- **Why Critical:** This shot saves 3+ strokes per round

### 3. Two Favorite Approach Clubs (inside 135m)
- **Choose exactly 2 clubs you TRUST**
- **Example:** Pitching wedge (110-120m) + Gap wedge (90-100m)
- **Strategy:** Break longer shots into TWO comfortable distances
  - 200m approach? Hit two 100m shots instead
- **Why:** Eliminates difficult rough shots, uses predictable distances

### 4. Chipping (One Club Only)
- **Club:** Pitching wedge (recommended) - NO lob wedge
- **Shot Type:** Bump-and-run only - no flop shots at this level
- **Technique:** Land ball on predetermined spot, let it roll like a putt
- **Goal:** Get ball on green FIRST, close to hole SECOND
- **Warning:** Never land at the hole - ball will roll past

### 5. Putting
- **Requirement:** Two-putt from everywhere is MANDATORY
- **Critical Distance:** Become lethal at 5 feet (make 90%+)
- **Three-putt limit:** Maximum 1-2 per round
- **Technique:** Keep head still until ball rattles in cup

## 2. Scoring Goals

| Hole Type | Target | How to Achieve |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Par 3 | Bogey acceptable, Par is bonus | Safe areas if green is tough |
| Short Par 4 (<320m) | Par | Hit green in 2, two-putt |
| Long Par 4 (365m+) | Bogey | 3 shots to green, two-putt |
| Par 5 | Par/Bogey | Treat as par 6, 4 shots OK |

**Target Scorecard:** 1 birdie + 11 pars + 6 bogeys = 89

**Stats Needed:**
- 8-10 greens in regulation
- Maximum 32 putts
- 1-2 three-putts max

---

## 3. Course Strategy

### Tee Selection Formula

> **Average drive distance x 28 = ideal course length**

- Example: 190m average drive x 28 = 5,320m course

**Adjust if:**
- More than 8 par 4s exceed 340m
- You can't reach par 3s comfortably

### One-Shot-Ahead Thinking
- **ALWAYS plan the next shot before hitting current shot**
- Position current shot for ideal next shot distance
- Ask: "Where do I want to be for my next shot?"
- Prevents getting "stuck" in bad positions

### Par-Specific Strategy

**Par 3s:**
- Aim for safe zones around green on long par 3s
- Accept bogey as good score
- Minimize greenside chips by strategic positioning

**Short Par 4s (275-320m):**
- Target: Green in two shots
- Use reliable tee club, not driver if risky

**Long Par 4s (365m+):**
- Target: Green in THREE shots
- Example (385m hole):
  1. Drive 145m = 240m remaining
  2. Hit 120m club = 120m remaining (favorite distance!)
  3. Hit favorite approach club to green
  4. Two putts = bogey or better

**Par 5s:**
- Treat as par 6
- Reachable par 5s (410m) in three = bonus
- No need for distance; steady progress wins
- 4 shots to green + 2 putts = bogey is success

---

## 4. Mental Game

### Pre-Round Preparation
- Develop relaxing pre-round habit (coffee, music, walking)
- Warm up properly (see practice section)
- Enter "zone" through process focus

### During Round
- **NEVER count cumulative score** - creates pressure
- Trust pre-round preparation
- Commit 100% to every shot - no tentative swings

### After Bad Shots
- Accept that bad shots happen
- "Take your medicine" - don't compound with risky recovery
- Move on mentally to next shot
- Bogey salvage prevents big numbers

### Visualization
- See the shot before you hit it
- Have clear mental picture of ball flight
- Pick specific target (not just "fairway")

## 5. What to Avoid

| Mistake | Why It Kills Your Score |
|---------|------------------------|
| Counting cumulative score | Creates mental pressure, causes tightness |
| Using "best shot" distances | You're short 70-80% of the time |
| Attempting risky recovery shots | One bad becomes two or three bad |
| Hitting flop chips | Too inconsistent, use bump-and-run |
| Skipping pre-round warm-up | Cold muscles = poor contact first 5 holes |
| Treating every shot like tournament | Creates tension, lose feel |
| Trying swing changes mid-round | Save for practice range |
| Forcing driver when uncomfortable | Fairway > 20 extra yards |
| Selecting tees too long | Sets up impossible approaches |

---

## 6. Practice Plan

### Range Practice - Course Simulation
- **Take ONLY your 5 selected clubs to range**
- **Simulate full 18-hole round on your home course**
- Use range flags/markers as fairway targets
- **Spend 2 minutes per shot** (don't rush)
- Include full pre-shot routine for each shot
- Mental trick: "Deposit" good shots in your bag like fairy dust for course use

### Pre-Round Warm-Up (20 minutes)

**Short Game (10 min):**
- Putt 10 balls from varying distances
- Hit 5 chip shots to different targets
- Practice one pitch shot distance

**Long Game (10 min):**
- Hit 10 balls with tee club
- Hit 5 balls with each approach club
- Focus on contact quality, not distance

### Chipping Drill
- **Place coin on practice green**
- Land chip shots ON the coin (not the hole)
- Practice from all greenside positions

### Putting Drills
- **Long putting:** 4-5 balls from 6m+ -> get within 1m
- **Short putting:** 5-6 balls around hole at 1.5m -> make consecutive putts before moving to new hole

---

## 7. Equipment Essentials

### Rangefinder/GPS (ESSENTIAL at this level)
- Measure distances to hazards and bunkers from tee
- Verify front-edge and carry distances
- Confirm distance traveled shot to shot
- Scorecard distances are often inaccurate

**Recommended:** Voice Caddie L5 or Garmin S40

### Club Selection
- Emphasize reliability over brand
- Know EXACT average distances for each club
- Use actual distances, not occasional long shots
- If PW averages 110m (not 125m), use 110m for planning

---

## 8. Key Statistics to Achieve

| Stat | Target |
|------|--------|
| Greens in Regulation | 8-10 per round |
| Fairways Hit | 7-10 per round |
| Three-Putts | Maximum 1-2 |
| Total Putts | Under 32 |
| Up-and-Downs | 4-5 per round |

- Easier courses remove one variable

### Playing Partners
- Play with slightly better golfers
