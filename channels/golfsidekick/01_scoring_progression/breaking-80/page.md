# Breaking 80: From 80-89 to the 70s

**Core Philosophy:** The "666 Method" - Built-in error tolerance that still produces 70s scores

---

## 1. The 666 Framework

This is the cornerstone strategy for breaking 80:

| Component | Target | What It Means |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| **6 Greens in Regulation** | Hit 6 GIR | Only need to hit 1/3 of greens! |
| **6 Up-and-Downs** | Save par 6 times | Scrambling from missed greens |
| **6 "Birthday" Holes** | Allow 6 mistakes | Double bogeys are acceptable |

**The Math:**
- 6 GIR with 2-putts = 6 pars
- 6 missed greens saved with up-and-down = 6 pars
- 6 remaining holes = bogeys or doubles
- Result: 78-79

**Why This Works:** Intentionally builds in error tolerance, preventing mental collapse from inevitable mishaps.

## 2. Shots You Need

### Tee Shot
- **Driver:** Use when confident, strategic
- **Alternative:** Short tee shots (6-iron, 4-wood) on tight holes
- **Goal:** Position for best approach, not maximum distance
- **Key:** Match club to YOUR strengths, not ego

### Approach Shots
- **Strategy:** Work backwards from green to determine ideal distance
- **Club:** Use enough club to CLEAR front hazards
- **Target:** Fat part of green, not the flag
- **Avoid:** "Sucker pins" tucked behind hazards

### Chipping
- **Club:** ONE primary club (PW recommended over lob wedge)
- **Target:** Land on coin-sized spot, let ball roll to hole
- **Trajectory options:** Learn to vary ball position for different trajectories
- **Goal:** Chips finish within 2 feet of hole (not just "on green")

### Pitching
- **Distance control:** Know your carry:roll ratios per club
- **Bounce selection:** Match wedge bounce to course conditions
  - Low bounce: hard ground
  - High bounce: soft ground
- **Commit:** No tentative pitches

### Putting
- **Inside 5 feet:** Make ALL of them (non-negotiable)
- **Three-putts:** ZERO tolerance - eliminate entirely
- **Lag putting:** Get long putts within 3 feet

## 3. Scoring Goals

| Stat | Target | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| Greens in Regulation | 6 minimum | Creates par opportunities |
| Scrambling (Up & Down) | 50%+ | Saves pars from missed greens |
| Three-Putts | 0 | Critical stroke saver |
| Putts Inside 5ft | 95%+ | Converts opportunities |
| Total Putts | Under 32 | Low putting = low scores |

**Realistic Scorecard:**
- 8 pars (6 from GIR + 2 from scrambling)
- 4 bogeys (decent misses)
- 6 "birthday" holes (mix of bogeys/doubles)
- Total: 78-79

---

## 4. Course Strategy

### Plan from Green Backwards
1. **Start at the flag:** What's my ideal approach distance?
2. **Work backwards:** Where should my tee shot land?
3. **Select tee club:** Based on positioning, not distance

### Green Targeting Philosophy
- **Target the "fat part" of green** - NOT the flag
- **Identify bail-out areas** - designed by course architects
- **Accept longer putts** from safe positions over risky short-sided chips
- **Avoid sucker pins:** Flags tucked behind hazards with minimal safe green

### Tee Shot Strategy
- On par 4s under 375m: Risk management > distance
- Consider: 6-iron off tee + easy wedge = safer par
- Driver only when landing zone is generous

### Miss Management
- Know your typical miss direction (fade or draw)
- Aim away from trouble, let your miss work
- Example: Slice tendency + water left = aim way left

---

## 5. Mental Game

### Commitment & Discipline
- **No distractions** during shot execution
- Resist ego-driven club selections
- Stick to gameplan despite peer pressure
- **"Never hit a throw-away shot"** after mistakes

### Language & Self-Talk
- **Eliminate "don't" and "can't"** from vocabulary
- Replace "don't go left" with "fade it right"
- Focus on positive action, not hazard avoidance
- Visualize flight path BEFORE addressing ball

### Emotional Management
- **Slow down after poor shots** - take extra time
- Assess what went wrong objectively
- Maintain composure to avoid cascading errors
- Treat each shot as most important, not hole result

---

## 6. What to Avoid

| Mistake | Why It Hurts |
|---------|--------------|
| Flag hunting | Brings hazards into play, short-sides you |
| Rushing after mistakes | Compounds one bad into two or three bad |
| Negative self-talk | "Don't hit water" = you hit water |
| Using insufficient club (ego) | Short-sided chips are hard to save |
| Chipping onto downslopes | Near-impossible to stop ball |
| Neglecting distance knowledge | Wrong club = wrong result |
| Skipping statistics tracking | Can't improve what you don't measure |

---

## 7. Practice Plan

### Short Game Priority (THE Differentiator)

> The difference between 80+ and sub-80 is getting up-and-down 50%+ vs rarely

**Weekly Short Game: 2+ hours**
- Chipping from various lies
- Pitch shots to coin-sized targets
- Sand save practice
- Putting drill: Make 10 consecutive 5-footers

### Chipping Excellence Drill
1. Place coin on green (target landing spot)
2. Chip 10 balls trying to land ON the coin
3. Not the hole - the LANDING SPOT
4. Track hit rate, aim for 70%+

### Putting Standards Drill
1. 5-6 balls around hole at 5 feet
2. Must make ALL consecutively
3. If miss one, start over
4. Move to new hole when successful

### Range Practice
- Full pre-shot routine every shot
- Practice approach shots from your favorite distances
- Work on go-to shots under pressure

## 8. Statistics to Track

Use apps like **GolfShot** or scorecard notes:

| Stat | What to Track |
|------|---------------|
| Fairways Hit | X/14 |
| Greens in Regulation | X/18 |
| Scrambling | Saved pars / Missed greens |
| Sand Saves | X/Y bunker attempts |
| Total Putts | Per round |
| 3-Putt Count | Should be 0 |

**Analyze weekly:**
- Which stat is costing you the most strokes?
- That's where practice time should go

---

## 9. Equipment

### Essential
- **Rangefinder** - exact yardages for precise club selection
- **GPS watch or launch monitor** (ShotScope H4 recommended)
- Detailed distance chart for each club

### Wedge Setup
- Match bounce to typical course conditions
- Know exact yardages for each wedge
- Consider having a "go-to" wedge for pressure situations

---

## 10. Personal Go-To Shots

Develop ONE reliable shot under pressure for:
- Tee shots (maybe a controlled fade with 3-wood)
- Approaches (maybe your 9-iron)
- Chips (bump-and-run with PW)
- Pressure putts (your routine + stroke)

**When in doubt, hit your go-to shot** - not the "right" shot.

---

## 11. Timeline & Expectations

- **Pre-requisite:** Breaking 90 consistently
- **Key focus:** Short game (up-and-down percentage)
- **Time investment:** 2+ hours short game weekly
- **Mindset shift:** Accept imperfection, build in error tolerance
