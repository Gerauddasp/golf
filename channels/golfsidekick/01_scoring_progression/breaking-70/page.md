# Breaking 70/Par: From 70-79 to Under Par

**Core Philosophy:** "Breaking par imperfectly" - Eliminate big errors, don't chase perfection

---

## 1. The Reality Check

> The author shot 71 despite hitting poor shots. Score management through eliminating big errors matters more than flawless execution.

**Key Insight:** Only 6 shots separate a 75 from a 69 on the same course.

---

## 2. Shots You Need

### Tee Shots
- **Club Selection:** Choose based on CONFIDENCE, not convention
- **Goal:** Set up easier approach shots from YOUR best distance
- **Key:** Know what distance you want to be at for your approach
- **Avoid:** Forcing driver when you're not feeling it

### Approach Shots
- **Map your repertoire:** Know your draw/fade capabilities and distances
- **Identify problem distances:** (Author struggles at 90-95m specifically)
- **Position over distance:** Get to YOUR favorite yardage
- **Standard:** Pitch shots from inside 55m should finish within 2m "very often"

### Short Game
- **Scrambling:** Elite level - save par from everywhere
- **Chip position:** NEVER short-sided (non-negotiable)
- **Putting:** Zero three-putts, make everything inside 1.5m

### The Go-To Shot
- Develop ONE shot you can hit under maximum pressure
- This is your "bail-out" when doubt creeps in
- Example: Controlled fade, bump-and-run, etc.

## 3. The Think Box / Play Box System

**This is the MOST IMPORTANT mental framework for breaking par:**

```
+-------------------------------------------+
|           THINK BOX                       |
|         (Behind the ball)                 |
|                                           |
|  - Assess wind direction                  |
|  - Identify hazards                       |
|  - Check pin location                     |
|  - Calculate distance                     |
|  - Feel the stance                        |
|  - Choose club                            |
|  - Pick exact target                      |
|  - Visualize shot shape                   |
|                                           |
+-------------------+-----------------------+
                    |
          ===================
          DECISION LINE
          (Commitment boundary)
          ===================
                    |
                    v
+-------------------------------------------+
|           PLAY BOX                        |
|         (At the ball)                     |
|                                           |
|  - ZERO doubt                             |
|  - Blank mind                             |
|  - Execute the plan                       |
|  - Complete commitment                    |
|                                           |
|  WARNING: If doubt appears:               |
|     BACK AWAY and restart!               |
|                                           |
+-------------------------------------------+
```

**The Rule:** Once you cross the decision line, there is NO second-guessing. If fear or doubt emerges while in the Play Box, you MUST back away and restart the entire process.

## 4. Scoring Goals

| Requirement | Target |
|-------------|--------|
| Greens in Regulation | 12+ |
| Scrambling | 65%+ |
| Three-Putts | 0 |
| Birdie Opportunities | 4-6 per round |
| Converted Birdies | 2-3 per round |
| Big Numbers (Double+) | Maximum 1 |

**The Math:**
- 2-3 birdies
- 12-14 pars
- 2-3 bogeys
- 0-1 double
- = 69 or better

---

## 5. Course Strategy

### Position Optimization
- **Map your personal shot repertoire**
  - What's your comfortable draw distance?
  - What's your comfortable fade distance?
  - Where do you struggle? (identify specific yardages)
- **Set up approach shots from YOUR confident distances**
- **NEVER get short-sided** - this is where big numbers happen

### Hole Strategy
1. Identify your best-miss directions for each shot
2. Locate safest parts of greens to putt from
3. Plan around YOUR actual capabilities, not aspirations
4. Use lay-ups strategically when approach options are limited

### Recovery Play
- When in trouble, get OUT of trouble
- Don't compound errors by going for hero shots
- Bogey is acceptable; double is not

## 6. The 8 Key Mental Strategies

### 1. Strategic Tee Shots
- Select clubs that provide confidence, not maximum distance
- Avoid uncomfortable tee positions that lead to trees/hazards
- Ask: "What shot am I 100% confident I can execute?"

### 2. Managing Disappointment
- Separate golf performance from self-worth
- Accept that perfection isn't achievable without PGA Tour practice
- Focus ONLY on the next shot, not previous results
- Understand the SPECIFIC cause of bad shots

### 3. Present-Moment Focus
- Treat each hole individually within a round
- Plan the next shot immediately after completing current one
- Pick shots you GENUINELY know how to execute
- Avoid "chasing losses" with emotional, risky decisions

### 4. Complete Commitment
- **100% commitment or don't hit** (99% is NOT enough)
- Never play shots you're uncertain about
- If doubt appears during execution, back away and reset
- Replace questionable shots with reliable alternatives

### 5. Position Optimization
- Know your problematic distances and avoid them
- Set up approaches from distances where you have maximum confidence
- Plan hole strategy around your strengths, not weaknesses

### 6. Think Box / Play Box
(See Section 3 above)

### 7. Post-Shot Routine
- React neutrally or positively to ALL shots
- Identify SPECIFIC cause of poor shots:
  - Commitment issue?
  - Club selection error?
  - Distance miscalculation?
  - Green reading mistake?
- Use errors as learning opportunities, not character judgments
- Avoid "you suck" self-talk - focus on specific skill deficits

### 8. Control What's Controllable

**You CAN Control:**
- Physical fitness and sleep
- Club and shot selection
- Shot planning and focus
- Clothing and equipment
- Attitude and emotional reactions
- Commitment level
- Nutrition

**You CANNOT Control:**
- Weather conditions
- Course layout and characteristics
- Previous shot results or ball bounces
- Playing partners' behavior or skill
- Pace of play
- Course conditions (green speed, grass type)
- Other players' distances or abilities

> Obsessing over uncontrollable factors GUARANTEES poor performance.

## 7. What to Avoid

| Fatal Mistake | Why It Destroys Your Round |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| Playing without 100% commitment | Tentative swings produce bad results |
| Attempting unpracticed shots | You'll fail under pressure |
| Emotional decisions after bad shots | Compounds one mistake into three |
| Comparing to playing partners | Their game is irrelevant to yours |
| Forcing driver when uncomfortable | Fairway beats distance every time |
| Getting short-sided | Impossible up-and-downs create doubles |
| Ignoring problem distances | Keep ending up in your weak zones |
| Blaming external factors | Wastes mental energy on uncontrollables |

---

## 8. Practice Priorities

### Course Management Mastery
- Play practice rounds focused on positioning, not scoring
- Track where you miss greens and why
- Identify and eliminate problem distances

### Mental Practice
- Practice the Think Box / Play Box routine on range
- Build commitment muscle by backing away when uncertain
- Develop post-shot routine (neutral reaction, specific analysis)

### Technical Practice
- Work on shots you NEED, not shots that are fun
- Practice from your problem distances until they're strengths
- Pressure putting practice (must-make scenarios)

### Recommended Reading

> **"Every Shot Must Have a Purpose"** - credited as transformational for mental game

---

## 9. Equipment & Distances

### Know Your Real Distances
- Use 80% distances (what you hit most often), not best-case
- Track with launch monitor or GPS watch
- Update distances seasonally (summer vs winter)

### Rangefinder (Non-negotiable)
- Exact yardages for every shot
- Front/middle/back of green
- Hazard clearance distances
- Eliminate guessing entirely

### Club Selection
- Drop ego shots from your bag
- If you can't hit it consistently, don't use it
- Older clubs may have different lofts - know YOUR distances

---

## 10. Timeline & Expectations

- **Pre-requisite:** Breaking 80 consistently
- **Key shift:** From technique focus to mental/strategic mastery
- **Critical skill:** Think Box / Play Box system
- **Differentiator:** Eliminating big numbers, not making more birdies
- **Reality:** Amateur golfers at this level practice like mini-tour players
