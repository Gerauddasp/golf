# Breaking 100: From 100-120+ to the 90s

**Core Philosophy:** "Play smarter, not harder" - Eliminate penalties through conservative play

---

## 1. Shots You Need

### Tee Shot
- **Club:** ONE reliable club that goes 135m+ straight (hybrid, 6-iron, or 7-iron)
- **Requirement:** Leave driver at home entirely
- **Goal:** Hit fairway or rough - just avoid hazards and OB

### Approach Shots
- **Clubs:** Mid-irons (6, 7, 8, 9, PW, SW)
- **Requirement:** Know your ACTUAL average distance (not your best shot)
- **Goal:** Get ball somewhere on or near the green

### Chipping
- **Club:** ONE club only - pitching wedge OR 7-iron
- **Shot Type:** Bump-and-run only (no flop shots)
- **Technique:** Low shot that lands on green quickly and rolls to hole
- **Goal:** Get ball on the green, not necessarily close to hole

### Pitching (under 45m)
- **Club:** Sand wedge or pitching wedge
- **Goal:** Land ball on green - proximity to hole is secondary
- **Technique:** Easy swing, smooth tempo

### Putting
- **Requirement:** Two-putt from anywhere on green
- **Goal:** Eliminate three-putts completely
- **Focus:** Speed control over line accuracy

## 2. Scoring Goals

| Hole Type | Target Score | How to Achieve |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| Par 3 | Bogey (4) | One shot on/near green + 2 putts + buffer |
| Short Par 4 (<320m) | Bogey (5) | 2 shots to green + 2 putts + buffer |
| Long Par 4 (365m+) | Double bogey (6) | 3 shots x 130m + 2 putts |
| Par 5 | Double bogey (7) | 4 shots to green + 2 putts |

**Score Math:** 9 bogeys + 9 double bogeys = 99

---

## 3. Course Strategy

### Hole Segmentation
- **Divide every hole into 130m segments**
- Long par 4 (385m) = three 130m shots
- Par 5 (455m) = four shots (3x130m + 75m pitch)

### Par-Specific Strategy

**Par 3s:**
- Play from forward tees where you can reach green

**Short Par 4s:**
- Two wedge shots beats one risky fairway wood

**Long Par 4s:**
- Accept double bogey as success
- Three easy shots

**Par 5s:**
- Treat as par 6
- Four shots to green is fine

### Tee Selection Formula

Play from tees where:
- You can reach par 3 greens easily
- Most par 4s are under 345m
- Fairways are reachable on almost every hole

### Hazard Avoidance
- **Priority #1:** Avoid water hazards and OB at all costs
- Use shorter, straighter clubs
- Aim for the widest part of fairway
- If trouble exists, lay up before it

---

## 4. Mental Game

### Pre-Round
- Choose correct tees (ego killer but score saver)
- Accept that bogeys and doubles are GOOD scores
- Remind yourself: "No one cares if I'm bad"

### During Round
- **DO NOT count your score** - only count at the end
- Leave ego at the clubhouse
- No theatrical reactions to bad shots
- Keep pace, keep moving

### Shot Selection Mindset
- Ask: "What's the shot I can make 8 out of 10 times?"
- Never attempt low-percentage hero shots
- Your favorite shot > the "right" shot

---

## 5. What to Avoid

| Mistake | Why It Kills Your Score |
|---------|------------------------|
| Using driver | Primary cause of OB and water penalties |
| Playing wrong tees | Sets up impossible approach shots |
| Counting score mid-round | Creates pressure and tension |
| Using "best shot" distances | You'll be short 80% of the time |
| Three-putting | Adds 5-10 strokes per round |
| Hero recovery shots | One bad shot becomes three |
| Long approach clubs | Two short shots > one risky long shot |
| Scooping chips | Causes chunks and blades |

## 6. Practice Plan

**Total: 4 hours/week**

### Range Practice (2 hours)
1. **20 pitching wedges** - Easy swing, focus on solid contact
2. **20 six-irons** - Easy swing, focus on solid contact
3. **20 hybrid/tee club shots** - Easy swing, straight ball
4. **9 imaginary holes** - Pick targets, use pre-shot routine, simulate course

### Short Game Practice (2 hours)
1. **Bump-and-run chips** - Various distances, one club
2. **Pitch shots 30-45m** - Land on green, any proximity
3. **Two-putt drills** - Lag putting from 6m+, eliminate 3-putts

### Key Practice Principles
- Swing at 80% effort maximum
- Focus on FEELING solid contact
- Every shot gets full pre-shot routine
- Quality over quantity

## 7. Setup Fundamentals

### Distance from Ball

> "Place the top of the grip on your front leg about an inch or two above the kneecap - where the club head rests is where the ball goes"

This applies to ALL clubs from driver to wedge.

### Must-Know Basics
1. Ball position for each club
2. Proper posture and stance width
3. Grip fundamentals
4. Impact position (hands ahead)

---

## 8. Equipment Needs

- **Leave at home:** Driver
- **Tee club:** Hybrid OR 6-iron (whichever you hit straightest)
- **Irons:** 6, 7, 8, 9, PW, SW
- **Chipping:** Use PW or 7-iron
- **Putter:** Whatever you have
- **Optional:** Rangefinder (helps know real distances)

---

## 9. Timeline & Expectations

- **With consistent practice:** 2 weeks to break 100
- **Weekly commitment:** 4 hours (2 range + 2 short game)
- **Realistic first attempt:** 16+ shot improvement possible
