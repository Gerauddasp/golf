## What to Avoid (By Level)

### Breaking 100
- Using driver (primary cause of penalties)
- Playing wrong tees
- Counting score mid-round
- Using "best shot" distances

### Breaking 90
- Counting cumulative score
- Attempting risky recovery shots
- Flop shots
- Skipping pre-round warm-up

### Breaking 80
- Flag hunting (brings hazards in play)
- Rushing after mistakes
- Negative self-talk ("don't hit water")
- Neglecting statistics tracking

### Breaking 70
- Playing without 100% commitment
- Attempting unpracticed shots
- Emotional decisions after bad shots
- Comparing to playing partners

---

## Practice Priorities

### Breaking 100 (4 hrs/week)
- **Range (2 hrs):** 20 PW + 20 6-irons + 20 hybrids + 9 imaginary holes
- **Short Game (2 hrs):** Bump-and-run chips, 30-45m pitches, 2-putt drills

### Breaking 90
- Course simulation on range (5 clubs only)
- Coin landing drill for chips
- Putts: 6m+ lag to 1m, consecutive 1.5m makes

### Breaking 80 (2+ hrs short game weekly)
- Up-and-down practice (50%+ target)
- 10 consecutive 5-foot putts
- Chipping to coin-sized landing spots

### Breaking 70
- Think Box/Play Box routine on range
- Practice from problem distances
- Pressure putting (must-make scenarios)

4. **Pre-Shot Routine** - Consistency breeds confidence
5. **Rangefinder/GPS** - Essential equipment
6. **Avoid Ego Shots** - Play YOUR game
7. **Accept Mistakes** - Don't compound with risky recovery

## Key Frameworks

### The 666 Method (Breaking 80)
- 6 Greens in Regulation
- 6 Up-and-Downs to save par
- 6 "Birthday" holes allowed (doubles OK)

### Think Box / Play Box (Breaking 70)
1. **Think Box** (behind ball): Assess everything, make decisions
2. **Decision Line**: Cross = commit fully
3. **Play Box** (at ball): Zero doubt, blank mind, execute
4. If doubt appears -> BACK AWAY and restart
