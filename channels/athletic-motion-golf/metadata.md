# Athletic Motion Golf - Channel Metadata

## Overview
Athletic Motion Golf (AMG) is a data-driven golf instruction channel utilizing advanced biomechanics research and 3D motion capture technology. The channel features PGA professionals and biomechanics experts who break down the golf swing using scientific principles and measurable data.

## Teaching Philosophy
- **Evidence-Based:** All instruction backed by 3D motion capture data and tour player analysis
- **Biomechanics-Focused:** Understanding WHY movements work, not just WHAT to do
- **Fault Pattern Recognition:** Identifying root causes through data analysis
- **Measurable Improvement:** Focus on quantifiable metrics and benchmarks

## Content Summary
- **Total Videos (Last 2 Years):** 100
- **Quality Instructional Videos:** 92 processed successfully
- **Videos Without Transcripts:** 2 (ultra-short Shorts with transcripts disabled)
- **Videos Excluded:** 3 (app promotional content without instruction)
- **Video Types:** Full swing mechanics, fault diagnosis, speed training, club-specific instruction
- **Content Length:** Primarily 5-15 minutes (detailed breakdowns), many quality 30s-1min shorts
- **Processing Success Rate:** 95%

## Key Instructors

### Mike Granato
- PGA Professional
- 3D motion capture specialist
- Focus: Full swing mechanics, fault diagnosis

### Shaun Webb
- Biomechanics expert
- Swing analysis specialist
- Focus: Technical breakdowns, sequencing, rotation

### Kevin Sprecher
- PGA Professional
- Tour player coach
- Focus: Practical application, on-course performance

## Processing Notes
- **Channel fetched:** 2025-10-28
- **Filtering criteria:** Quality instructional content, excluded pure app promos and celebrity shorts
- **Last 2 years:** Videos from October 2023 onwards
- **Transcripts fetched:** 2025-10-28
- **Summaries generated:** 2025-10-28

## Key Teaching Concepts

### Biomechanics Fundamentals
- **Virtual Spine Angle:** 90° neutral spine for optimal rotation and back health
- **Pelvic Re-centering:** Proper weight shift and lateral movement
- **Shoulder Retraction:** Maintaining width through proper shoulder blade movement
- **Kinematic Sequence:** Ground-up power generation and timing
- **Trail Arm Depth vs Width:** Proper arm structure in backswing

### Common Faults Addressed
- **Casting:** Early release, loss of lag
- **Steep Downswing:** Over-the-top move, outside-in path
- **Early Extension:** Standing up through impact, loss of posture
- **Loss of Width:** Collapsing trail arm, "lawnmower" move
- **Spine Angle Issues:** Reverse spine, excessive tilt

### Speed & Power Training
- **Timing-Based Speed:** Loading early in swing for better sequencing
- **Takeaway Tempo:** Faster backswing for increased clubhead speed
- **Ground Forces:** Proper use of lower body for power
- **Effortless Power:** Sequencing over muscular force

## Technology & Equipment

### 3D Motion Capture (Gears)
- Tracks 1000+ data points per swing
- Measures spine angle, pelvic motion, shoulder plane, arm positions
- Compares amateur swings to tour averages
- Identifies specific fault patterns

### Trackman Launch Monitor
- Ball flight data (speed, spin, launch angle, carry distance)
- Club data (clubhead speed, attack angle, path, face angle)
- Used for before/after comparisons

### Force Plates
- Measures ground reaction forces
- Tracks weight shift and pressure distribution
- Analyzes lower body sequencing

### High-Speed Video
- 1000+ FPS for detailed motion analysis
- Multiple camera angles
- Synced with 3D data for complete picture

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Topic-based video index (all "spine angle" videos together)
- [ ] Fault diagnosis flowchart (symptom → videos)
- [ ] Drill library organized by fault pattern
- [ ] Progress tracking with measurable benchmarks
- [ ] Integration with swing analysis apps
