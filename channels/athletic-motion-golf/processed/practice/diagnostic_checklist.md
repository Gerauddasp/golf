## How to Use This Checklist

1. **Film Your Swing:** Multiple angles (down-the-line, face-on, overhead if possible)
2. **Work Through Checklist:** Systematically check each position
3. **Identify Deviations:** From biomechanical principles
4. **Prioritize:** Start with root causes (usually backswing/setup)
5. **Refer to Solutions:** Use video numbers to find specific drills

**Remember:** Most faults originate in backswing or setup, not where you think they do.

## Setup Diagnostics

### Address Position

**Stance Width:**
- [ ] Outside hip width minimum for full swings
- [ ] Narrow for chips (one club width)
- [ ] Appropriate for club type

**Ball Position:**
- [ ] Driver: Inside lead heel or forward
- [ ] Irons: Progressively back by club
- [ ] Wedges: Center to slightly back
- [ ] Chips: Back of center

**Weight Distribution:**
- [ ] Neutral or slight lead bias at setup
- [ ] NOT hanging back on trail side
- [ ] Balanced and athletic

**Spine Angle:**
- [ ] Forward tilt from hips (not rounding)
- [ ] Side tilt appropriate for club (more with driver)
- [ ] Sustainable throughout swing

**Distance from Ball:**
- [ ] Arms hang naturally
- [ ] No reaching or crowding
- [ ] Optimal for club length

**Alignment:**
- [ ] Hips square (not open)
- [ ] Shoulders square (not open)
- [ ] Forearms level (trail not elevated)
- ⚠️ **Video 59:** Open setup = outside takeaway → laid-off → steep

### Grip Diagnostics

**Lead Hand:**
- [ ] Heel pad on top of grip (not side)
- [ ] Finger-base grip (not palm)
- [ ] Can see 2-2.5 knuckles down-the-line

**Trail Hand:**
- [ ] Thumb NOT on top of grip
- [ ] No "glide-off" sensation (air in grip)
- [ ] Firm pressure but mobile wrists

**Overall Grip:**
- [ ] Firm enough: Partner can't pull club away
- [ ] Mobile enough: Can circle club with wrist
- [ ] This paradox is TRAINABLE skill
- 📹 **Videos 53, 57, 90**

## Backswing Diagnostics

### Takeaway (First Move)

**Path:**
- [ ] Club, hands, arms, shoulders move together
- [ ] NOT just arms lifting
- [ ] Lead shoulder rotation drives movement

**Plane:**
- [ ] Two-Dial balance: Turn + Lift at equal rates
- [ ] 45-degree plane target
- [ ] NOT excessively inside (too much turn)
- [ ] NOT excessively outside (too much lift)
- 📹 **Video 9:** Turn dial + Lift dial balance

**First 12 Inches:**
- [ ] Continuous motion (no pause)
- [ ] Body rotation begins immediately
- [ ] Unified movement pattern
- ⚠️ **Video 45:** Pause at takeaway creates laid-off compensation

### Lead Arm Parallel Checkpoint

**Critical Checkpoint Position:**

**Hand Depth (Video 51):**
- [ ] Hands should NOT be deep yet
- [ ] "Up early, in late" timing
- [ ] Too deep here = steep downswing inevitable

**Wrist Angles:**
- [ ] Natural hinge developing
- [ ] NOT forced manipulation
- [ ] Lead wrist flat to slightly bowed

**Body Turn:**
- [ ] Shoulders ~45° rotated
- [ ] Hips ~22-25° rotated
- [ ] X-factor developing

### Top of Backswing

**Spine Angle (Video 13):**
- [ ] 90° virtual spine angle (optimal)
- [ ] NOT excessively tilted (steep spine)
- [ ] NOT reverse spine (tilt toward target)
- [ ] Tennis ball pivot feel

**Trail Arm Structure (Videos 11, 43, 80):**
- [ ] Upper arm approximately horizontal (tricep parallel to ground)
- [ ] Arm has ELEVATED relative to torso (40-45° increase from address)
- [ ] NOT lowered relative to torso
- [ ] Space visible between arm and ribs
- ⚠️ **Arms lowered = casting inevitable**

**Width Maintenance (Video 6):**
- [ ] "Rectangle" shape preserved
- [ ] Hands NOT collapsed close to body
- [ ] Shoulder retraction visible (30-35°)
- [ ] "Most important real estate" maintained

**Wrist Positions:**
- [ ] Natural ~90° hinge
- [ ] Lead wrist: Flat to slightly bowed (NOT cupped)
- [ ] Trail wrist: Extended (cupped)
- ⚠️ **Video 37:** Excessive bow creates laid-off position

**Hand Position:**
- [ ] Outside "head circle" (Butch Harmon checkpoint)
- [ ] Visible space between head and hands
- [ ] NOT behind head
- [ ] Appropriate depth for YOUR mobility

**Shoulder Turn:**
- [ ] ~90° rotation
- [ ] Trail shoulder up and back significantly
- [ ] Lead shoulder down and forward moderately
- [ ] NOT 1:1 ratio—asymmetrical movement
- 📹 **Video 20**

**Hip Turn:**
- [ ] ~45° rotation
- [ ] Around pelvis CENTER (not trail hip)
- [ ] ~1 inch lateral shift maximum
- [ ] NOT excessive slide
- 📹 **Videos 27, 31**

**Trail Knee (Video 34):**
- [ ] Has FLEXED during backswing (+6° average)
- [ ] NOT straightened
- [ ] Follows "wave pattern"
- ⚠️ **Straightening knee = locking position = overturning**

**Lead Knee:**
- [ ] Slight inward movement acceptable
- [ ] NOT excessive "kick in"
- [ ] Maintains three-dot alignment (hip-knee-ankle)
- 📹 **Video 85**

**Lead Femur Position (Video 73):**
- [ ] Can move forward up to 3 inches
- [ ] BUT trail hip must counterbalance back 3 inches
- [ ] "3 forward, 3 back" balanced
- ⚠️ **Forward without counterbalance = early extension inevitable**

**Weight Distribution:**
- [ ] 60-70% on trail side
- [ ] NOT 100% (maintain connection both sides)
- [ ] NOT reverse (weight on lead side)

---

## Transition Diagnostics

### Early Downswing

**"The Float" (Video 56):**
- [ ] Club finishing backswing while body starts downswing
- [ ] NOT stopping everything at top
- [ ] Overlap in movements
- [ ] Kinematic sequence requires this

**Trail Arm Reconnection (Video 61):**
- [ ] Trail elbow NEAR rib cage at transition
- [ ] NO large gap between elbow and torso
- [ ] Arm has reconnected before extending
- ⚠️ **Gap = casting = jack-knife down**

**Sequencing:**
- [ ] Pelvis starts rotating toward target
- [ ] Shoulders still loading (turning back)
- [ ] Maximum X-factor stretch occurs
- [ ] Arms beginning to lower

**Trail Knee (Video 34):**
- [ ] GAINING flex through transition
- [ ] NOT straightening yet
- [ ] Preparing for powerful extension
- [ ] "Knee switch" pattern

---

## Halfway Down Checkpoint

**Critical Position for Diagnosis (Video 100)**

**Body Positions:**
- [ ] Knees SQUARED (not over-rotated)
- [ ] Hand line still BACK behind body
- [ ] Visible "stretch" between lower/upper body
- [ ] Upper arm aligned with torso midline

**Club Position:**
- [ ] On plane (not dropped excessively)
- [ ] Hands above waist level
- [ ] Maintaining lag angle
- [ ] Face orientation correct (vertical)

**Lead Knee Position Test (Video 73):**
- [ ] Has returned to (or behind) starting position
- [ ] If FORWARD = early extension coming (too late to fix)
- ⚠️ **This checkpoint predicts early extension**

**Separation Checkpoint (Video 68):**
- [ ] Thighs square
- [ ] Pelvis square to slightly open
- [ ] Shoulders closed (shirt buttons pointing away)
- [ ] Proper X-factor maintained

---

## Pre-Impact Diagnostics

### Delivery Phase (35ms window)

**Too fast to consciously control—must be set up correctly earlier**

**Hand Path:**
- [ ] Staying on TRAIL side of body
- [ ] NOT crossing midline
- [ ] Moving out and around toward ball
- 📹 **Video 96:** 8 inches out and around

**Trail Elbow:**
- [ ] DEEPER and farther BEHIND pelvis than at top
- [ ] Moving OUTSIDE (toward ball)
- [ ] NOT in front of pelvis/hip
- ⚠️ **Videos 81, 84, 86:** "Lead with elbow" = myth

**Lead Shoulder (Club-Specific):**
- **Driver:** [ ] At or behind setup position
- **Irons:** [ ] 2-2.5 inches FORWARD of setup
- 📹 **Video 41**

**Pelvis Rotation:**
- [ ] 40-45° open
- [ ] Still rotating (not stalled)
- [ ] Trail leg straightening to enable rotation

**Trail Knee (Video 49):**
- [ ] Moving FORWARD ("space invader")
- [ ] Not just rotating back
- [ ] Heel released from ground
- [ ] Enables 45° pelvis rotation

---

## Impact Diagnostics

### Body Positions

**Weight Distribution:**
- [ ] 80-90% on lead side
- [ ] Lead leg braced (not locked)
- [ ] Trail toe contact only

**Spine Angle:**
- [ ] Has extended from address (21° average)
- [ ] Maintains side bend toward trail side
- [ ] "Flat back" from 45° view
- ⚠️ **Video 44:** Extension is NORMAL, not fault

**Hip Rotation:**
- [ ] 40-45° open
- [ ] Trail hip toward ball (center-axis rotation)
- [ ] Lead hip back and around

**Trail Knee:**
- [ ] LOWER than lead knee
- [ ] Forward of starting position
- [ ] Enables proper hip tilt
- 📹 **Video 17**

**Handle Position (Video 88):**
- [ ] 2-3 inches HIGHER than address
- [ ] 4-5 inches FORWARD
- ⚠️ **"Create space" = myth; handles stay trail side but rise and move forward**

### Club Delivery

**Shaft Lean (Club-Specific):**
- **Driver:** [ ] 0-2° forward lean (essentially vertical)
- **Irons:** [ ] ~8° forward lean
- **Critical:** Different requirements for different clubs
- 📹 **Video 75**

**Attack Angle:**
- **Driver:** [ ] +3 to +5° (ascending)
- **Fairway Woods:** [ ] 0° (neutral)
- **Irons:** [ ] -3 to -6° (descending, steeper with shorter irons)

**Face Angle:**
- [ ] Square to target (or desired start line)
- [ ] Achieved through wrist rotation (45-65°)
- [ ] NOT through body rotation alone
- 📹 **Video 58**

### Release Diagnostics

**Lag Release (Video 32):**
- [ ] Wrist angle HAS released (must happen)
- [ ] NOT holding angle through impact (impossible)
- [ ] Timing: Late but present
- [ ] Location: Low point area

**Divot Pattern (Irons):**
- [ ] FORWARD of ball (not behind)
- [ ] Consistent depth
- [ ] Direction toward target
- [ ] Evidence of proper release
- 📹 **Video 28**

## Common Diagnostic Errors

### Looking in Wrong Place

**If You See Casting:**
- ❌ Don't look at downswing
- ✅ Check backswing trail arm lift (Video 80)
- ✅ Check grip (Video 53)
- ✅ Check trail arm reconnection (Video 61)

**If You See Steep Downswing:**
- ❌ Don't try to shallow in downswing
- ✅ Check backswing timing "up early, in late" (Video 51)
- ✅ Check for bow wrist manipulation (Video 37)
- ✅ Check setup alignment (Video 59)

**If You See Early Extension:**
- ❌ Don't try to stay down in downswing
- ✅ Check lead femur management in backswing (Video 73)
- ✅ Check lead knee position at top (Video 85)
- ✅ Use halfway down checkpoint

**If You See Loss of Posture:**
- ❌ Don't try to maintain rigid spine angle
- ✅ Understand extension is normal (21°) - Video 44
- ✅ Differentiate proper extension from early extension
- ✅ Check if it's actually early extension (thrust)

### Misinterpreting Video

**2D vs 3D Reality:**
- [ ] Understand camera angles create illusions
- [ ] "Looks like" ≠ "is actually"
- [ ] Use multiple angles
- [ ] Apply 3D concepts to 2D video

**What "Appears" vs What "Measures":**
- Lead with elbow: Appears true on 2D, measures false in 3D (Videos 81, 84, 86)
- Vertical spine: Appears on video, measures 74-80° (Video 13)
- Create space: Appears to wipe across, actually stays trail side (Video 96)
- Maintain posture: Appears static, actually extends 21° (Video 44)

## Prioritization Guide

### Start Here (Highest Priority)

**1. Setup & Fundamentals**
- Grip (Videos 53, 57, 90)
- Alignment (Video 59)
- Ball position
- Distance from ball
- ⚠️ **Setup drift sabotages everything** (Video 99)

**2. Backswing Pattern**
- Trail arm lift vs lower (Video 80) - **CRITICAL FOR CASTING**
- Width maintenance (Video 6) - **"Most important real estate"**
- Proper timing: "up early, in late" (Video 51)
- Lead femur management (Video 73) - **CRITICAL FOR EARLY EXTENSION**

**3. Transition/Sequencing**
- Kinematic sequence order
- Trail arm reconnection (Video 61)
- The float (Video 56)
- Halfway down checkpoint (Video 100)

### Then Address (Medium Priority)

**4. Lower Body Action**
- Trail knee flex pattern (Video 34)

- Don't manufacture

**7. Follow-Through**
- Usually reflects earlier movements
- Fix earlier positions first
- Follow-through improves automatically

## Diagnostic Questions by Symptom

### "I'm Casting the Club"

**Check:**
1. [ ] Are my trail arms LIFTING in backswing? (Video 80)
   - Film down-the-line
   - Check arm-torso angle increases (should go from ~45° to ~85-90°)
   - If lowering = casting source found

2. [ ] Head circle checkpoint: Hands outside circle at top? (Video 80)
   - Visible space = good
   - Behind/inside circle = arms lowered

3. [ ] Grip issues? (Video 53)
   - Heel pad placement
   - Trail thumb security
   - Thumb on top error

4. [ ] Trail arm reconnection? (Video 61)
   - Gap between elbow and ribs at transition?
   - Large gap = casting coming

### "My Downswing is Steep"

**Check:**
1. [ ] Am I bowing lead wrist at top? (Video 37)
   - This CAUSES steepness, doesn't fix it
   - Creates laid-off position
   - Forces pull compensation

2. [ ] Depth timing: "Up early, in late"? (Video 51)
   - Film at lead arm parallel
   - Hands should NOT be deep yet
   - Adding depth too early = steep later

3. [ ] Setup alignment? (Video 59)
   - Body open at address?
   - Trail forearm elevated?
   - Creates outside takeaway → laid-off → steep

4. [ ] Rotation prerequisites met? (Video 16)
   - Slack in transition?
   - Proper clubface position?
   - Arms working down while rotating?

### "I Have Early Extension"

**Check:**
1. [ ] Lead femur position in backswing? (Video 73) **START HERE**
   - Does knee move forward without trail hip counterbalance?
   - "3 forward, 3 back" balanced?
   - This is 99.99% the cause

2. [ ] Lead knee position at top? (Video 85)
   - Excessive "kick in"?
   - Breaks three-dot alignment?
   - 20 yards lost from this alone

3. [ ] Halfway down checkpoint? (Video 73)
   - Lead knee returned to start position?
   - If forward = early extension already coming
   - Too late to fix at this point

4. [ ] Compensating for steep path?
   - Body lifts to prevent crash
   - Fix steep path (see above)
   - Early extension may resolve automatically

### "I'm Losing Distance"

**Check:**
1. [ ] Backswing speed/loading? (Video 2)
   - "Bunny slope" vs "steep hill" speed graph
   - Adding speed early?
   - Timing-based speed present?

2. [ ] Trail leg pattern? (Videos 34, 48, 85)
   - Knee flexing in backswing (+6° average)?
   - Straightening properly in downswing?
   - Space invader knee forward movement?
   - Pelvis rotation achieving 40-45°?

3. [ ] Width maintenance? (Video 6)
   - Lawnmower collapse?
   - Rectangle preserved?
   - Shoulder retraction?

4. [ ] Hip rotation quality? (Video 65)
   - Internal/external hip rotation pattern?
   - Elastic stretch created?
   - Halfpipe vs spinning top? (Video 62)

### "My Tempo is Inconsistent"

**Check:**
1. [ ] Setup drift? (Video 99) **CHECK FIRST**
   - Film setup regularly
   - Compare to baseline
   - Imperceptible changes sabotage everything

2. [ ] Backswing speed? (Videos 3, 4, 10)
   - Too deliberate/slow?
   - Creates rushed transition
   - More motion needed early

3. [ ] Pattern consistency?
   - Quick-slow-quick pattern (Video 83)
   - Same tempo each swing
   - Not reacting to last ball

## Video Analysis Protocol

### Required Camera Angles

**Down-the-Line (DTL):**
- **Setup:** Camera directly behind hands, aligned with target
- **Distance:** 8-10 feet back, waist height
- **Shows:** Plane, positions, width, depth, shoulder movement

**Face-On:**
- **Setup:** Camera facing golfer, perpendicular to target line
- **Distance:** 8-10 feet away, waist height
- **Shows:** Weight shift, spine angle, rotation, lateral movement

**Overhead (If Possible):**
- **Setup:** Camera directly above, looking down
- **Shows:** Pelvis-arm relationships, true elbow position, rotation around center
- **Critical For:** Debunking visual illusions from standard angles

**45-Degree:**
- **Setup:** Camera at 45° between DTL and face-on
- **Shows:** True spine angle appearance, "flat back" checkpoint

### Checkpoint System

**Use Slow-Motion:**
- Film at highest frame rate available
- Pause at key positions
- Compare to tour player examples
- Measure when possible

**Key Pause Points:**
1. Setup
2. Takeaway (club shaft parallel to ground)
3. Lead arm parallel (backswing)
4. Top of backswing
5. Lead arm parallel (downswing) - **CRITICAL CHECKPOINT**
6. Shaft parallel (pre-impact) - **35ms to impact, too late for adjustments**
7. Impact
8. Lead arm parallel (follow-through)
9. Finish

### Measurement Tools

**On-Screen Drawing:**
- Vertical lines for shoulder position
- Horizontal lines for height changes
- Circles for head/hand relationship
- Angles for spine tilt, knee flex

**Reference Overlays:**
- Tour player comparison
- Own baseline swing
- Previous practice session
- Track progress over time

**AMG Swing Coach App:**
- Real-time feedback during practice
- Parameter monitoring
- Instant coaching
- Progress tracking

1. **Setup Issues** - Foundation for everything
2. **Trail Arm Lowering in Backswing** - Causes casting
3. **Lead Femur Management** - Causes early extension
4. **Width Loss** - "Most important real estate"

### Tier 2: Address Next

5. **Takeaway Path/Plane** - Sets up entire swing
6. **Depth Timing** - "Up early, in late"
7. **Trail Knee Flex Pattern** - Power generation
8. **Hip Rotation Quality** - Internal/external pattern

### Tier 3: Often Byproducts (May Resolve Automatically)

9. **Shaft Lean** - Results from proper mechanics
10. **Lag Angle** - Results from backswing pattern
11. **Follow-Through** - Results from earlier positions
