## Overview

This practice system synthesizes Athletic Motion Golf's evidence-based instruction into a structured training methodology. Unlike feel-based approaches, AMG emphasizes:

✅ **Objective measurement** over subjective feels
✅ **Root cause fixes** over symptom treatment
✅ **Progressive speed integration** over immediate full-speed practice
✅ **Video verification** over "it feels right"
✅ **Parameter focus** over ball flight reaction

## The AMG Practice Philosophy

### Core Principles

**1. "React to the Last Ball" is the #1 Reason Range Sessions Fail** (Video 99)

Amateurs waste 90+ minutes adjusting to ball flight outcomes instead of systematically working on biomechanical movement patterns.

**AMG Solution:**
- Work on 1-2 specific movements
- Use objective feedback (video, technology)
- Ignore ball flight initially
- Progressive speed integration

**2. Feel ≠ Real**

What you feel is NOT what you do.

**AMG Solution:**
- Film relentlessly
- Use technology for objective truth
- Exaggerated feels often necessary
- Video verification essential

**3. Setup Drift Sabotages Everything** (Video 99)

Imperceptible setup changes accumulate and destroy swing changes.

**AMG Solution:**
- Constant setup monitoring
- Return to baseline regularly
- Video documentation
- "Body's TrackMan" calibration

**4. Most Faults Originate in Backswing or Setup**

Not where you're looking or trying to fix.

**AMG Solution:**
- Start diagnostic with setup and backswing
- Fix root cause, not symptom
- Downstream issues often resolve automatically
- Systematic progression

## Progressive Speed Integration Protocol

**The AMG Method** (Video 99)

### Why Progressive Speed Matters

**The Problem:**
Practicing at game speed while learning new pattern:
- Brain can't process feedback fast enough
- Pattern doesn't encode properly
- Leads to "grooving" incorrect movement
- Results in frustration

**The Solution:**
Build pattern at slow speeds, progressively increase as pattern stabilizes.

### The Protocol

**Phase 1: 25% Speed**
- **Purpose:** Pattern encoding
- **Duration:** Until movement feels natural (days to weeks)
- **Focus:** Perfect execution, no ball
- **Feedback:** Video, mirror, kinesthetic awareness
- **Success:** Can perform consistently without thought

**Phase 2: 50% Speed**
- **Purpose:** Pattern reinforcement under light load
- **Duration:** Until pattern remains stable
- **Add Ball:** Yes, but ignore results completely
- **Focus:** Maintaining pattern from Phase 1
- **Success:** Pattern survives speed increase

**Phase 3: 75% Speed**
- **Purpose:** Pattern acceleration
- **Duration:** Until pattern automatic at this speed
- **Focus:** Feel recalibration (will feel different)
- **Feedback:** Video verification essential
- **Success:** Pattern holds under moderate speed

**Phase 4: Game Speed**
- **Purpose:** Performance application
- **Duration:** Ongoing
- **Focus:** Trust pattern, minimal conscious thought
- **Integration:** On-course use
- **Success:** Pattern automatic under pressure

### Critical at Each Phase

**Feel Recalibration:**
- Pattern will feel DIFFERENT at each speed
- What worked at 50% feels wrong at 75%
- Must re-calibrate kinesthetic awareness
- Normal part of learning process

**Video Verification:**
- What you feel ≠ what you do
- Especially true during speed increases
- Essential to verify pattern holding
- Prevents drift to old patterns

## Parameter-Focused Practice

### What is Parameter Training?

**Definition:**
Working on specific biomechanical movements (parameters) rather than reacting to ball flight outcomes.

**Examples of Parameters:**
- Trail arm lift in backswing
- Shoulder retraction amount
- Lead knee position at top
- Hip rotation depth
- Weight distribution percentages

### How to Practice Parameters

**Session Design:**

**Choose 1-2 Parameters Maximum:**
- Example combo: Trail arm lift + width maintenance
- NOT: Trail arm + width + tempo + rotation + release (too many)

**Ignore Ball Flight:**
- Don't adjust based on where ball goes
- Work on parameter execution
- Trust process over results
- Ball flight improves as byproduct

**Use Objective Feedback:**
- Video shows parameter
- App provides measurement
- Not feel-based assessment
- Quantifiable verification

**Example Session: Fix Casting**

**Parameter:** Trail arm lift in backswing

**Practice:**
1. **25% Speed (5 min):** Split-hands drill, no ball, focus on arm lift feeling
2. **50% Speed (10 min):** With ball, maintain arm lift, ignore where ball goes
3. **Video Check (2 min):** Verify arm-torso angle increasing
4. **75% Speed (10 min):** Continue if pattern holding, drop back if breaking
5. **Integration (8 min):** Few swings at game speed maintaining parameter

**Do NOT:**
- Adjust based on ball flight
- Change parameter mid-session
- React to mishits
- Judge success by results

**DO:**
- Stay focused on single parameter
- Use video to verify
- Trust biomechanics
- Celebrate parameter execution (not good shot)

## Common Practice Mistakes (Video 99)

### Mistake #1: React to Last Ball

**What It Looks Like:**
- Hit ball right → adjust to hit left
- Hit ball fat → adjust to hit thin
- Never working on root cause
- Chasing ball flight

**Why It Fails:**
- Never addresses biomechanical fault
- Random adjustments without pattern
- No motor learning occurs
- Frustration and inconsistency

**AMG Solution:**
- Identify root cause first (diagnostic)
- Work on specific parameter
- Ignore ball flight during training
- Measure biomechanical improvement

### Mistake #2: All Practice at Game Speed

**What It Looks Like:**
- Every swing is full speed
- Try to ingrain changes under pressure
- Expect immediate results
- Get frustrated when pattern breaks

**Why It Fails:**
- Brain can't process at 200ms downswing speed
- Pattern doesn't encode
- Old habits reassert under speed
- No actual learning occurs

**AMG Solution:**
- Progressive speed protocol (25% → 50% → 75% → game)
- Build pattern at speed where brain can process
- Speed up only when pattern stable
- Recalibrate feel at each level

### Mistake #3: No Setup Monitoring

**What It Looks Like:**
- Assume setup is fine
- Focus only on swing
- Don't film setup positions
- Wonder why nothing improves

**Why It Fails:**
- Imperceptible drifts accumulate
- Setup changes affect entire swing
- Work on swing built on bad foundation
- Sabotages all improvement efforts

**AMG Solution:**
- Constant setup verification
- Film and compare to baseline
- Return to standards regularly
- Prevent drift before it starts

### Mistake #4: Too Many Focus Areas

**What It Looks Like:**
- Work on grip, takeaway, top position, transition, impact in one session
- Try to fix everything simultaneously
- Mental overload
- Paralysis by analysis

**Why It Fails:**
- Motor learning requires focused attention
- Can't encode multiple patterns simultaneously
- Cognitive overload prevents any learning
- Everything gets worse, nothing better

**AMG Solution:**
- 1-2 parameters maximum per session
- Master one before adding next
- Progressive building
- Systematic approach

## Integration with On-Course Play

### Practice → Performance Bridge

**Challenge:**
Range patterns not transferring to course.

**AMG Approach:**

**1. Simulation Practice:**
- Random clubs (like course demands)
- Pre-shot routine inclusion
- Varied targets
- Course-like pressure

**2. Checkpoint Simplification:**
- Complex drill → simple feel/thought
- "Split-hands backswing" → "arms lift"
- "Shoulder retraction 30°" → "wide arms"
- One simple cue from complex training

**3. Trust Training:**
- You've done the work
- Pattern is encoded
- Don't over-think on course
- Simple trigger thought only

### Pre-Round Preparation

**30 Minutes Before:**

**10 Min: Setup Verification**
- Grip, alignment, posture
- Return to baseline
- Simple, fundamental

**15 Min: Pattern Reminder**
- Light drill work at 50-75%
- Remind body of current focus
- NOT trying to fix things
- Just activation

**5 Min: Tempo & Integration**
- Full swings at game speed
- Pre-shot routine practice
- Trust training
- Positive focus

### On-Course Focus

**Maximum 1-2 Simple Thoughts:**

If working on casting fix:
- Simple cue: "Arms lift"
- NOT: "Increase arm-torso angle from 45° to 90° while retracting scapula 35°"

If working on width:
- Simple cue: "Wide"
- NOT: "Maintain rectangle, shoulder retraction, chest-high checkpoint"

**Trust Your Training:**
- Complex work done in practice
- Course is for playing
- Simple triggers only
- Let automatic pattern execute

## Frequently Asked Questions

### "How long until I see results?"

**AMG Answer:**
Depends on complexity and depth of change:

- **Simple fixes** (grip, setup): Days to 1-2 weeks
- **Pattern changes** (casting, width): 3-6 weeks
- **Deep changes** (early extension, sequencing): 6-12 weeks
- **Complete rebuild:** 6-12 months

**Critical:** Results appear at GAME SPEED last
- May see improvement at 50% speed in week 1
- May take 4-6 weeks for improvement at game speed
- On-course performance: Additional 2-4 weeks
- Trust process, don't rush

### "Can I work on multiple things?"

**AMG Answer:**
1-2 parameters maximum per session.

**Why:**
- Motor learning requires focused attention
- Brain can't encode multiple complex patterns simultaneously
- Better to master one thing than partially improve five things

**Exception:**
If issues are related (casting + grip), can work together since fixing one helps the other.

### "Should I practice with all clubs?"

**AMG Answer:**
Depends on stage:

**Learning New Pattern:**
- Stick with ONE club (usually 7-iron)
- Builds consistency
- Reduces variables
- Faster encoding

**Integration Phase:**
- Work across bag
- Club-specific adjustments
- Random selection
- Transfer training

**Maintenance:**
- Vary clubs freely
- Spot-check with video
- Maintain distinctions (driver vs iron mechanics)

### "What if it feels wrong but looks right on video?"

**AMG Answer:**
This is NORMAL and EXPECTED.

**Why:**
- Years of incorrect pattern feels "normal"
- Correct pattern feels "wrong" initially
- Proprioception is miscalibrated
- Brain needs time to adjust

**Solution:**
- Trust video over feel
- "Earn your feels" through repetition
- Exaggerated initially, normalizes over time
- 100-500 reps typically needed for feel to match reality

### "Ball flight got worse - should I stop?"

**AMG Answer:**
Maybe, maybe not.

**Analysis Required:**

**If biomechanics improved but ball flight worse:**
- CONTINUE - this is normal transition period
- Old swing produced "good" shots through compensations
- New pattern not yet trained to full speed
- Trust process, continue progressive integration

**If biomechanics unchanged or regressed:**
- PAUSE - reassess understanding
- Review diagnostic
- Ensure working on root cause
- May need different drill or better understanding

**Key Question:**
Is video showing improvement in target parameter? If yes, continue. If no, reassess.
