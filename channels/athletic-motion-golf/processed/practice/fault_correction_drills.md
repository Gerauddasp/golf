## Backswing Fault Drills

### Casting (Trail Arm Lowering) {#casting-drills}

#### **Drill 1: Split-Hands Backswing** (Video 80)
**Primary Fix for Casting**

**Purpose:** Force proper trail arm lift in backswing

**Setup:**
1. Grip club with hands shoulder-width apart
2. Trail hand near club head, lead hand normal position
3. Address ball normally

**Execution:**
1. Make backswing with split grip
2. Arms MUST lift (lowering is impossible with this grip)
3. At top, slide hands together quickly
4. Complete downswing normally
5. Creates automatic later release

**Success Markers:**
- Trail arm clearly elevated at top
- Visible space between arms and body
- Later release automatically appears
- Better compression

**Progression:**
1. Start with slow-motion swings (no ball)
2. Add ball at 50% speed
3. Progress to 75% speed
4. Occasional check at game speed
5. Eventually remove drill (pattern learned)

---

#### **Drill 2: Head Circle Checkpoint** (Video 80)
**Butch Harmon Diagnostic**

**Purpose:** Verify trail arm hasn't lowered

**Setup:**
1. Film down-the-line view
2. Pause at top of backswing
3. Draw imaginary circle around head

**Checkpoints:**
- [ ] **CORRECT:** Hands outside circle, visible space between head and hands
- [ ] **ERROR:** Hands behind or inside circle = arms lowered

**Application:**
- Use as diagnostic before split-hands drill
- Re-check after practicing
- Ongoing verification tool
- Simple visual reference

---

#### **Drill 3: Grip Correction** (Videos 53, 90)

**Purpose:** Fix grip issues promoting casting

**Three Specific Fixes:**

**Fix 1: Heel Pad Placement**
- Heel pad on TOP of grip (not side)
- Prevents club wobble
- Secure foundation

**Fix 2: Trail Thumb Security**
- Prevent "glide-off" sensation
- Eliminate "air in grip"
- Firm but not tight
- Most common casting cause

**Fix 3: Thumb Position**
- NOT on top of grip (creates leverage)
- Slightly to side
- Reduces early release tendency

**Placement Method (Video 90):**
- **Behind-the-Back:** Grip with hand behind body (exploits arm rotation)
- **In-Front:** Grip with hand forward of body
- Either method = automatic finger-base placement

---

#### **Drill 4: Trail Arm Reconnection** (Video 61)

**Purpose:** Fix jack-knife casting from gap between elbow and torso

**Setup:**
1. Make backswing to top
2. Pause
3. Check trail elbow position

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] Elbow NEAR rib cage (not large gap)
- [ ] If gap exists = casting inevitable

**Correction Drill:**
1. **Static Position Practice:**
   - Set up at top position
   - Bring trail elbow to rib cage
   - Feel reconnection
   - Hold position 5 seconds

2. **Slow Motion Integration:**
   - Backswing to top
   - Pause briefly
   - Consciously reconnect elbow
   - Continue to impact
   - Speed up gradually

**Two-Part Movement Understanding:**
1. Reconnect elbow to torso (transition)
2. Then extend through impact (don't stay connected all the way)

---

### Loss of Width {#width-drills}

3. Check position at top of backswing
4. **CRITICAL CHECK:** Position at halfway down

**Checkpoints:**
- [ ] **At Top:** Can be slightly forward (up to 3" if trail hip goes back 3")
- [ ] **Halfway Down:** MUST be back at or behind starting position
- [ ] If forward at halfway down = early extension inevitable (too late to fix)

**"3 Forward, 3 Back" Principle:**
- Lead femur can move forward 3 inches
- Trail hip MUST counterbalance back 3 inches
- Turn around pelvis center
- No net forward thrust

---

#### **Drill 2: Depth Gauge Training** (Video 73)
