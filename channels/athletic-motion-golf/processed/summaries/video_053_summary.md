## Overview

This short instructional video identifies three primary grip-related causes of casting that Athletic Motion Golf instructors observe with equal frequency during lessons. The focus is on hand positioning—specifically the placement of the lead hand's heel pad and the trail hand's thumb—and how improper grip fundamentals create instability that leads to early release patterns. The instructors emphasize that grip issues manifest in two main ways: creating a loose, unstable connection where the club "wobbles" during the swing, or creating excessive leverage that encourages early wrist release.

## Key Concepts

### Lead Hand Positioning - Heel Pad Placement
- **Critical Setup**: The heel pad (fatty part of the palm) must sit on top of the grip
- **Common Error**: Golfers often position the lead hand too far under the club, similar to a "hammer grip"
- **Result of Poor Positioning**: The club lacks a stable "place" to rest in the hand, causing it to wobble and creating control issues
- **Biomechanical Effect**: Without proper pad-on-top positioning, the club becomes disconnected from the body's rotational forces

### Trail Hand Thumb Position - The "Glide Off" Problem
- **Proper Position**: Trail thumb should NOT sit directly on top of the grip
- **Visual Check**: Film your backswing and watch for the thumb "gliding off" at some point during the motion
- **Description of Issue**: Creates a "baggy hole" or "narrow grip" with "too much air in the grip"
- **Metaphor**: "Leaking air in your grip" - the instability causes the club to bounce around
- **Frequency**: This is the most common grip-related casting issue AMG sees in lessons

### Trail Thumb On Top - The Leverage Problem
- **Positioning Error**: Trail thumb positioned too far on top of the grip
- **Mechanical Issue**: Creates excessive leverage potential, encouraging the golfer to "lever the club"
- **Casting Mechanism**: The leverage position makes it biomechanically easier to release the club angle early in the downswing
- **Frequency**: Less common than the "glide off" problem, but when present, creates obvious casting patterns

## Actionable Drills

### Lead Hand Heel Pad Check
**Purpose**: Establish proper lead hand foundation to prevent club wobble
**Setup**:
- Hold club in trail hand only
- Identify the heel pad (fatty part) of your lead palm
**Execution**:
1. Place the heel pad directly on top of the grip (not underneath)
2. Close the fingers around the grip with the pad maintaining top position
3. Shake the club gently—it should feel stable, not loose
4. Add trail hand only after lead hand is secure
**Success Markers**:
- No wobble when waggling the club
- Club feels "locked" into the lead hand
- Heel pad pressure is clearly felt on top of the grip

### Trail Hand Thumb Self-Assessment
**Purpose**: Identify if you have the "glide off" casting problem
**Setup**:
- Use your phone to record your swing from down-the-line view
- Focus camera on your hands at address and during backswing
**Execution**:
1. Set up with your normal grip
2. Take several practice swings while being filmed
3. Review footage in slow motion
4. Specifically watch the trail thumb position during the backswing
5. Note if the thumb "glides" or separates from its original position
**Success Markers**:
- Trail thumb maintains consistent contact throughout backswing
- No visible gap or "air" appears between thumb and grip
- Grip looks equally firm at top of backswing as it did at address
**Correction**: If you see glide-off, focus on maintaining light but constant thumb pressure throughout the swing

### Trail Thumb Position Reset
**Purpose**: Eliminate excessive leverage that promotes casting
**Setup**:
- Grip the club with lead hand in proper position (heel pad on top)
- Examine where your trail thumb naturally wants to sit
**Execution**:
1. If your thumb sits directly on top of the grip, reset the position
2. Rotate the trail hand slightly so the thumb sits more on the side/lifeline of the grip
3. The thumb should point more down the shaft, not across it
4. Make practice swings focusing on NOT levering the club with the thumb
5. Feel like you're "holding" the club rather than "leveraging" it
**Success Markers**:
- Reduced sensation of being able to push/lever the club with the thumb
- Less early wrist unhinging sensation in the downswing
- Smoother transition from backswing to downswing without the hands leading

## Key Takeaways

1. **Three Equal Causes**: AMG sees three grip-related casting causes with equal frequency—lead hand heel pad position, trail thumb glide-off, and trail thumb leverage position

2. **Lead Hand Foundation First**: Always establish the lead hand grip with heel pad on top before adding the trail hand—this prevents the "hammer grip" wobble problem

3. **Film to Diagnose**: Use video analysis specifically to watch for the trail thumb "gliding off" during the backswing—this creates "air in the grip" and loss of control

4. **Leverage Awareness**: If your trail thumb sits on top of the grip, you're biomechanically set up to lever the club and cast early in the downswing

5. **Stability Over Pressure**: The goal is grip stability, not grip pressure—proper hand positioning creates stability even with relatively light grip force

## Related Concepts

- **Casting**: The early release of wrist angles during the downswing, losing lag and power
- **Grip Pressure vs. Grip Position**: This video emphasizes that WHERE you hold the club matters more than HOW TIGHT you hold it
- **Visual Feedback**: The emphasis on filming yourself highlights AMG's data-driven approach to identifying swing issues
- **Sequential Setup**: The specific instruction to set the lead hand FIRST, then add the trail hand, prevents compensatory grip issues
