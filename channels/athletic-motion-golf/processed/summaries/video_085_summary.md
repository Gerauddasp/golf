## Overview

Athletic Motion Golf demonstrates how a 57-year-old golfer gained 20 yards of carry distance by fixing a critical lead leg position fault during the backswing and transition. The video uses force plate analysis to explain the biomechanics of proper lower body sequencing for maximum ground force generation. The primary issue addressed is the "knee kick in" - where the lead knee moves excessively toward the target at the top of the backswing, eliminating the ability to create a proper brace and generate speed through ground reaction forces.

This case study illustrates how modern swing instruction (lifting the lead heel to maximize turn) can actually sabotage speed production when executed incorrectly. The solution involves maintaining proper alignment of the hip-knee-ankle on the lead leg while still achieving a full turn, then creating optimal bracing mechanics through transition and downswing.

## Key Concepts

### The "Knee Kick In" Fault (Death Move for Speed)

**Problem Mechanics:**
- Lead knee kicks inward at the top of backswing (trail femur becomes vertical or past vertical)
- Hip joint moves outside the knee joint alignment
- Creates a narrow, unstable base with feet too close together
- Often taught as a method to lift the lead heel and increase shoulder turn

**Biomechanical Consequences:**
- Eliminates ability to create a brace on lead side during transition
- Lead hip "runs down the fairway" - slides past lead foot with nothing to stop it
- Results in "soft knees" at impact with hips too far forward
- Turns off lower body power generation - forces reliance on upper body only
- "A lot of effort and not much payoff"
- Creates inconsistent contact (timing issues with irons - fat/thin)

**Why It's Widespread:**
- Commonly taught in older instruction methods (1960s-70s generation)
- Misconception that lifting lead heel automatically creates more clubhead speed
- Appears to allow greater shoulder rotation (which it does, but at a cost)

### Proper Lead Leg Alignment at Top of Backswing

**The Three-Dot System:**
- Think of three alignment points: middle of ankle, middle of knee, middle of hip joint
- "Not the outside of your pants, but right in that hip joint"
- These three points should remain in relative alignment at the top (at an angle, but in line)

**Correct Top Position:**
- Lead knee DOES still bend - approximately twice as much as address position
- Hip-knee-ankle maintain alignment (not out of alignment)
- Hips remain inside the trail foot at the top
- Trail hip turns AWAY from lead leg (internal rotation into trail hip)
- Creates stretch in hip flexor area on lead side

**Feel Descriptions:**
- "Letting my pelvis turn away from this leg" (not pull on it)
- "Like winding up from my lead toe all the way to my hands like a big rubber band"
- "Internal rotation into the trail hip"
- Should feel challenging to hold the top position (indicates proper stretch/load)

**Note:** If you can comfortably hold the top position for a long time, you haven't created adequate stretch in the system.

### Stance Width for Power Generation

**The Student's Original Setup:**
- Feet almost inside hip width
- Thought narrow stance allowed more turn
- Created instability that prevented ground force generation

**Optimal Setup:**
- Stance width "definitely outside the width of the hips"
- Significantly wider than most golfers think
- Provides stable base for creating rotational forces
- Allows proper lead leg alignment without restricting turn

**Principle:** You CAN turn more with narrow stance, but it doesn't help power generation due to instability.

### Transition and Downswing Bracing Mechanics

**Key Checkpoint - Lead Leg Position:**
- Knee moves over ankle (shin becomes vertical)
- Hip joint stays INSIDE/BEHIND the knee joint
- Creates "something to push against" - a brace
- Allows generation of vertical ground forces

**Position Hierarchy:**
- IDEAL: Hip behind knee, knee over ankle
- DEATH: Knee out past ankle (sliding through impact)
- POOR: Hip twisted way behind lead ankle

**Force Plate Principle:**
- Proper alignment allows maximum ground force utilization
- Vertical force application "kicks up clubhead speed"
- Creates "breaks to hit from"

**Feel Description:**
- "Punching into that position" (not drifting into it)
- Hips "get up under me" instead of running forward
- Similar to good drivers of the ball in tour data

### Trail Leg Action and Ankle Awareness

**Common Compensating Error:**
- Rolling trail ankle in too much from the top
- Causes excessive forward slide
- Straightens trail leg too soon
- Blocks the swing

**Correct Trail Leg Feel:**
- Twist the trail foot in a way that knees move rotationally (not laterally)
- Avoid straightening trail leg prematurely
- Trail leg action should support rotational movement, not linear slide

### The "Uppercut" Release Pattern

**Final Speed Component:**
- Once proper bracing is established, final speed boost comes from release
- "If I'm going to uppercut somebody, I need to go from here to there"
- Club points back at golfer through impact zone
- Represents the last acceleration phase after ground forces are optimized

**Sequence:**
1. Create proper brace (lead leg mechanics)
2. Apply vertical force through brace
3. Execute uppercut release pattern

## Actionable Drills

### Drill 1: Top Position Alignment Check

**Purpose**: Establish proper hip-knee-ankle alignment at top of backswing
**Equipment**: Golf club or alignment stick

**Setup:**
- Take normal driver stance with wider base (outside hips)
- Have partner or coach observe from down-the-line view

**Execution:**
1. Take slow motion swing to top of backswing
2. Stop and hold position
3. Check alignment: ankle-knee-hip should form relatively straight line (at an angle)
4. Lead knee should be bent (flexed) but not kicked inward
5. Pelvis should be inside trail foot, not pulled forward by lead knee
6. Repeat 5-10 times, gradually increasing speed while maintaining positions

**Success Markers:**
- Difficult to hold top position comfortably (indicates proper stretch/load)
- Feel stretch in lead hip flexor area
- Sense of internal rotation into trail hip
- "Rubber band" wound from lead toe to hands

**Common Errors:**
- Holding position comfortably with no tension = insufficient load
- Lead knee pulling pelvis forward
- Trail knee past vertical

### Drill 2: Shaft Barrier Drill for Knee Control

**Purpose**: Prevent excessive lead knee kick-in during backswing
**Equipment**: Golf shaft or alignment stick

**Setup:**
- Take address position
- Have partner place shaft 3-4 inches in front of lead knee
- Shaft should be just above toes, creating barrier

**Execution:**
1. Make backswing to top position
2. Goal: Complete full turn WITHOUT hitting shaft with knee
3. Forces trail hip to rotate around (not pelvis pulling forward)
4. Prevents "early thrust" where lead knee pulls pelvis out
5. Start with slow motion reps, progress to normal speed
6. Do 10-15 reps focusing on hip rotation away from leg

**Success Markers:**
- Never contact the shaft barrier
- Maintain stretch sensation in lead hip area
- Trail hip rotates behind, not pelvis sliding forward
- Full shoulder turn achieved without knee kick

**Key Feel:**
- "Making sure trail hip goes around rather than letting lead knee pull pelvis out"

### Drill 3: Top-to-Impact Bracing Sequence

**Purpose**: Train proper lead leg bracing through transition and downswing
**Equipment**: Driver or training club

**Setup:**
- Establish proper top position (from Drill 1)
- No ball initially

**Execution - Phase 1 (Without Ball):**
1. Move slowly from top position to just before impact
2. Stop at transition checkpoint: knee moving over ankle, hip staying behind
3. Hold position and verify: shin vertical, hip inside knee
4. Feel the brace - "something to push against"
5. Complete swing with speed from this position
6. Repeat 10 times

**Execution - Phase 2 (With Ball):**
1. Apply same sequence with ball
2. Focus: establish brace position, then release through
3. "Punch into that position" rather than drift
4. Goal: knee over ankle, hip behind, then apply vertical force

**Success Markers:**
- Snapshot at transition shows: knee over ankle (shin vertical), hip behind knee
- NEVER: knee out past ankle (sliding)
- Feel of "brakes" or firm brace on lead side
- Hips "getting up under you" rather than running forward
- Solid contact with noticeable speed increase

**Progression:**
- Master slow motion with holds
- Progress to continuous motion without ball
- Add ball with focus on position, not outcome
- Finally, blend into full speed swings with positions ingrained

### Drill 4: Dynamic Bracing with Speed

**Purpose**: Apply proper bracing mechanics at full speed
**Equipment**: Driver

**Setup:**
- Use proper stance width (outside hips)
- Full pre-shot routine

**Execution:**
1. Take full backswing with proper lead leg alignment
2. Aggressive transition move: knee to ankle, hip stays back
3. "Put the brakes on" halfway down (approximately)
4. Stop motion abruptly with lead leg brace engaged
5. Check snapshot position: proper knee-ankle-hip relationship
6. Gradually increase speed while maintaining positions

**Success Markers:**
- Can stop downswing abruptly without losing balance
- Clear sensation of bracing against lead leg
- Position holds: knee over ankle, hip behind
- "Something to push against"

**Note:** This drill is for feel development - use sparingly as it removes stretch-shorten cycle benefits.

## Key Takeaways

1. **The "Knee Kick In" kills power generation** - When the lead knee kicks excessively inward at the top (trail femur vertical or past), it eliminates the ability to create a bracing mechanism during transition, forcing reliance on upper body and creating inconsistent contact.

2. **Maintain hip-knee-ankle alignment at top** - Even with a full turn and bent lead knee, the three key points (hip joint, knee center, ankle center) should remain in relative alignment, creating stretch in the hip flexor area and internal rotation sensation.

3. **Stance width matters for stability** - Driver stance must be definitely outside hip width to provide stable base for ground force generation; narrow stances may allow more turn but sacrifice power and consistency.

4. **Transition checkpoint: knee over ankle, hip behind** - The critical position for speed generation is lead shin vertical (knee over ankle) while hip joint stays inside/behind the knee, creating the "brace" or "breaks to hit from."

5. **Proper bracing created 20 yards of carry** - For this 57-year-old golfer, simply correcting lead leg position from top through impact added 20 yards of carry distance by allowing access to ground reaction forces previously blocked by faulty mechanics.

6. **Avoid excessive trail ankle roll** - Rolling trail ankle inward too much shoves golfer down fairway and straightens trail leg too soon; instead, twist foot to promote rotational knee movement, not lateral slide.

7. **The uppercut release completes the sequence** - After establishing proper brace and applying vertical force, final speed comes from release pattern where club "points back at you" through impact zone.

8. **If holding the top is comfortable, you're doing it wrong** - Proper load and stretch at the top should feel challenging to hold statically; comfort indicates insufficient energy storage in the system.

## Biomechanical Principles

**Ground Force Utilization:**
- Proper lead leg alignment allows maximum vertical force generation
- Force plate data demonstrates dramatic differences in force patterns
- "Breaking" action converts linear forces to rotational speed

**Kinematic Sequence:**
- Lower body must create stable base for upper body to accelerate against
- Faulty lead leg position "turns off" lower body contribution
- Optimal sequence requires proper bracing mechanics

**Stability vs. Mobility Trade-off:**
- Narrow stance: more mobility (turn), less stability (power)
- Optimal stance: sufficient width for stability while maintaining turn
- Individual variations exist, but principles remain constant

**Stretch-Shortening Cycle:**
- Proper top position creates elastic energy storage
- "Rubber band" effect from lead toe to hands
- Static holds useful for learning but must progress to dynamic motion

## AMG Scientific Perspective

This video exemplifies AMG's evidence-based approach using force plate technology to validate instruction. The case study methodology - showing dramatic results (20 yards carry) from specific biomechanical corrections - demonstrates how understanding ground reaction forces can unlock speed potential that traditional feels-based instruction often misses.

The emphasis on the three-point alignment system (hip-knee-ankle) provides measurable checkpoints rather than vague concepts. The distinction between "what's being taught" (lift heel, narrow stance) versus "what the data shows" (proper alignment, adequate width) highlights AMG's commitment to science over tradition.

The progression from static position drills to dynamic movement respects motor learning principles while acknowledging the importance of the stretch-shortening cycle in actual performance.
