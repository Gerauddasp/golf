## Overview

This short drill video addresses two common iron contact issues: fat shots and scooping. Using an impact bag, the drill focuses on proper body rotation (specifically trail hip movement) to deliver the club correctly, combined with face rotation technique to prevent leaving the clubface open when achieving proper shaft lean at impact.

## Key Concepts

### Impact Bag Drill for Body Rotation
- **Problem Addressed**: Fat shots and scoops caused by arm-dominant swing patterns
- **Equipment**: Impact bag (available from AMG website)
- **Primary Feel**: Trail side hip rotating around to bring club to the bag
- **Execution**: Hit the bag and "put on the brakes" at impact position
- **Key Distinction**: Body-driven delivery vs. pulling with arms (which causes scooping)

### Face Control with Shaft Lean
- **Issue**: When achieving proper shaft lean for the first time, golfers often leave the face open
- **Solution**: Add a "little twist" on the grip through impact
- **Visual Checkpoint**: Watch the Golf Pride logo on the grip rotate as you hit the bag
- **Timing**: The twist occurs as you're coming into impact and putting on the brakes

## Actionable Drills

### Impact Bag Hip Rotation Drill
**Purpose**: Eliminate fat shots and scooping by engaging proper body mechanics
**Setup**:
- Place impact bag in front of you (simulating ball position)
- Take normal iron address position

**Execution**:
1. Swing back normally
2. Feel the trail side hip rotating around to deliver the club
3. Hit the impact bag
4. "Put on the brakes" - stop at impact position
5. Avoid pulling with arms - let hip rotation bring the club through

**Success Markers**:
- Body stops at impact position
- Trail hip has rotated around
- No feeling of arm pull or hand scoop
- Solid contact with impact bag

### Face Rotation with Shaft Lean Drill
**Purpose**: Prevent leaving face open when achieving forward shaft lean
**Setup**:
- Same impact bag setup
- Note the logo on your grip (Golf Pride or similar marking)

**Execution**:
1. As you swing into the bag, add a small twist/rotation with the grip
2. Watch the grip logo rotate through impact
3. Put on the brakes at impact
4. Check that face is square (not open) at impact position

**Success Markers**:
- Visible grip rotation (logo turns)
- Clubface square at impact despite shaft lean
- No blocking right from open face
- Solid, crisp contact with bag

## Key Takeaways

1. **Body-Driven Impact**: Use trail hip rotation (not arm pull) to deliver the club to prevent scoops and fat shots
2. **Face Control**: Add grip twist through impact to square the face when achieving proper shaft lean
3. **Impact Position Training**: Use "put on the brakes" feeling to train proper impact position
4. **Visual Feedback**: Watch grip logo rotation to confirm proper face closure through impact

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Pulling with arms instead of rotating body - leads to scooping
- Stopping hip rotation too early - causes fat contact
- Forgetting face rotation when adding shaft lean - results in blocked shots right
- Excessive grip twist - should be a "little twist," not overrotation

## Equipment Notes

- Impact bag recommended (available from Athletic Motion Golf website)
- Standard iron for practice
- Grip with visible logo helps provide visual feedback for face rotation
