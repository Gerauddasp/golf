## Overview

This concept video addresses one of the most common misconceptions about impact position: the myth that golfers must "create space" by pushing the pelvis back and lowering the handle. Using GEARS 3D motion capture data, Mike and Sean reveal that tour professionals actually do the opposite—they move forward, rotate open, and raise the handle 2-3 inches higher than address. This counterintuitive reality creates light-bulb moments for golfers who've been fighting their natural biomechanics by trying to replicate incorrect mental models of impact.

The lesson demonstrates how fixing flawed concepts (rather than drilling mechanics) can produce immediate results, including one student hitting their first draw ever simply by understanding that the handle should be higher at impact, not lower.

## Key Biomechanical Concepts

### The Handle Position at Impact vs. Address

**Vertical Position**:
- Handle is **2-3 inches HIGHER** at impact than address
- This is NOT from lifting the arms—it's from body rotation and extension
- Left hip rises, shoulder rotates up and around → handle naturally elevates
- All tour players operate within this tight window

**Horizontal Position**:
- Handle moves **4-5 inches FORWARD** toward target (pelvis moves same amount)
- This forward shift coincides with pelvis translation
- Handle is also 2-3 inches closer to target line at impact

**Why This Happens**:
- Pelvis rotates and extends (posterior tilt/"tucking under")
- Body straightens on lead side
- Club releases radially (uncocking) while maintaining trail wrist extension
- These movements are biomechanically interdependent

### The "Create Space" Myth Debunked

**Common Amateur Concept** (WRONG):
- Push butt/pelvis back away from ball
- Lower hands to get "handle forward"
- Try to return to address position

**Tour Player Reality** (CORRECT):
- Right hip moves TOWARD the ball as pelvis rotates
- Left hip moves back corresponding amount (rotation, not translation away)
- Body moves forward 4 inches while rotating open
- Handle rises as natural consequence of body mechanics

**Why Amateurs Get This Wrong**:
- Misinterpret instruction to "get handle forward"
- Confuse shaft lean with handle height
- Think they need to create space from address position
- Don't realize tour players fill the space with their body

### The 80% Upward Motion Paradox

**Biomechanical Timeline**:
- Body's lowest point: Early in downswing (around transition)
- Body rises for approximately **80% of the downswing**
- Hands' lowest point: Much later (pre-impact zone)
- At impact: Body is extending upward, hands releasing downward

**Why This Matters**:
- To get 4-5 inches of forward shaft lean, you MUST release wrist angle
- Can't maintain full lag angle and move handle forward without:
  - Extreme body lowering (opposite of what tour players do)
  - Abnormal setup positions (Moe Norman, Bryson extreme examples)
  - Equipment compensations (usually ineffective)

**Mind Melt Prevention**:
- "Casting" fears prevent proper release
- Releasing radially ≠ losing shaft lean
- Trail wrist extension can remain while radial release occurs
- Uncocking actually squares the face (beneficial for draws)

## Common Misconceptions Corrected

### Misconception #1: "Keep the Handle Low"
**Problem**: Lower handle = bunker shot mechanics = scoop and flip
**Reality**: Higher handle = proper compression and clean contact
**Example**: Student trying to keep handle low had major flip. Told to feel "lower here (backswing) but higher here (impact)" → hit first draw of his life

### Misconception #2: "Return to Address Position"
**Problem**: Beginning golfers think impact = address position
**Reality**: Impact is 4-5 inches forward, 2-3 inches higher, pelvis rotated 40-50° open
**Consequence**: Trying to match address creates early extension, loss of posture

### Misconception #3: "Shaft Lean = Lower Hands"
**Problem**: Attempting shaft lean by lowering hands and pushing butt back
**Reality**: Shaft lean comes from forward body movement + proper release timing
**Equipment Reality**: Can't override biomechanics with 4-inch longer clubs or 10° upright lie angles—implements stop working

### Misconception #4: "Push Pelvis Back for Space"
**Problem**: Pushing everything back while preventing right hip from moving toward ball
**Reality**: Right hip moves toward ball ~3 inches, left hip moves back ~3 inches (rotation on axis)
**Result of Wrong Concept**: Contorted positions, back pain, inconsistent contact

## The Pose Drill (Conceptual Training)

### Purpose
Change mental model of impact rather than drilling mechanics

### Setup Phase
1. Start at normal address position
2. Mentally acknowledge your body position relative to ball

### Static Impact Pose
**Body Movements**:
- Move pelvis 4 inches toward target
- Rotate pelvis open (right hip toward ball, left hip back)
- Allow rear end to tuck under slightly (posterior tilt)
- Feel belt line rise slightly
- Keep trail wrist extended but allow radial release

**Handle Position Check**:
- Handle should be 2-3 inches higher than address
- Handle should be 4-5 inches forward of address
- Handle should be closer to target line
- You should NOT be lowering your arms—body rotation raises handle

### Execution Options

**Option 1: Static Hold**
- Pose the position at home
- Study the feels
- Get mind and body on same page
- Repeat until position feels natural

**Option 2: Chip from Pose**
- Set up at address
- Pose into impact position
- Make small backswing from there
- Chip through, maintaining elevated handle
- Feel club releasing out in front through impact

**Option 3: Progressive Swing**
- Pose impact position
- Make small takeaway
- Return to posed position
- Gradually increase swing length
- Let body movements (not arm manipulation) raise handle

### Success Markers
- Face squares easier (promotes draw)
- Center contact improves
- "Oh, this is way easier" response
- Body feels more natural, less contorted
- Compression improves without trying

## Scientific Validation Points

### GEARS Data Referenced
- Average tour player: 2-3 inches higher handle at impact
- Some tour players: Even more elevation
- Forward movement: 4-5 inches pelvis translation
- Upward movement duration: ~80% of downswing
- Tight window: All elite players within narrow range

### Biomechanical Constraints
**Why Tour Players Converge on This Pattern**:
- Shaft bends downward in swing (droop)
- Body must compensate for shaft dynamics
- Forward movement + rotation = natural handle rise
- Standard equipment specs work within this window
- Physics dictates efficient solutions

**Equipment Limits**:
- Can't go 4 inches long and maintain efficiency
- Can't go 10° upright and maintain functionality
- Extreme setups (Moe, Bryson) are rare outliers
- Standard specs = standard biomechanics work

### The "Tight Window" Concept
- Good and bad can both be overdone and underdone
- Tour players all operate within narrow range
- "There's not a million ways to do this"
- Individual variation exists within constraints
- But fundamentals (handle up and forward) are universal

## Practical Application Strategy

### Step 1: Correct Your Mental Model
**Current Wrong Concept**: Create space + lower handle = good impact
**Correct Concept**: Move forward + rotate + handle rises = good impact

### Step 2: Experience the Position
- Physically pose from address to impact
- Feel the difference (don't imagine it)
- Notice how different it is from what you were doing
- Let the wrongness of your old position sink in

### Step 3: Understand the Cause-Effect
**Body Motion → Handle Position** (NOT the reverse)
- Forward movement → forward shaft lean
- Rotation → handle elevation
- Extension → posterior tilt/tuck
- Radial release → face square + maintaining some shaft lean

### Step 4: Stop Fighting Natural Mechanics
**Things to STOP Doing**:
- Pushing butt back
- Lowering hands actively
- Trying to return to address position
- Preventing right hip from moving toward ball
- Maintaining full lag angle through impact

**Things to START Doing**:
- Moving forward toward target
- Rotating through impact
- Allowing handle to rise with rotation
- Letting radial release happen
- Trusting that shaft lean comes from timing, not position-holding

### Step 5: Practice the Concept, Not the Position
**Dana Dahlquist Wisdom**: "Best drill is just to do it right"
- Don't overcomplicate with drills
- Just adopt correct concept
- Make swings with new understanding
- Let natural biomechanics take over

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem: "I keep flipping when I lower my handle"
**Diagnosis**: Attempting wrong concept (lower handle = bunker shot mechanics)
**Solution**: Feel lower in backswing, higher at impact
**Why It Works**: Uncocking squares face naturally, eliminates compensatory flip

### Problem: "I'm too steep and stand the handle up"
**Diagnosis**: Steep plane forces handle rise, but wrong sequencing
**Solution**: First fix plane (get more shallow), THEN focus on handle through impact
**Why It Works**: Can't fix after-effects without addressing root cause

### Problem: "This feels like I'm coming up out of it"
**Diagnosis**: Your old pattern had you lowering through impact
**Solution**: Trust the data—80% of downswing is upward for tour players
**Why It Works**: Rising is correct; you were lowering incorrectly before

### Problem: "Won't this cause me to cast?"
**Diagnosis**: Confusing radial release with loss of lag
**Solution**: Understand you can release radially while maintaining trail wrist extension
**Why It Works**: Two different angles; releasing one doesn't lose the other

### Problem: "My back hurts doing it the old way"
**Diagnosis**: Pushing pelvis back creates contorted position
**Solution**: Allow right hip toward ball, natural rotation
**Why It Works**: Body in mechanically sound position it actually prefers

## Core Principles Summary

1. **Handle is 2-3 inches HIGHER at impact than address** (universal for tour players)

2. **Handle is 4-5 inches MORE FORWARD at impact than address** (pelvis moves same amount)

3. **Body rises for ~80% of downswing** (lowest point is early, not at impact)

4. **Right hip moves TOWARD ball** as pelvis rotates (not away from ball)

5. **Creating space = myth** (body fills the space; doesn't retreat from it)

6. **Handle elevation comes from body rotation**, not arm lifting

7. **Radial release is necessary** for proper impact (not casting)

8. **Every golfer can do this** (not outlandishly difficult; it's natural)

9. **Concepts matter more than drills** (wrong concept → fighting natural mechanics)

10. **All tour players operate in tight window** (there aren't a million ways to do this)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Myth Busting**: Tour players do NOT push their pelvis back and lower their hands at impact—they do the opposite

2. **The Real Numbers**: Handle is 2-3 inches higher and 4-5 inches forward at impact vs. address (measured with GEARS)

3. **Biomechanical Reality**: Body rises for 80% of the downswing; trying to lower through impact fights natural mechanics

4. **Concept Over Drill**: Changing your mental model (what you're trying to do) is more important than drilling positions

5. **Immediate Results Possible**: Students commonly hit their best shots ever (including first-time draws) simply by adopting correct impact concept

6. **Natural Movement**: When you stop trying to create space backward and allow natural forward rotation, the swing becomes easier on the body

7. **The Pose Drill**: Simply posing from address to proper impact position (without trying to add drills) can reprogram your concept

8. **Equipment Constraints**: Standard clubs work because tour players all converge on similar positions; extreme deviations don't work with standard equipment

9. **Release Confusion**: Releasing the club radially (uncocking) is NOT casting—it's necessary for proper impact and actually helps square the face

10. **Trust the Data**: Every golfer can have handle 2-3 inches higher at impact; this isn't difficult, outlandish, or only for tour players
