## Overview

This short instructional video addresses a common driver swing fault—getting the handle "too deep" in the downswing. AMG explains the biomechanical problem this creates and introduces a powerful swing thought using the "18-wheeler turning a corner" analogy to help golfers properly sequence their driver swing for optimal impact conditions.

## Key Concepts

### The Handle "Too Deep" Problem

**What It Means**:
- Handle positioned too far in front of the body during the downswing
- Shaft still parallel to the ground at this deep position
- Creates a "pulley motion" that makes proper impact alignment extremely difficult

**Why It's Problematic**:
- Very difficult to square the clubface at impact
- Forces the golfer to "back out of the shot" (early extension/standing up)
- Disrupts the natural delivery path of the club
- Makes consistent ball-striking nearly impossible

### Proper Driver Delivery Position

**Impact Goal**: Shaft vertical (straight up and down) at impact

**Setup Requirements**:
- Ball position: Forward in stance (front of front foot)
- Stance width: Wider than normal
- These fundamentals enable proper delivery geometry

### The 18-Wheeler Analogy

**Swing Thought**: Think of the driver swing like an 18-wheeler making a sharp turn

**Key Principles**:
- Large vehicles need wider turns and more time to navigate corners
- The driver (longest club, widest arc) needs similar accommodation
- Cannot rush the delivery—must give it time to "come around the corner"

## Actionable Techniques

### "Tickling the Grass" Delivery Feel

**Purpose**: Ensures early enough club release to allow proper sequencing

**The Feel**:
- Start delivering the club "a little bit sooner" in the downswing
- Sensation of "almost tickling the grass" as you come into the ball
- This creates time and space for the club to complete its arc

**Biomechanical Effect**:
- Prevents handle from getting too deep
- Allows clubhead to naturally release and square
- Creates proper shaft angle at impact (vertical)
- Enables upward angle of attack for optimal launch

### Timing Adjustment

**Mental Framework**: "Give it time to make its turn and come around the corner"

**Practical Application**:
- Don't rush the transition
- Allow the club to travel a wider arc
- Think "wide and early" rather than "steep and late"
- Let the clubhead naturally catch up to the handle

## Common Fault Correction

### From: Handle Too Deep
**Characteristics**:
- Handle ahead, shaft parallel to ground
- Pulley/stuck feeling
- Requires backing out to square face
- Inconsistent contact

### To: Proper Delivery
**Characteristics**:
- Earlier delivery initiation
- Grass-tickling sensation
- Shaft vertical at impact
- Natural, flowing release

## Key Takeaways

1. **Avoid "Handle Too Deep"**: Don't get the handle too far in front with the shaft still parallel—this creates an unsolvable geometry problem

2. **18-Wheeler Analogy**: Think of the driver swing as a large truck making a wide turn—it needs time and space to navigate the corner

3. **"Tickle the Grass" Feel**: Start delivering the club sooner in the downswing with the sensation of tickling the grass before impact

4. **Shaft Vertical Goal**: Strive for a vertical shaft position at impact, supported by proper ball position (forward) and stance width

5. **Give It Time**: The driver's long length and wide arc require patience—allow time for the club to "come around the corner"

## Biomechanical Insights

### Why This Works

**Arc Width Considerations**:
- Driver has longest shaft = widest swing arc
- Wider arcs require more time to complete
- Earlier delivery prevents geometric conflicts

**Shaft Angle at Impact**:
- Vertical shaft = optimal launch conditions
- Allows upward angle of attack (hit up on driver)
- Maximizes dynamic loft and ball speed

**Release Mechanics**:
- "Tickling grass" feel promotes passive release
- Prevents forced manipulation to square face
- Creates natural clubhead speed accumulation

## Skill Level

**Best For**: All levels, especially golfers who:
- Block or push drives
- Experience "stuck" feeling with driver
- Early extend through impact
- Struggle with consistent driver contact

## Related Concepts

- Angle of attack (upward with driver)
- Club delivery path
- Transition tempo and timing
- Early extension prevention
