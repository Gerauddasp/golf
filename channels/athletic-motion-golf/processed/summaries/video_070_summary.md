## Overview

This short instructional video provides a systematic approach to executing low-trajectory chip shots that land on the green and roll out to the hole. The technique focuses on specific setup modifications and swing mechanics that reduce loft at impact and promote a driving, forward-moving motion through the ball. The method emphasizes handle position, club face management, and body sequencing to create a low-flying shot that maximizes roll.

## Key Concepts

### Low Chip Shot Setup Fundamentals

**Ball Position**
- Position ball slightly back in stance (back of center)
- Creates descending angle of attack for clean contact

**Stance Configuration**
- Feet positioned close together (approximately one club width between heels)
- Lead toe turned out approximately 45 degrees
- Narrow stance promotes body rotation and stability

**Distance from Ball**
- Stand only about one foot away from the ball
- Closer proximity elevates handle position
- Higher handle position encourages shut face angle on backswing

### Club Face and Loft Management

**Backswing Face Angle**
- Closer stance naturally closes (shuts) the club face on takeaway
- Shut face position reduces effective loft at impact
- Maintains lower launch angle through impact zone

**Impact Dynamics**
- Use more of the leading edge rather than bounce
- Keep loft off the club through the hitting area
- Creates driving, forward-moving strike

### Swing Motion Mechanics

**Backswing Sequence**
- Body moves slightly forward during backswing
- This forward press loads into the lead side
- Sets up proper weight distribution for impact

**Through-Swing Club Control**
- Keep club head more in line with lead arm through impact
- Avoid releasing club head past hands (no flip)
- Contrasts with higher-lofted pitch shot release pattern
- Maintains forward shaft lean and reduced dynamic loft

**Shot Trajectory Characteristics**
- Low driving motion using leading edge
- Ball comes out low with minimal air time
- Maximizes roll distance to flag

## Actionable Drills

### Low Chip Shot Setup Drill

**Purpose**: Establish proper stance, ball position, and handle height for low chip execution

**Setup**:
1. Place alignment stick or club on ground to mark ball position (back of center)
2. Set up with feet one club width apart
3. Turn lead toe out 45 degrees
4. Position yourself approximately 12 inches from ball

**Execution**:
1. Hold club and verify handle is elevated due to close proximity
2. Make practice backswings to feel shut face position
3. Check that club face appears closed relative to normal chip setup
4. Repeat setup sequence 10 times to build muscle memory

**Success Markers**:
- Handle position noticeably higher than standard chip setup
- Club face visibly shut (closed) at top of backswing
- Comfortable, stable stance with good balance

### Forward Press and Body Motion Drill

**Purpose**: Develop the forward body movement on backswing that loads weight properly

**Setup**:
1. Assume low chip shot stance (narrow, lead toe out, ball back)
2. Place alignment stick or club parallel to target line
3. Position reference point at sternum/chest center

**Execution**:
1. Address ball in low chip setup
2. On backswing, allow body to drift slightly forward (toward target)
3. Feel weight loading into lead leg
4. Hold top of backswing and verify forward position
5. Complete 10 backswing-only repetitions

**Success Markers**:
- Sternum/chest moves 1-2 inches forward during backswing
- Weight feels loaded on lead side at top
- Hands and club remain behind ball position
- No reverse pivot or backward sway

### No-Release Impact Drill

**Purpose**: Learn to keep club head in line with lead arm through impact (no flip)

**Setup**:
1. Low chip shot stance
2. Ball teed very low or on firm ground
3. Focus target 10-15 feet away

**Execution**:
1. Make abbreviated backswing with forward body press
2. Through impact, actively maintain forward shaft lean
3. Feel club head staying behind hands through hitting zone
4. Lead arm and club shaft should form straight line or slight forward angle post-impact
5. Hit 15-20 shots focusing only on no-release motion

**Success Markers**:
- No cupping or flipping of lead wrist through impact
- Club head does not pass hands until well after ball contact
- Divot or contact mark is ahead of ball position (forward)
- Ball trajectory is noticeably lower than standard chip

### Leading Edge Contact Drill

**Purpose**: Develop feel for using leading edge rather than bounce for low chip shots

**Setup**:
1. Low chip shot stance on firm ground or tight lie
2. Remove tee - hit off ground
3. Target 15-20 feet away with room for roll

**Execution**:
1. Set up with standard low chip parameters (ball back, narrow stance, close proximity)
2. Make swings focusing on feeling leading edge contact turf
3. Ball should come off with minimal spin, low flight
4. Observe how ball reacts - should land and roll significantly
5. Hit 20-30 shots alternating between normal chip (bounce) and low chip (leading edge)

**Success Markers**:
- Clean, crisp contact sound (not chunked)
- Ball flight noticeably lower than bounce-contact chips
- Roll-to-air-time ratio heavily favors roll (3:1 or greater)
- Can consistently control distance with this technique

## Key Takeaways

1. **Setup modifications are critical**: Ball back, narrow stance (one club width), lead toe out 45°, and standing only one foot from ball creates foundation for low chip shot

2. **Closer proximity elevates handle and shuts face**: Standing nearer to ball raises hands and naturally closes club face on backswing, both reducing loft

3. **Forward body press on backswing loads lead side**: Slight forward movement during takeaway sets up proper weight distribution and descending strike

4. **No-release motion through impact maintains loft reduction**: Keep club head in line with lead arm through impact zone—avoid flipping or releasing like a pitch shot

5. **Use leading edge, not bounce**: This technique emphasizes forward-driving contact with leading edge rather than bounce interaction, creating low, running trajectory

6. **Contrast with pitch shot mechanics**: Low chip requires opposite release pattern from higher-lofted pitch shots—maintain shaft lean vs. allowing club to release

7. **Shot characteristics**: Expect low launch, significant roll, and driving forward motion—ideal for firm greens or when running ball to back pin positions

- Bounce vs. leading edge contact dynamics
- Weight distribution and forward press mechanics
- Dynamic loft management through setup and swing modifications
- Trajectory control for varying green conditions

## Application Notes

**Ideal Situations**:
- Firm, fast greens
- Running ball to back pin locations
- Into the wind conditions
- Tight lies requiring clean, descending contact

**When to Avoid**:
- Soft, receptive greens where spin is needed
- Short-sided situations requiring height and stop
- When obstacle clearance is minimal
- Uphill lies where added loft is beneficial
