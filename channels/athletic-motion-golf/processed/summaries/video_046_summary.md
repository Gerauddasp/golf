## Overview

Athletic Motion Golf debunks one of the most popular and persistent drills in golf instruction - the drill where golfers use a shaft extension (or alignment stick through the club) and try to prevent it from hitting their side during the downswing. Despite its continued popularity, this drill teaches the exact opposite of what actually happens in an efficient golf swing. The instructors explain why this drill is counterproductive and how shaft lean should actually be created as a natural byproduct of proper swing mechanics rather than a deliberate manipulation.

## Key Concepts

### The Popular But Wrong Drill
- **The Setup**: Backswing with shaft pointing at the target line (acceptable)
- **The Problem**: Downswing instruction to keep the shaft extension from hitting the lead side
- **Why It's Wrong**: This teaches golfers to pull their arms across their body to create shaft lean
- **The Reality**: "It's literally the opposite of what happens" in an efficient golf swing
- **Severity**: "If that was a sword, it would cut you right in two" - emphasizes how far from reality this drill is

### The Truth About Shaft Lean
- **Not Consciously Created**: Shaft lean is a byproduct, not a deliberate action
- **Never Discussed in Lessons**: "We never even talk about shaft lean in a lesson"
- **Natural Development**: Players who had no shaft lean can develop it naturally through proper mechanics
- **Proper Focus**: Work on correct impact positions rather than trying to manipulate shaft angles
- **Automatic Result**: When swing fundamentals are correct, shaft lean appears automatically

### Why This Drill Fails
- **Doesn't Transfer**: The drill movement doesn't translate to actual golf swings
- **Wrong Mental Model**: Creates misconception about how shaft lean is generated
- **Counterproductive**: Actively teaches incorrect movement patterns
- **Impact Position Confusion**: Trying to "fix" impact positions this way is "a disaster"
- **Pulling Across**: The drill encourages pulling arms across the body, which is not how shaft lean is created

## Biomechanical Analysis

### What Actually Creates Shaft Lean
- **Natural Body Mechanics**: Proper rotation and sequencing create shaft lean automatically
- **Not Arm Manipulation**: Shaft lean is NOT created by consciously pulling arms across the body
- **Byproduct of Efficiency**: Result of correct kinematic sequence and ground force interaction
- **Unconscious Movement**: Best players don't think about creating shaft lean
- **Proper Sequencing**: Lower body leads, upper body follows, shaft lean appears naturally

### The Drill's Mechanical Flaw
- **Contradicts Reality**: Teaches movement opposite to what happens in efficient swings
- **Conscious vs. Unconscious**: Attempts to make conscious what should be unconscious
- **Cause vs. Effect**: Confuses the cause (proper mechanics) with the effect (shaft lean)
- **Movement Pattern**: Encourages incorrect neuromuscular patterns

## Coaching Philosophy

### AMG's Approach to Shaft Lean
- **Focus on Fundamentals**: Work on ground forces, rotation, and sequencing
- **Let It Happen**: Don't force or manipulate shaft angles
- **Natural Development**: "That's how it should work" - as a byproduct
- **Real Results**: Players develop shaft lean without thinking about it
- **Proof of Concept**: Student with no shaft lean gained significant shaft lean in one lesson without discussing it

### What to Focus On Instead
- **Impact Positions**: Proper body positions at impact
- **Ground Force Utilization**: How the body interacts with the ground
- **Rotational Mechanics**: Efficient rotation patterns
- **Kinematic Sequence**: Proper timing and sequencing of body segments
- **Natural Movement**: Allow athletic movements to occur without conscious manipulation

## Key Takeaways

1. **STOP the shaft extension drill** - It teaches the exact opposite of reality and doesn't transfer to your golf swing
2. **Shaft lean is a byproduct** - It's the result of proper mechanics, not a deliberate manipulation
3. **Don't pull arms across** - Trying to create shaft lean by pulling arms across the body is incorrect
4. **Focus on impact positions** - Work on proper body positions rather than shaft angles
5. **Trust the process** - When fundamentals are correct, shaft lean appears automatically without conscious effort
6. **Natural development** - Players can develop significant shaft lean in a single lesson when working on the right things

## Training Implications

### What NOT to Do
- ❌ Use shaft extensions or alignment sticks to prevent hitting your side
- ❌ Consciously try to pull arms across body to create shaft lean
- ❌ Focus on manipulating shaft angles during the swing
- ❌ Spend practice time on drills that don't transfer to real swings

### What TO Do Instead
- ✅ Work on proper impact body positions
- ✅ Focus on ground force utilization and rotation
- ✅ Develop proper kinematic sequencing
- ✅ Allow shaft lean to appear naturally as a result of good mechanics
- ✅ Trust that fixing fundamentals will create desired shaft positions automatically

## Related Concepts
- Kinematic sequence and timing
- Ground force reaction patterns
- Shaft lean as effect vs. cause
- Transfer of training drills to actual swing
- Conscious vs. unconscious movement control
- Impact position fundamentals

## Warning Signs You're Doing This Wrong
- Actively thinking about keeping shaft from hitting your side
- Feeling like you're pulling arms across your body
- Creating shaft lean through manipulation rather than rotation
- Drill movements that feel unnatural or forced
- No improvement in ball striking despite "correct" shaft lean in drill
