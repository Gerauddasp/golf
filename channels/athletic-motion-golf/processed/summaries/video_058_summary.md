## Overview

This video dismantles one of golf's most persistent misconceptions: that body rotation squares the clubface and creates shaft lean. Using biomechanical data from millions of swings, AMG demonstrates that while good players may *feel* like they're squaring the face with body rotation, the reality is measurably different. From shaft parallel to impact, even the most rotational players on Tour rotate very little, while the clubface must rotate 45-65 degrees to square up. The solution lies in mastering three essential wrist movements: ulnar deviation (uncocking), supination (rotation), and extension. The instructors emphasize that golfers who obsessively work on maintaining shaft lean through "no-flip" drills are actually preventing the natural wrist movements required for proper impact conditions.

## Key Concepts

### The Body Rotation Myth

**The Claim**: Body swingers believe they're squaring the clubface with body rotation
**The Reality**:
- This is "factually, measurably never the case"
- From shaft parallel to impact, body rotates a very small amount (even for highest rotators on Tour)
- Clubface must rotate 45-65 degrees relative to path in those few milliseconds
- Body rotation actually *opens* the clubface (per TPI's Greg Rose)
- Better body rotation = more open face (why faders use strong grips and closed face positions)

**Key Quote**: "If you don't know how to get that club face square, turning like a top's not going to do it."

### The Jim McLean Teaching Progression

**Philosophy**: Two-stage learning approach
1. **Stage 1 (Beginners/Improvers)**: Must first learn proper hand and arm action
2. **Stage 2 (Advanced)**: Once hands/arms are trained, swing becomes more body-driven and hands can be "along for the ride"

**Reality Check**: Good players have learned hands/arms so well they don't have to *think* about them - but the movements still happen. Five to 15 handicappers don't have that luxury of automatic hand action.

### The Three Essential Wrist Movements

**Movement 1: Ulnar Deviation (Uncocking)**
- Lead wrist must uncock/"ner deviate" to reach the ball
- At address: Lead wrist is in ulnar deviation (uncocked)
- At impact: Must return to at least that position (most Tour players go beyond)
- Visual check: Club butt starts at belt buckle, rises above it by impact
- Why it's required: Body extends through impact (rear tucking, lead side stretching) - only way to reach ball is releasing this angle

**Movement 2: Supination (Forearm Rotation)**
- Required to square the clubface
- Feel: "Hitting the back of something with back of left hand" going into extension
- Cannot square face with uncocking alone - face would stay wide open
- This provides the massive rotation required (45-65 degrees)

**Movement 3: Extension**
- Lead wrist extends through impact
- Required for proper release and trajectory
- Contributes to clubhead speed
- Allows club to release properly without "under and in" pattern

**Critical Point**: "It's not this [flip]. It is not this [flip]." - The movements happen through proper sequencing and body positioning, not manipulative flipping.

### Ideal Delivery Position (Shaft Parallel Downswing)

**Club Face Position**:
- Slightly toe down (not laid open, not pancake flat)
- 15-20 degree window optimal
- Somewhat grip-dependent
- Gives plenty of time to square the face

**Body Position Test**: If you froze at shaft parallel and only rotated body (no wrist action), you'd miss the ball. This proves wrists must do something independent of body rotation.

### The "Set It and Forget It" Fallacy

**The Problem**: Belief that you can preset wrist angles and maintain them through impact
- Punch shot drills don't transfer to full swings
- Thinking hands return to address position creates "kicking motion"
- Fear of "casting" causes golfers to fight against necessary movements
- Works for punch shots, but "what do you do when you get to driver?"

**The Reality**: Every professional measured does all three wrist movements through impact

### Timing vs. Position

**The Fix Isn't**: Manipulating the wrists actively
**The Fix Is**: "Learning to time and position the body so that this motion right here... comes out later"

- Every golfer does these movements through impact
- Bad: Doing them *before* impact (early release)
- Good: Positioning body so movements happen *at* impact
- Body supports and stabilizes - doesn't do the squaring

## Biomechanical Data Points

### Tour Player Measurements
- From shaft parallel to impact: minimal body rotation (even for highest rotators)
- Clubface: 45-65 degrees open at shaft parallel
- All measured professionals perform all three wrist movements
- Most amateur golfers are "short on the ulnar" - not uncocking enough

### Common Deficiency Pattern
- Golfers obsessed with maintaining shaft lean typically lack actual shaft lean
- Those working "nonstop" on anti-flip drills are usually the ones without proper release
- Teaching proper wrist action often produces shaft lean "for the first time" immediately

### The Fader Pattern
- Strong grip (closed face at address)
- Use body rotation to offset the closed face
- Need ball to start left of target
- Demonstrates that body rotation opens the face

## Diagnostic Protocol

### Video Analysis Checkpoints

**At Shaft Parallel (Delivery)**:
1. Clubface: 15-20 degrees toe down?
2. Body rotation alone: Would you miss the ball? (Should be yes)
3. Wrist angles: Proper preparation for release?

**Through Impact**:
1. Ulnar deviation: Club butt rising above belt buckle?
2. Supination: Clubface squaring?
3. Extension: Proper release trajectory?
4. Hand path: Circular with clubhead staying out front?
5. Club shaft: Pointing diagonal to target line (at belly button), never perpendicular?

### HackMotion Assessment
- Tool to measure wrist angles objectively
- Will reveal which of three movements you're missing
- Most golfers deficient in ulnar deviation (uncocking)
- Many missing all three movements

## Practice Implementation

### The Teaching Sequence

**Step 1**: Establish decent grip
**Step 2**: Teach proper pivot/body movement
**Step 3**: Show wrist motion - "you can actually do this and get the club pointed back at you"
**Result**: "Boom. The first swing after we show it to them a lot of times on video they have shaft lean for the first time"

### Starting Point Drill

**Position**: Shaft parallel on downswing
**Process**:
1. Get into proper shaft parallel position (clubface slightly toe down)
2. Feel amount of ulnar deviation needed
3. Say "Okay, I don't think I'm doing enough"
4. Practice getting that movement started first
5. Then let body turn naturally
6. May feel like body is squaring it - but know that's not what's actually happening

**Success Marker**: Clubhead stays out in front, hand path circles but club maintains proper arc aligned with hand path

### The Interconnection Benefit

"The cool part about the ulnar [deviation], too, if I uncock my wrist enough, it actually starts wanting to work a little bit and to flatten the wrist. And oh, by the way, the face will square up a little easier."

- Proper uncocking facilitates the other movements
- Movements work synergistically
- Natural sequencing emerges from proper initiation

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Body Rotation Focus
- **Error**: Believing body rotation squares the face
- **Reality**: Body provides support and positioning for the wrist action
- **Fix**: Understand body "positions the body to support the throw"

### Mistake 2: Maintaining Address Positions
- **Error**: Trying to return hands to address position
- **Reality**: Creates "kicking motion" of clubhead
- **Fix**: Accept that impact hand position is different (higher) than address

### Mistake 3: Fear of Casting
- **Error**: Fighting against any uncocking motion
- **Reality**: Prevents necessary ulnar deviation to reach ball
- **Fix**: Distinguish between proper release and early casting (timing issue)

### Mistake 4: Punch Shot Over-Practice
- **Error**: Excessive punch shot drills thinking they'll transfer
- **Reality**: Doesn't transfer to full swing dynamics
- **Fix**: Learn proper full-swing wrist action instead

### Mistake 5: Missing Even One Movement
- **Error**: Having two of three wrist movements but missing one
- **Reality**: "You can have the best body movement in the world. If you're missing those arm pieces... you're not going to square the face"
- **Fix**: Ensure all three movements present

## The Speed Connection

### Why Proper Release Creates Speed

**Mechanical Reality**: "If I want to hit something hard, I want the butt of the club to point back at me"
- Not through manipulation
- Natural result of turning implement around body center
- Club pointing back at belly = outside circle moving fast
- Diagonal to target line (never perpendicular)

**Energy Transfer**: The extension and release through impact are integral to:
- Maximum clubhead speed
- Proper trajectory
- Ball compression
- Distance potential

## Key Takeaways

1. **Body rotation does not square the clubface** - it provides support and positioning for wrist action that does the squaring

2. **Three essential wrist movements required**: ulnar deviation (uncocking), supination (rotation), and extension - missing any one prevents proper impact

3. **All measured professionals perform all three movements** - there aren't multiple ways to make the club work correctly at impact

4. **Shaft lean comes from proper wrist action, not from fighting release** - golfers obsessing over maintaining angles typically lack shaft lean

5. **Timing beats position** - focus on positioning body so wrist movements happen at correct moment, not preventing them

6. **The progression matters**: beginners must learn hand/arm action first, then can integrate body-driven feel later

7. **Most amateurs are deficient in ulnar deviation** - not uncocking enough to reach ball with extended body position

8. **Clubface must rotate 45-65 degrees from delivery to impact** - body rotates minimally in same timeframe

9. **Hand path is circular but clubhead stays forward** - release is out front, not under and in

10. **Use video and HackMotion for objective feedback** - you're likely missing movements you think you're making

## AMG Teaching Philosophy Highlights

**Data-Driven Approach**: "Got a computer over there that's got millions and millions of data points on golfers that don't play for a living. Regular golfers."

**Real-World Application**: "We're actually still teaching all the time. We're using this stuff in real lessons. This is what works for real golfers."

**Breaking Bad Patterns**: Golfers who've worked endlessly on shaft lean drills without success often get shaft lean immediately after being taught proper wrist action

**Simplification Through Understanding**: Rather than trying to fix shaft lean directly, teach the component movements that naturally produce it
