## Overview

This video addresses a critical refinement to Athletic Motion Golf's previous teaching on hip depth in the backswing. While earlier content emphasized moving the trail hip back to prevent early extension, many golfers misapplied this by "popping" the hip back, which drove the upper body forward and left. AMG presents a more effective approach: controlling the upper body to naturally dictate proper pelvis movement. The key finding from tour data is that the trail shoulder moves up and back MORE than the lead shoulder moves down and forward - a ratio most golfers drastically underestimate. By keeping the lead shoulder on a tighter arc (feeling like turning "behind a fence"), golfers automatically achieve proper hip depth, eliminate early extension, and create a more efficient pivot sequence.

This represents AMG's evolution in teaching methodology: rather than trying to directly control the pelvis (which has limited proprioceptive feedback), they now prioritize shoulder movement patterns that organically produce the desired pelvic action. The video demonstrates measurable improvements using their swing coach app, showing a 3-degree change in hip depth simply by modifying shoulder arc awareness.

## Key Concepts

### Trail Shoulder Dominance in Backswing Turn

**The Tour Data Reality**
- Trail shoulder moves up and back MORE than lead shoulder moves down and forward
- The ratio is NOT 1:1 - it's significantly more movement on the trail side
- Most amateur golfers dramatically underestimate this asymmetry
- This pattern is universal among elite ball-strikers

**Visual Checkpoint**
- Film yourself down-the-line
- Draw a vertical line from the front of your lead shoulder at address
- At the top of backswing: MORE body mass should be behind this line than came forward past it
- If equal amounts cross forward and back, you're still doing it wrong

**Biomechanical Cause-and-Effect**
- Proper shoulder arc FORCES the pelvis to move correctly
- When lead shoulder stays on tighter arc, trail hip must go back
- This gets more torso mass behind the ball at the top
- Creates proper "loading" sensation in backswing

### The Upper Body Controls the Lower Body

**Awareness Advantage**
- Most golfers have better proprioceptive awareness of shoulders/arms than pelvis
- Shoulders move through larger range of motion = easier to feel
- Controlling what you can feel better = more reliable results
- This is why AMG shifted teaching emphasis from hips to shoulders

**The Linkage System**
- Lead shoulder arc determines pelvis movement
- Tight lead shoulder arc = trail hip goes back
- Wide lead shoulder arc = pelvis drifts forward
- You cannot have proper hip depth with improper shoulder arc

**The Sway Connection**
- Same principle applies to lateral sway issues
- If lead shoulder goes "down and left," trail hip kicks forward
- If lead shoulder moves "across," trail hip can stay back
- Upper body movement patterns create lower body positions

### Common Movement Errors That Ruin Shoulder Arc

**Left Knee Down and Forward**
- Pulls everything out past the vertical reference line
- Drives lead shoulder on too-wide arc
- Prevents trail hip from going back
- Common in golfers trying to "load into the ground"

**Hands In, Club Out**
- Creates same problem as knee thrust
- Lead shoulder pushed forward on arc
- Torso mass tips out over the ball
- Often accompanied by steep shaft at top

**Trying to Make a "Bigger Turn"**
- General awareness of "turn more" often executed incorrectly
- Golfers rotate but also drift forward
- More rotation should be "back and behind," not "out and around"
- Quantity of turn less important than direction of turn

**Locked Trail Leg with Shove**
- The "Pac-Man angle" AMG has discussed previously
- Straightening trail leg without proper hip movement
- Pushes everything forward instead of back
- Common in golfers with flexibility limitations

### The "Fence Feel" Training Method

**Mental Imagery**
- Imagine a fence directly in front of you at address
- Goal: Turn "behind" the fence with minimal body parts touching it
- Prevents the drift/drift pattern (forward upper body movement)
- Creates sensation of winding up vs. reaching out

**Feel vs. Real**
- Sean explicitly notes: "This is feel, not real"
- The sensation is exaggerated compared to actual movement
- Feeling like you're turning "behind a wall" produces proper mechanics
- Golfers often need to over-feel the correction initially

**Application for Different Body Types**
- "Top-heavy" golfers may need to counter-balance
- If you naturally lean forward, must actively work opposite direction
- Individual adjustments needed based on tendency
- The goal (mass behind line) is constant, but feels vary

## Measurable Outcomes from Proper Technique

### Swing Coach App Data - Sean's Demonstration

**"Old Way" Swing (Incorrect)**
- Hips at top: Forward by 2 degrees
- Shoulders: In acceptable window but hips mispositioned
- Result: Too much mass forward, early extension risk

**"New Way" Swing (Correct)**
- Hips at top: Back by 1 degree
- 3-degree total change by focusing on shoulder arc
- Pivot feels "tighter" and more efficient
- Improved ability to sequence downswing from hips

**What Changed**
- Mental focus: Tighter circle with lead shoulder
- Feel: Trail shoulder winding back vs. reaching around
- Reference: Thinking about GEARS dots trajectory on pressure suit
- Result: Automatic hip depth improvement

### Benefits Beyond Hip Depth

**Eliminates Early Extension**
- Proper shoulder arc prevents early thrust pattern
- Mass stays behind, reducing need to stand up in downswing
- More consistent low point control

**Eliminates Early Thrust**
- Hip depth at top allows proper sequencing
- Can initiate downswing with hip rotation vs. thrust
- Better separation between upper and lower body

**Improved Sequencing**
- Sean reports: "I feel like I can unwind the sequence better"
- Can start downswing with hips "with a little more speed"
- Tighter backswing creates better release of stored energy

## Diagnostic and Training Protocol

### Step 1: Film and Assess

**Camera Setup**
- Down-the-line view (caddie angle)
- Camera at hip height
- Ensure you can see full shoulder turn

**Analysis Method**
1. Freeze video at top of backswing
2. Draw vertical line from front of lead shoulder at address
3. Assess: Is more body mass behind the line or in front of it?
4. Quantify if possible: How much shoulder moved back vs. forward?

**Diagnosis Decision Tree**
- IF mass is equal front and back → Need correction
- IF more mass forward than back → Definitely need correction
- IF already more mass behind than forward → This is not your issue (don't fix what isn't broken)

### Step 2: Implement the Feel (If Needed)

**The Fence Drill**
1. Set up to ball normally
2. Imagine fence 6 inches in front of your chest
3. Make backswing trying to "turn behind fence"
4. Minimize how much body touches imaginary fence
5. Feel trail shoulder going "up and back" aggressively

**Alternative Feel: Tighter Circle**
- Think about lead shoulder tracing smaller circle
- Don't let it swing "out over the ball"
- Keep it more "across and back"
- Trail side will automatically respond correctly

**GEARS Dot Visualization** (Advanced)
- Reference: AMG's pressure suit with tracking dots
- Visualize dot on sternum/center chest
- That dot should curve back and behind, not out and around
- Helpful for those familiar with 3D motion capture data

### Step 3: Verify with Measurement

**Use Technology**
- Swing coach apps with hip depth tracking
- Down-the-line video with vertical reference line
- Looking for measurable change in hip position at top

**Success Criteria**
- Hip depth increases (trail hip more back)
- Shoulder plane stays sound (don't just stand up)
- Feel of "tighter pivot" in backswing
- Improved sequence feel in transition

## Actionable Drills

### Drill 1: Vertical Line Self-Assessment

**Purpose**: Accurately diagnose if this is your issue
**Equipment**: Camera/phone, video analysis app with line drawing
**Frequency**: One-time diagnostic, periodic re-check

**Execution**
1. Set up camera down-the-line at hip height
2. Make 3-5 full swings with 7-iron
3. Choose best representative swing
4. Freeze frame at top of backswing
5. Draw vertical line from front edge of lead shoulder at address
6. Extend line through entire frame
7. Assess body mass distribution relative to line

**Success Markers**
- Accurate self-diagnosis
- Clear understanding of your current pattern
- Baseline measurement for future comparison

**Coaching Notes**
- Be honest in assessment - denial helps no one
- If mass is equal, you still need improvement (should be MORE back)
- Compare to tour pro swings to calibrate your eye

### Drill 2: Fence Feel Rehearsal Swings

**Purpose**: Ingrain proper lead shoulder arc pattern
**Equipment**: None (mental imagery drill)
**Frequency**: 10 rehearsal swings before hitting balls

**Setup**
1. Take normal address position
2. Visualize fence 6 inches in front of your chest
3. Fence runs parallel to target line
4. Fence extends from ground to above your head

**Execution**
1. Make slow-motion backswing
2. Actively focus on NOT pressing forward against imaginary fence
3. Feel lead shoulder moving "back behind fence"
4. Feel trail shoulder going "up and back aggressively"
5. Pause at top - sense how little of you is touching fence
6. Gradually increase speed while maintaining feel

**Success Markers**
- Distinct sensation of turning "behind" vs. "around"
- Feeling of loading into trail side more than usual
- Automatic desire to move trail hip back
- Tighter, more compact feeling at top

**Progression**
- Start with rehearsals (no ball)
- Progress to small swings with ball (50% speed)
- Build to full swings maintaining the feel
- Eventually integrate into pre-shot routine

---

### Drill 3: Contrast Swings - Old vs. New

**Purpose**: Lock in proprioceptive difference between patterns
**Equipment**: Practice balls, optional video for feedback
**Frequency**: Every practice session during integration phase

**Execution - "Wrong Way" Swing**
1. Set up to ball
2. Deliberately let lead shoulder swing "out and over" the ball
3. Feel lead knee thrust down and forward
4. Notice how this feels in body (particularly hips and shoulders)
5. Make full swing, note ball flight

**Execution - "Right Way" Swing**
2. Set up to next ball
3. Implement fence feel - lead shoulder back
4. Feel trail shoulder up and back aggressively
5. Notice contrasting sensation (particularly hips and shoulders)
6. Make full swing, note ball flight

**Success Markers**
- Clear proprioceptive distinction between patterns
- "Wrong way" feels loose, drifty, less powerful
- "Right way" feels tight, coiled, more loaded
- Ball flight typically more solid with new pattern

**Sets and Reps**
- 3 sets of contrast swings (wrong/right/wrong/right)
- Then 10 swings with correct pattern only
- Repeat if feel degrades

### Drill 4: Trail Shoulder Awareness Pump

**Purpose**: Isolate and feel trail shoulder "up and back" movement
**Equipment**: Mirror (optional but helpful)
**Frequency**: Daily, especially before rounds

**Setup**
1. Address position without club
2. Hands in golf posture position
3. Mirror to your right if available

**Execution**
1. Keep lead shoulder relatively quiet
2. Focus 100% attention on trail shoulder
3. Move trail shoulder "up and back" in isolation
4. Feel it move MORE than lead shoulder moves down/forward
5. Exaggerate the movement initially
6. Gradually integrate into full turn motion

**Success Markers**
- Can isolate trail shoulder movement
- Understand "up and back" is NOT just up (must have back component)
- Feel asymmetry - trail side moves more than lead side
- When you add full turn, trail shoulder still dominant

**Variations**
- With club in hands
- With trail hand only on club
- In slow-motion backswing
- In full-speed swings

---

### Drill 5: Hip Depth Verification Hits

**Purpose**: Confirm shoulder change produces hip depth change
**Equipment**: Swing analysis app with hip depth measurement, hitting area
**Frequency**: Once every 2-3 practice sessions during integration

**Setup**
1. Configure app to track "hip depth at top of backswing"
2. Set camera down-the-line, hip height
3. Have 10 balls ready

**Execution - Baseline**
1. Make 3 swings with OLD pattern (if you remember it)
2. Note hip depth measurements
3. Note average position (likely forward or neutral)

**Execution - New Pattern**
1. Implement fence feel / tight shoulder arc
2. Make 7 swings with proper technique
3. Note hip depth measurements
4. Calculate average improvement

**Success Markers**
- Measurable increase in hip depth (trail hip more back)
- Improvement of 2-4 degrees typical
- Consistency across multiple swings
- No degradation of shoulder plane (don't just stand up)

**Troubleshooting**
- If hips don't change: Likely still letting lead shoulder drift forward
- If hips go back but you stand up: Too much spine extension, need rotation
- If inconsistent: Feel not yet ingrained, continue fence drill

### Drill 6: GEARS Dot Visualization

**Purpose**: Advanced mental model for proper center-mass movement
**Equipment**: Understanding of 3D motion capture concepts
**Frequency**: Mental drill, can be done anytime

**Conceptual Setup**
- Imagine tracking dot on center of your chest (sternum)
- This dot represents your torso mass center
- In proper swing, this dot moves in specific 3D path

**Visualization**
1. Address: Dot is in neutral position
2. Backswing: Dot curves BACK and BEHIND, not out and around
3. Top: Dot should be several inches behind starting position
4. Downswing: Dot stays back longer, then rotates

**Application to Swing**
1. Before swing, visualize correct dot path
2. During backswing, feel your center mass moving that path
3. Check: Does center feel like it's winding back vs. drifting out?
4. Use feel to guide movement pattern

**Success Markers**
- Can clearly visualize difference between correct/incorrect path
- Body responds to visualization with proper movement
- Helps maintain awareness during full-speed swings
- Bridges gap between technical understanding and execution

## Technical Specifications

### Tour Player Shoulder Movement Ratios

**Asymmetrical Turn Pattern**
- Trail shoulder displacement: Greater magnitude up and back
- Lead shoulder displacement: Lesser magnitude down and forward
- Ratio: Approximately 60-70% of turn comes from trail side movement
- This is OPPOSITE what most amateurs produce

**Spatial Reference Points**
- Vertical line from lead shoulder at address = reference plane
- At top: Tour pros have significantly more mass behind plane than in front
- Visual estimate: 2-3x more shoulder behind than in front of line
- This isn't subtle - it's a dramatic asymmetry

### Hip Depth Specifications from Demo

**Measurement Context**
- "Hip depth at top" refers to how far trail hip has moved back
- Measured in degrees from address position
- Positive number = hips forward; Negative number = hips back

**Sean's Numbers**
- Old pattern: Forward by 2 degrees (undesirable)
- New pattern: Back by 1 degree (desirable)
- Total change: 3 degrees difference
- Achieved by changing shoulder focus only, not direct hip manipulation

**Target Ranges** (AMG general guidelines)
- Recreational golfers: Neutral to 2 degrees back
- Better players: 1-3 degrees back
- Tour players: 2-4 degrees back typically
- Excess (>5 back): Can create reverse spine angle issues

## Common Mistakes and Corrections

### Mistake 1: "Popping" the Trail Hip Back

**The Problem**
- Directly trying to push trail hip back without shoulder awareness
- Upper body compensates by moving forward and left
- Creates worse position than original problem
- Common when applying AMG's earlier hip depth teaching without nuance

**Why It Happens**
- Taking one piece of instruction (hip depth) without context
- Poor proprioceptive awareness of pelvis
- Trying to force position rather than create it naturally

**The Fix**
- Stop thinking about hips directly
- Focus entirely on lead shoulder staying back
- Let hips respond to shoulder movement
- Trust the linkage system

---

### Mistake 2: Just Standing Up to Get Mass Back

**The Problem**
- Extending spine to move mass backward
- Reduces rotation, increases extension
- Destroys shoulder plane angle
- Defeats purpose of proper turn

**Why It Happens**
- Misunderstanding "up and back" as just "up"
- Lack of rotational mobility
- Not understanding turn should be around spine angle

**The Fix**
- Maintain spine angle throughout backswing
- "Up and back" means back is the priority
- If can't rotate back while maintaining posture, mobility work needed
- Check shoulder plane stays on reasonable angle (not too flat)

---

### Mistake 3: Overthinking Multiple Body Parts

**The Problem**
- Trying to monitor hips AND shoulders simultaneously
- Mental overload leads to mechanical swing
- Paralysis by analysis
- Loss of athletic motion

**Why It Happens**
- Desire to "get everything perfect"
- Not trusting cause-and-effect relationships
- Working on too many things at once

**The Fix**
- Pick ONE focus: Lead shoulder arc
- Trust that correct shoulder movement produces correct hip movement
- Film to verify, don't try to feel everything at once
- Simplify swing thought to single image (fence, tight circle, etc.)

---

### Mistake 4: Fixing a Non-Problem

**The Problem**
- Golfer already has good mass behind line at top
- Tries to implement this instruction anyway
- Makes swing worse by over-doing something already good
- Classic case of "if it ain't broke, don't fix it"

**Why It Happens**
- Not filming/assessing current swing first
- Assuming every tip applies to every golfer
- Fear of missing out on improvement

**The Fix**
- ALWAYS film and assess first (as AMG emphasizes in video)
- If you already have mass behind line, this isn't your issue
- Work on what YOU need, not what worked for someone else
- Trust AMG's diagnostic-first approach

## Integration with Previous AMG Content

### Relationship to Early Extension Series

**Previous Teaching**
- Trail hip must go back as much as lead hip goes forward
- Prevents early extension / early thrust
- Creates proper depth at top of backswing

**This Video's Refinement**
- Same goal (hip depth), better method (shoulder focus)
- Addresses misapplication of previous instruction
- More reliable due to better proprioception
- Evolution of teaching based on student feedback

**Combined Approach**
1. Understand the goal: Hip depth prevents early extension
2. Understand the mechanism: Proper shoulder arc creates hip depth
3. Apply the feel: Fence drill / tight lead shoulder circle
4. Verify with measurement: Film or use app

---

### Connection to Pac-Man Angle Concept

**The Pac-Man Angle**
- Trail leg locks and pushes
- Creates specific angular relationship at pelvis
- Pushes everything forward
- Discussed in multiple previous AMG videos

**How This Content Prevents It**
- Proper shoulder arc prevents locked trail leg issue
- When lead shoulder stays back, trail leg must flex
- Can't create Pac-Man angle with correct shoulder movement
- Another example of upper body controlling lower body

---

### Builds on GEARS Data Understanding

**AMG's 3D Analysis Background**
- Extensive use of GEARS motion capture
- Track dots placed on body show precise movement paths
- Center mass (chest dot) path especially revealing
- Tour pros vs. amateurs show clear differences

**Application Here**
- Sean references "gears dots on the old suit"
- Visualization of chest dot curving back vs. drifting out
- Connects feel to measurable data
- Helps serious students understand biomechanics

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Tour pros move their trail shoulder up and back MORE than lead shoulder goes down and forward** - this ratio is far more asymmetrical than most golfers realize or execute

2. **Control your upper body to control your lower body** - you have better awareness of shoulder movements than pelvic movements, so use that advantage

3. **Film yourself with a vertical reference line from your lead shoulder** - this is the diagnostic that determines if you need this fix

4. **The "fence feel" creates proper arc** - imagining turning behind a fence prevents the drift/drift pattern and keeps mass behind the ball

5. **Don't fix what isn't broken** - if you already have mass behind the line at top, this instruction doesn't apply to you

6. **Proper shoulder arc eliminates early extension and early thrust** - one fix solves multiple problems by addressing root cause

7. **Measurable improvements happen quickly** - Sean changed hip depth by 3 degrees in a single swing by changing focus

8. **This is an evolution of AMG's teaching** - based on how students misapplied previous hip-focused instruction, shifted to more reliable shoulder-focused method

---

## Practice Priority

**High Priority For:**
- Golfers with early extension issues
- Those who have tried hip depth drills without success
- Players with too much forward mass at top (per video analysis)
- Anyone who "pops" trail hip back incorrectly

**Medium Priority For:**
- General population wanting more efficient pivot
- Golfers working on improved sequencing
- Players with inconsistent low point control

**Low Priority For:**
- Golfers who already have mass behind line at top
- Those with reverse spine angle (opposite problem)
- Players with other more fundamental issues

**Diagnostic Required:**
Film from down-the-line first - only work on this if assessment shows you need it.
