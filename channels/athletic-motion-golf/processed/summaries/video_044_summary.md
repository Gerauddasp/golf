## Overview

This video debunks one of golf's most persistent myths: that you must "maintain your posture" throughout the swing. Using 3D motion capture data from elite players, AMG demonstrates that the opposite is true - losing posture (specifically, extending the body through impact) is not only necessary but directly correlated with better rotation and clubhead speed. The instructors clarify the critical difference between proper body extension and the undesirable "early thrusting" or "humping" that golfers try to avoid. Through detailed biomechanical analysis, they show that elite players extend from their bent-over address position back toward standing posture at impact while maintaining side bend and tilt - creating what appears as a "flat back" from the 45-degree camera angle.

## Key Concepts

### The Posture Loss Myth

**The Common Misconception:**
- Golfers are taught to "keep your butt against the wall" throughout the swing
- Instagram/YouTube constantly shows tips to "get your chest down to the ground through impact"
- This creates a contorted, overly bent position that restricts rotation and speed
- This advice is often given as a solution to "early extension"

**The Data-Driven Reality:**
- Elite players LOSE posture significantly from address to impact
- This is NOT the same as "early extension" or forward thrusting toward the ball
- The body extends upward (back toward standing posture), not forward (toward the target line)
- Keeping excessive forward bend physically restricts rotation and clubhead speed

### The Biomechanics of Proper Extension

**3D Analysis - Major Champion with 7-Iron:**

**Standing Posture (Baseline):**
- Pelvis: 1.5° posterior tilt (slightly angled upward past horizontal)
- Chest center: 4° behind pelvis center
- This is the reference position - aligned and neutral

**Address Position:**
- Pelvis: 16° anterior tilt (tilted forward)
- Chest: 13° forward of pelvis
- Normal bent-over golf posture

**Delivery Phase (Shaft Parallel in Downswing):**
- Pelvis: Extended to just 1° anterior tilt (nearly back to standing posture)
- Chest: Only 2° less forward bent than address
- Pelvis has already extended 15° while chest maintains its bend

**Impact:**
- Pelvis: 5° posterior tilt (extended 21° total from address)
- Chest: 6° forward of pelvis (lost more than half its forward bend from address)
- Left side of pelvis still back through the "butt line" (NOT thrust forward)

**Key Finding:** "There is a direct correlation in the data between posture loss and rotation. The players who lose the most turn the most, and the players who keep the most posture turn the least."

### Club Length Effect

**Driver vs. 7-Iron:**
- Loss of posture becomes MORE pronounced with longer clubs
- Driver requires even more extension than mid-irons
- This accommodates the wider swing arc and greater rotational speed

### The "Flat Back" Visual Checkpoint

**45-Degree Camera Angle Discovery:**
- When viewing elite players from a 45-degree angle behind at impact
- The entire backside from mid-back through the glutes appears flat (not arched, not curved)
- This flat appearance results from:
  - Body extending upward (pelvis and chest aligning vertically)
  - Maintaining side bend/tilt to the right
  - Head staying down with neck flexion

**NOT This:** Excessive arching/hyperextension of the spine

**YES This:** Flat plane from back to butt while maintaining side bend

### The Three-Dimensional Movement

**Critical Understanding:**
- Extension occurs in the sagittal plane (front-to-back bending)
- Side bend occurs in the frontal plane (lateral tilt)
- Rotation occurs in the transverse plane (turning)
- All three must happen simultaneously and correctly

**Common Error:**
- Focusing on one plane (flat back extension) while losing another (side bend)
- Creates head rise when side bend is lost
- Must maintain "airplane wing tilt" even while extending the back

### Connection to Club Path and Release

**Biomechanical Benefits of Proper Extension:**
- Allows hands to stay on trail side at impact (recent AMG emphasis)
- Enables efficient ground force production through lead leg
- Creates space for proper club release
- Club and hands "curve around" together in the same direction
- Prevents the common pattern of hands and club working in opposite directions

**Speed Generation:**
- Pushing efficiently against the ground with the lead side requires body extension
- The "curving the handle around" motion maximizes ground force utilization
- More natural on the body than fighting to stay bent over
- Generates more clubhead speed with less effort

## Actionable Drills

### Drill 1: Standing Posture to Impact Extension

**Purpose:** Feel the difference between standing alignment and proper impact position

**Setup:**
1. Stand in normal upright posture
2. Note that chest center is directly over pelvis center
3. This is your neutral alignment baseline

**Execution:**
1. From standing, tilt forward into address posture (bent over)
2. Note the forward bend of your chest relative to your pelvis
3. From address position, extend your body back toward standing
4. STOP when you return to vertical alignment (chest over pelvis)
5. This is the extension you need at impact - NOT hyperextension beyond this point

**Key Feel:**
- You're extending FROM bent-over address position
- You're extending TO standing alignment, not BEYOND it
- This should feel like "getting back to neutral," not "thrusting forward"

**Success Markers:**
- Chest and pelvis vertically aligned
- No forward thrust of pelvis toward target
- Natural and easier to rotate from this position

### Drill 2: 45-Degree Flat Back Check (Requires Helper)

**Purpose:** Visual verification of proper extension pattern using the flat back checkpoint

**Setup:**
1. Have a helper position themselves at 45 degrees behind you (between down-the-line and face-on)
2. Helper holds phone/camera at hip height
3. Set up in address position

**Execution:**
1. Make slow-motion swings (50% speed)
2. Helper records video or takes burst photos through impact
3. Freeze at impact position or review video
4. Check if backside from mid-back to glutes appears flat (not curved inward, not arched outward)

**Success Markers:**
- Flat plane visible from 45-degree angle
- Butt line hasn't moved forward (still back)
- Head is down (maintained side bend)
- Natural-looking athletic position, not contorted

**Common Errors to Identify:**
- Excessive curve in lower back = staying too bent over
- Arched/hyperextended look = overdoing the extension
- Head way up = lost side bend while extending

### Drill 3: Swing Coach App Head Tracking with Extension Focus

**Purpose:** Train proper extension while maintaining side bend using real-time feedback

**Equipment Needed:**
- Swing Coach app (iPhone - Android coming soon) OR smartphone with video app and line drawing capability
- Practice balls (foam balls recommended initially)

**Setup:**
1. Position camera down-the-line at hip height
2. In Swing Coach app, activate head position tracking
3. Draw reference line at address head position
4. Set tolerance zone (3-4 inches acceptable movement)

**Execution - Phase 1 (Extension Focus):**
1. Make swing focusing ONLY on extending back to create flat back
2. Check app feedback for head position
3. First attempts may show head rising significantly (6+ inches)
4. This indicates proper extension but loss of side bend

**Execution - Phase 2 (Adding Side Bend):**
1. Maintain the flat back extension feel
2. Add conscious side bend to the right (for right-handed players)
3. Think "airplane wing tilt" while extending
4. Goal: Keep head in the zone (within 3-4 inches of address position)

**Execution - Phase 3 (Integration):**
1. Continue swinging with both feels
2. Monitor app for consistent head position
3. Start with foam balls to avoid bailing on the feel due to mishits
4. Gradually increase speed as pattern becomes consistent
5. Progress to real balls only when head stays in zone consistently

**Key Insight:** "You can't rely on your feels when you're doing this because your feels are going to be all over the place. This trains your feels. You have to earn your feels."

**Success Markers:**
- Head stays within 3-4 inches of address position at impact
- Flat back visible from down-the-line
- Improved ball striking as body positions improve
- Feels become more natural and repeatable with practice

**Common Mistakes:**
- Getting flat back correct but head rises = missing side bend
- Bailing on the feel after a mishit = need more reps with foam balls
- Focusing on ball flight too soon = need more position-focused reps

### Drill 4: Old School Video Feedback (No App Required)

**Purpose:** Train proper extension using basic video analysis

**Equipment Needed:**
- Smartphone camera
- Tripod or stable camera position
- Video editing app with line drawing (built into most phones)

**Setup:**
1. Position camera down-the-line at hip height
2. Frame so entire swing is visible
3. Mark a spot to ensure consistent camera position

**Execution:**
1. Record 5-10 swings
2. Review video and draw vertical line at address head position
3. Draw line showing back angle at impact (should be flat, not curved)
4. Analyze pattern:
   - Head position at impact vs. address
   - Back flatness from down-the-line view
   - Hip position (should not thrust forward)
5. Make adjustments based on visual feedback
6. Record another set and compare

**Success Markers:**
- Head stays relatively stable (small rise acceptable with proper side bend)
- Back appears flat from mid-back to glutes at impact
- Progressive improvement over practice sessions

## Key Takeaways

1. **Elite players LOSE posture from address to impact** - The body extends from bent-over address position back toward standing posture, particularly from delivery (last parallel) through impact.

2. **Data proves correlation: More posture loss = More rotation** - 3D analysis shows a direct relationship between the degree of posture loss and rotational speed. Players who maintain too much forward bend rotate the slowest.

3. **Extension is NOT the same as early extension/thrusting** - Proper extension moves the body upward (back to standing), not forward (toward the ball). The pelvis can extend significantly while the left hip stays back behind the "butt line."

4. **Specific numbers from elite players (7-iron)** - Pelvis extends 21° from address to impact (16° anterior tilt to 5° posterior tilt). Chest loses more than half its forward bend (from 13° forward of pelvis to 6° forward).

5. **The 45-degree flat back checkpoint** - From a 45-degree camera angle, elite players show a flat plane from mid-back through glutes at impact, not a curved spine.

6. **Three-dimensional movement required** - Must extend the back (sagittal plane) while maintaining side bend (frontal plane) and rotation (transverse plane) simultaneously. Missing any plane creates problems.

7. **Longer clubs require more extension** - Driver swings show even more pronounced posture loss than mid-iron swings to accommodate the wider arc and greater speed.

8. **Extension enables proper release mechanics** - Allows hands to stay on trail side at impact, creates efficient ground force production, and promotes club and hands moving together rather than in opposite directions.

9. **Video feedback is essential** - "Your feels are going to be all over the place" when learning this. Use app-based or manual video analysis to train proper positions until feels become accurate.

10. **Don't bail on bad shots during training** - Use foam balls initially. Your release pattern must adapt to your body being in a different position. Expect mishits during the learning process.

## Training Progression

**Week 1-2: Position Awareness**
- Focus on Drill 1 (Standing to Impact) to understand the feel
- Use Drill 2 (45-Degree Check) to verify positions
- Goal: Understand what proper extension feels like vs. staying bent over

**Week 3-4: Video Feedback Integration**
- Implement Drill 3 (Swing Coach App) or Drill 4 (Manual Video)
- Start with foam balls, 50% speed
- Goal: Consistently achieve flat back with head stability

**Week 5-6: Speed and Ball Striking**
- Increase to 75% speed with foam balls
- Begin incorporating real balls as positions stabilize
- Goal: Maintain positions at higher speeds with improved contact

**Week 7-8: Full Integration**
- Progress to full speed with real balls
- Reduce feedback frequency (every 5-10 swings instead of every swing)
- Goal: Ingrained feel with consistent ball striking

## Practice Tips

1. **Start with foam balls** - Removes anxiety about ball flight and prevents bailing on correct positions due to mishits
2. **Focus on one plane at a time initially** - Get flat back first, then add side bend, rather than trying both simultaneously
3. **Use consistent camera angles** - Down-the-line and 45-degree views are most useful for this specific pattern
4. **Accept that release timing must adapt** - Your club delivery will feel different when your body is in a different position at impact
5. **Practice without immediate ball flight judgment** - Position quality is the priority; ball flight will improve as positions improve

## Equipment Recommendations

- **Swing Coach App** (AMG's proprietary app) - Provides real-time head tracking and position analysis
- **Smartphone tripod** - For consistent camera positioning during self-analysis
- **Foam practice balls** - Essential for learning phase to prevent feel contamination from mishits
- **Full-length mirror** (optional) - Can help with initial feel of flat back position without camera setup
