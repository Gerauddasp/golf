## Overview

This video addresses a critical misunderstanding in modern golf instruction: adding rotation without the proper compensations. AMG instructors Mike and Sean explain why a student's handicap increased after focusing on "more rotation" and identify three prerequisite conditions that must exist before rotation can benefit your swing. The lesson features live Swing Coach app demonstrations showing the quantifiable difference between proper and improper sequencing. This is essential viewing for anyone who has heard "you need more rotation" but hasn't seen improvement.

## The Core Problem: Rotation Without Prerequisites

### The Case Study
A golf school attendee spent months adding rotation to his swing and saw his handicap **increase** as a result. The issue wasn't rotation itself, but the absence of three critical prerequisites that allow rotation to function properly.

### TPI Principle: "Rotation is a Face Opener"
This fundamental concept explains why adding rotation to a flawed swing amplifies existing problems rather than solving them.

## The Three Prerequisites for Adding Rotation

### 1. Slack in Transition

**The Biomechanics:**
- **Address position**: Shoulders and hips are rotationally aligned (0° differential)
- **Top of backswing**: Approximately 45° hip rotation, 90° shoulder rotation
- **Critical requirement**: Must have additional rotational capacity remaining at the top

**What Slack Means:**
Slack is the rotational buffer between the lead arm and torso that allows opposing movements during transition. At the top of the backswing, you should NOT be at maximum shoulder turn relative to hip turn.

**Proper Sequence with Slack:**
1. Club finishes backswing motion (still moving back)
2. Pelvis begins downswing motion (moving forward)
3. Torso gets pulled by pelvis rotation
4. Lead arm moves closer to chest (final slack consumed)
5. Club slots into proper plane

**Without Slack - The Rubber Band Effect:**
When maxed out rotationally, starting the downswing sequence causes an immediate shoulder spin. "It's like pulling a rubber band to its max and then letting it go - everything snaps." The student literally couldn't talk during his swing because he was maxed out, like holding your breath.

**Result of No Slack:**
- Arms and club shoot straight out (over-the-top)
- No time for club to shallow or slot
- Loss of lag and compression
- Inconsistent contact

**Self-Check:**
Can you continue talking normally during your backswing? If you're holding your breath or feeling maxed out, you lack slack.

### 2. Proper Club Face Position

**Two Critical Checkpoints:**

**Checkpoint 1 - Top of Backswing:**
- Face should be on the TOP SIDE of the shaft
- Face should NOT point to the sky
- Mass of the club head should NOT be behind the shaft
- This is visible from face-on camera view

**Checkpoint 2 - Halfway Down (Checkpoint 6):**
- When club is parallel to ground on downswing
- Face should be roughly vertical (straight up and down)
- NOT pointing to sky (too open/laid back)
- NOT pointing to ground (too closed)

**The Hosel vs. Sweet Spot Problem:**

When the face is too open (pointing to sky) halfway down, you're "lagging the hosel" instead of lagging the sweet spot.

**Brian Manzella's Finger Drill:**
- Partner places finger on sweet spot at top of backswing
- During downswing, feel like you're "hooking" their finger
- Sweet spot should drag/pull toward the ball
- Most amateurs have the finger slide right off (hosel leading)

**Why Open Face + Rotation = Disaster:**
If you rotate with the hosel leading, you have massive compensations to make in the final 2 feet before impact. This caused one student to shank ONLY on AMG's mats (not dirt) because the mats don't allow the club to dig and mask the problem.

**Swing Coach App Analysis:**
The app can show you face position at specific checkpoints. Look for vertical club face (perpendicular to ground) at halfway down position.

### 3. Allowing Arms to Work Down (Not "Leaving Them Up")

**The Flawed Concept:**
A trend years ago promoted "leave your arms up, leave your arms up" during the downswing. While this may have helped someone who threw the club away early, it creates severe problems for most golfers.

**The Hand Path Problem:**

**With Arms Left Up + Body Rotation:**
- Hand path tracks extremely out and over
- Requires extreme side bend to make contact
- Club approaches ball too vertically
- Often leads to over-the-top pattern
- "Crashing" through impact

**Proper Arm/Body Coordination:**
When the body rotates early in the downswing, the arms must sink/drop to maintain proper hand path. These are OPPOSING motions happening simultaneously.

**The Shoulder Lock Drill:**
Instructor grabs student's shoulders at top of backswing and says "get to the ball without using your shoulders." This immediately forces proper arm drop and reveals correct arm motion independent of body rotation.

**Result of Proper Arm Drop:**
- Shallower hand path
- Natural crossover post-impact
- Handle forward at impact
- Body can be open with club still approaching from inside

## The AMG Principle: Opposing Movements

**Key Insight:**
"Almost the entire swing, you're going to have parts of the body doing opposite motions. You don't want everything doing backswing motions and everything doing downswing motions."

During transition:
- Club is finishing backswing
- Pelvis is starting downswing
- Arms are dropping while torso is rotating
- These opposing movements are ESSENTIAL for proper sequencing

## Reframe: Earlier Rotation vs. More Rotation

**Critical Distinction:**
Most golfers benefit from thinking "EARLIER rotation" rather than "MORE rotation."

The goal is to get the hips re-squared as early as possible WHILE maintaining proper hand path. This requires:
1. Built-in slack
2. Face in good position
3. Arms dropping

Without these three prerequisites, attempting earlier/more rotation throws the hands out and creates steeper, more out-to-in hand paths.

## Swing Coach App Training Protocol

**Setup:**
- Monitor: Hand path halfway down
- Goal: Shallow or neutral hand path while rotating body early

**Practice Method - Bracketing:**
1. Hit one intentionally steep (arms up, max rotation)
2. App reads "STEEP - halfway down"
3. Hit one with the correction (slack, arms drop)
4. App reads "SHALLOW - halfway down" or "GOOD SWING"
5. Feel both extremes to find the middle

**Why This Works:**
"Instead of just trying to get it right, try to move past it a little bit." Most golfers need to over-correct just to reach neutral. Bracketing allows you to feel both sides and identify the proper middle ground.

**Mental Freedom:**
The app monitors the metric (hand path) so you can focus on a single feel (adding slack, dropping arms, etc.) rather than trying to think about five things. You get immediate feedback on the downstream effect of your change.

## Implementation Strategy

### Diagnostic Order:
1. **Check for slack**: Record swing from face-on. Do you look maxed out at the top? Can you talk during backswing?
2. **Check face position**: Review video at top of swing and halfway down. Is face on top of shaft at top? Vertical halfway down?
3. **Check hand path**: Does it track out and over, or drop and shallow?

### Correction Priority:
Fix issues in this order:
1. First, build slack (don't max out shoulder turn)
2. Second, get face in better position (more closed at top)
3. Third, allow arms to work down
4. Finally, add earlier rotation

### Training Focus:
Use Swing Coach app or video analysis to monitor hand path while working on prerequisites. You'll know the corrections are working when hand path improves.

## Common Compensations to Avoid

**With Open Face:**
- Excessive hand manipulation through impact
- Trying to "hold off" release
- Aiming left and playing slice

**With No Slack:**
- Feeling rushed, quick tempo
- Inability to create lag
- Everything firing at once

**With Arms Left Up:**
- Excessive side bend
- Early extension
- Loss of posture through impact
- Steep divots or thin/topped shots

## Technology Integration

**Swing Coach App Benefits:**
- Free 2-week trial (iOS, Android coming soon)
- Real-time audio feedback during practice
- Focus on one swing thought while app monitors result
- Can practice multiple parameters simultaneously
- "Best tool we've ever used"

**Video Analysis Alternative:**
- Slow-motion review at specific checkpoints
- Check slack at top
- Check face position at top and halfway down
- Check hand path tracking

## Key Principles Summary

1. **Rotation amplifies existing issues** - It's a face opener and steepener if prerequisites aren't met
2. **Slack enables sequencing** - Without it, everything fires simultaneously
3. **Face position determines what you're lagging** - Hosel vs. sweet spot
4. **Opposing movements are essential** - Some parts doing backswing while others do downswing
5. **Earlier rotation > more rotation** - Think timing, not quantity
6. **Hand path is the outcome metric** - Shows whether prerequisites are being met

## Self-Assessment Questions

1. Do I look/feel maxed out at the top of my backswing?
2. Is my club face pointing to the sky at the top of my swing?
3. Is my club face pointing to the sky halfway down?
4. Does my hand path track outward rather than dropping?
5. Have I been working on "more rotation" without seeing improvement?

If you answered YES to any of these questions, you need to address the prerequisites before adding rotation will help your swing.

## Related Concepts

- **Checkpoint 6**: AMG's swing system designation for club position halfway down
- **Lagging the sweet spot**: Feeling the mass of the club head trailing during downswing
- **Hand path shallowing**: Critical metric for proper downswing sequencing
- **Opposing movements**: Simultaneous backswing and downswing motions in different body parts

## Progressive Practice Plan

**Week 1: Awareness**
- Record swings from face-on and down-the-line
- Identify which of the three issues you have
- Practice the shoulder lock drill to feel proper arm drop

**Week 2: Face Position**
- Check face at top - on top of shaft
- Check face halfway down - vertical
- Use Manzella finger drill to feel sweet spot lag

**Week 3: Building Slack**
- Practice 80% backswing turns
- Feel like you have more turn available at "top"
- Allow pelvis to start before shoulders finish

**Week 4: Integration with App**
- Use Swing Coach app monitoring hand path
- Practice bracketing (steep vs. shallow)
- Focus on one feel while app monitors result
- Add earlier rotation only when hand path stays neutral/shallow

## Bottom Line

Adding rotation to a swing that lacks slack, has an open face, or leaves the arms up is like adding throttle to a car with the wheels turned - you'll go faster in the wrong direction. Fix the prerequisites first, then rotation becomes a powerful addition to your swing rather than a handicap increaser.

The goal is early hip rotation with a shallow hand path and square club face. This combination allows the body to be open at impact while the club approaches from the inside with a square face - the holy grail of consistent ball striking.
