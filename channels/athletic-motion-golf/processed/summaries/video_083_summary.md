## Overview

This short drill video addresses a common tempo problem: getting quick in the transition. Athletic Motion Golf identifies the root cause as being too deliberate at the start of the swing, which forces golfers to rush the late backswing to generate momentum. The solution is a "Quick-Slow-Quick" tempo drill that reverses this pattern by creating speed in the early takeaway, allowing the club to "die" at the top, and creating better sequencing through transition.

## Key Concepts

### The Problem: Quick Transition Under Pressure

**Root Cause Identified:**
- Being too deliberate/slow at the start of the swing
- Having to speed up late in the backswing to generate momentum
- Results in rushing through transition
- Most noticeable on the course under pressure

**Biomechanical Issue:**
- Lack of early momentum requires late acceleration
- Creates poor sequencing from top of swing
- Transition becomes rushed and out of sequence

### The Solution: Quick-Slow-Quick Tempo Pattern

**Concept:**
- Flip the traditional approach on its head
- Create speed early in the takeaway
- Allow the swing to decelerate at the top
- Creates perceived "more time" in transition

**Benefits:**
- Improves sequencing
- Smooths out transition
- Better rhythm and timing
- More consistent ball striking

## Actionable Drills

### Quick-Slow-Quick Tempo Drill

**Purpose**: Develop proper tempo pattern that prevents rushing the transition

**Setup**:
- Standard address position
- Any club (drill works for all clubs)

**Execution**:
1. Take 1-2 practice swings focusing on the tempo pattern
2. **Quick**: Generate speed immediately in the early takeaway
3. **Slow**: Let the club decelerate/die at the top of the backswing
4. **Quick**: Allow natural acceleration through downswing
5. Stand over the ball and replicate the same feel
6. Execute shot with "Quick-Slow-Quick" tempo in mind

**Success Markers**:
- Feeling of "more time" at the top of the swing
- Smoother transition (not rushed)
- Better sequencing through impact
- Improved rhythm and consistency

**Key Feel**:
- Early speed in takeaway (not slow and deliberate)
- Deceleration/pause sensation at the top
- Natural acceleration from transition through impact

## Key Takeaways

1. **Root Cause**: Being too deliberate off the ball forces late backswing speed-up and rushed transition
2. **Solution Pattern**: Quick-Slow-Quick (fast takeaway, slow at top, fast through)
3. **Pressure Management**: This drill specifically helps when pressure causes quick transitions on course
4. **Sequencing Benefit**: Early momentum allows proper deceleration at top, creating better transition sequencing
5. **Practice Method**: Do 1-2 practice swings with exaggerated pattern, then replicate over ball

## AMG Technical Notes

**Tempo Science:**
- Creating early kinetic energy eliminates need for late compensation
- Allowing deceleration at top enables proper kinematic sequence initiation
- Perceived "more time" in transition = better proximal-to-distal sequencing

**Common Application:**
- Used extensively in AMG golf schools
- Particularly effective for golfers who rush under pressure
- Addresses mechanical compensation pattern (late speed-up) caused by poor tempo initiation
