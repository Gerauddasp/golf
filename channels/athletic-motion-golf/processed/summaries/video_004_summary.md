## Overview

This short diagnostic video identifies a critical tempo error that amateur golfers make in their backswing. Athletic Motion Golf contrasts the smooth, continuous tempo of professional golfers (referencing players like Morikawa and Sungjae Im) with the disjointed, hurried tempo of recreational players. The fundamental issue: amateurs think about multiple swing thoughts during the takeaway, then rush through the second half of the backswing, which disrupts transition sequencing and overall tempo.

## Key Concepts

### Professional vs Amateur Backswing Tempo

**Tour Player Pattern:**
- Super smooth off the ball
- Smooth acceleration into the top of the backswing
- Smooth completion
- THEN explosive speed in the downswing

**Amateur Golfer Pattern:**
- Thinking about 4+ different swing thoughts during takeaway
- Once those mental checkpoints are completed, they rush ("hurry up") through the remainder of the backswing
- Creates a disjointed, two-speed backswing motion
- Described as "completely different animal" from tour tempo

### The Speed-Sequence Connection

**Biomechanical Principle:**
- The faster you accelerate in the second half of the backswing, the harder it becomes to make a properly sequenced transition
- Rushing to the top creates timing issues that cascade through the downswing
- Smooth tempo in the backswing enables better kinematic sequencing from transition through impact

### The Mental Overload Problem

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Amateur golfers process 4+ swing thoughts during takeaway
- Mental processing creates pause/slow section in early backswing
- Once thoughts are "checked off," golfer rushes to compensate for perceived slowness
- Creates a herky-jerky rhythm rather than smooth acceleration

## Actionable Drills

### The Two-Count Pause Drill

**Purpose**: Break the habit of rushing the second half of the backswing and develop awareness of proper tempo

**Setup**:
- Normal address position with any club
- No special equipment needed

**Execution**:
1. Make a smooth takeaway
2. When you reach the top of the backswing, consciously count "one, two" before starting the downswing
3. The pause will feel exaggerated (like "half an hour up there")
4. This exaggeration is intentional and necessary to recalibrate your tempo perception

**Success Markers**:
- The forced pause should feel uncomfortably long at first
- Over time, you'll develop better awareness of how you're applying speed in the backswing
- Gradually reduce the pause duration while maintaining smooth acceleration throughout the backswing
- Eventually, you'll achieve continuous smooth tempo without needing the artificial pause

**Training Progression**:
- Week 1-2: Full two-count pause, exaggerate the feeling
- Week 3-4: One-count pause, focus on smooth second half of backswing
- Week 5+: No pause, but maintain the smooth acceleration pattern learned from the drill

## Key Takeaways

1. **Never rush the second half of your backswing** - This is tempo killer #1 and makes proper transition sequencing nearly impossible

2. **Pros are smooth throughout the entire backswing, THEN explosive** - The speed comes in the downswing, not at the top of the backswing

3. **Multiple swing thoughts in the takeaway lead to compensation rushing** - Reduce mental clutter in your backswing

4. **Use the two-count pause drill to recalibrate tempo awareness** - It will feel ridiculously long at first, but that's exactly the point

5. **Tempo affects sequencing** - Smooth backswing tempo is a prerequisite for proper kinematic sequencing through transition

## AMG Scientific Context

This video addresses a common amateur fault pattern that AMG has documented extensively in their 3D motion capture data. The rushed backswing creates what they term "false urgency" - the golfer perceives they need to speed up when they actually need to maintain consistent acceleration. The two-count drill is an exaggeration technique designed to reset proprioceptive awareness and break ingrained compensation patterns.
