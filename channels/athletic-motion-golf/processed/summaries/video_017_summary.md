## Overview

This short but impactful video reveals a simple yet powerful practice technique used by elite golfers: rehearsing the transition position between waist-high backswing and impact. Shawn demonstrates his pre-shot routine of feeling the critical body positions through impact, particularly focusing on the relationship between knee height, hip tilt, and upper body positioning. This micro-rehearsal creates kinesthetic awareness and prevents common faults like hip thrust and loss of club face control.

## Key Concepts

### Pre-Shot Position Rehearsal
- Elite players routinely rehearse the transition-to-impact movement between shots
- Movement goes from waist-high backswing position to impact position
- Creates awareness and "primes" the neuromuscular system for the upcoming shot
- Can be done while waiting on the course or between range balls

### The Critical Position: Knee Height Differential
- **Common Fault**: Bending the trail knee while allowing the trail hip to rise
- **Correct Position**: Trail side (left knee for right-handers) stays LOWER than lead side
- This knee differential is Shawn's personal "kiss of death" checkpoint
- When trail hip rises, club face control deteriorates immediately

### The Kinetic Chain of Tilt
- **Foundation**: Trail knee lower than lead knee
- **Result 1**: Hips tilt in the same direction (trail side lower)
- **Result 2**: Upper body tilts automatically to match hip tilt
- **Key Insight**: "You kind of get the upper body tilt for free" when knees are positioned correctly
- Tilt happens naturally through proper sequencing, not forced positioning

## Actionable Drills

### Position Pause Drill
**Purpose**: Develop awareness of correct body positions through impact
**Setup**: No ball needed initially; can be done anywhere
**Execution**:
1. Take club to waist-high backswing position
2. Pause momentarily at transition
3. Check that trail knee is LOWER than lead knee
4. Feel hip tilt with trail side lower
5. Sense upper body tilt happening automatically
6. Continue slowly to impact position

**Success Markers**:
- Clear sensation of trail side being lower
- No sense of forcing or lifting
- Club face control maintained
- Movement feels natural and gravity-assisted

### Waist-High to Waist-High Drill
**Purpose**: Ingrain correct positions through repetitive motion
**Setup**: On range or in practice area
**Execution**:
1. Start at waist-high backswing position with pause
2. Verify knee differential (trail lower)
3. Move through to waist-high follow-through
4. Repeat motion 3-5 times without ball
5. Progress to hitting chip shots with same abbreviated swing
6. Focus entirely on FEELING the motion, not ball flight

**Success Markers**:
- Consistent knee height relationship
- Smooth transition through impact
- Solid contact on chip shots
- Ability to repeat the feel reliably

### On-Course Awareness Drill
**Purpose**: Maintain feel and awareness during actual play
**Setup**: Between shots while waiting
**Execution**:
1. Take a few practice motions from waist-high to impact
2. Focus on trail side staying lower
3. Feel the natural tilt sequence
4. Perform 2-3 rehearsals before addressing ball
5. Take this awareness directly into your swing

**Success Markers**:
- Reduced swing thoughts
- Better strike quality
- More consistent club face control
- Increased confidence over the ball

## Key Takeaways

1. **Elite players constantly rehearse critical positions** - This isn't random practice; it's targeted neuromuscular programming between shots

2. **Trail knee/hip height is a critical checkpoint** - When the trail side elevates, club face control is lost immediately

3. **Body tilt happens automatically from correct knee positioning** - Don't try to force upper body tilt; establish proper knee relationship and tilt emerges naturally

4. **Pause points create awareness** - Momentarily stopping at the transition position allows you to verify correct positioning before continuing

5. **Quality practice beats ball-beating** - Rehearsing positions and hitting controlled chip shots with proper feel is more valuable than full swings without awareness

6. **Use wait time productively** - Transform downtime on the course into quality practice by rehearsing critical positions

## Technical Details

**Body Segment Relationship (Right-Handed Golfer)**:
- Left knee (trail) → LOWER than right knee (lead)
- Left hip → LOWER than right hip
- Upper body → Tilted with left side lower, automatically

**Common Fault Pattern**:
- Trail knee bends ✓ (correct)
- BUT trail hip rises ✗ (fault)
- Result: Loss of club face control

**Correct Pattern**:
- Trail knee bends AND stays lower ✓
- Trail hip stays lower ✓
- Result: Natural tilt cascade, maintained club face control ✓

## Practice Integration

**Before Range Session**: 10 position rehearsals without club
**During Range Session**: Alternate full swings with waist-high abbreviated swings
**On Course**: 2-3 position rehearsals while waiting between shots
**At Home**: Mirror work checking knee and hip relationship at transition

## Related Concepts

- Body segment sequencing in the downswing
- Ground reaction forces and vertical movement
- Club face control through impact
- Kinesthetic awareness development
- Pre-shot routine optimization

*Note: This video demonstrates the power of micro-practice - rehearsing small segments of the swing with focused awareness. The principle can be applied to any movement pattern, but the transition position is particularly valuable because it sets up the entire delivery sequence.*
