## Overview

This short instructional video presents a simple yet highly effective drill for improving fairway wood contact. The drill focuses on developing the correct low-point control and angle of attack necessary for solid fairway wood strikes. Using only a tee placed flush on a practice mat, golfers can train the shallow, sweeping arc required to consistently compress fairway woods off the deck. The drill provides immediate feedback on swing path and attack angle through the simple success metric of clipping the tee without breaking it or hitting the ground.

## Key Concepts

### Low Point Control and Attack Angle
- Fairway woods require a specific low point and angle of descent to achieve optimal contact
- The club must bottom out at the correct location with a shallow approach
- Too steep of an attack angle will result in digging and poor contact
- Too shallow or ascending will result in thin or topped shots
- The drill trains the precise arc width and approach angle needed for fairway wood success

### The "Widish Arc" Requirement
- Fairway woods demand a wider, shallower swing arc compared to irons
- The arc must "line up for impact" at the ball's location
- A steep, narrow arc (as with irons) will break the tee by hitting down too aggressively
- An excessively shallow or upward arc won't make contact with the tee at all
- The optimal arc just barely brushes the grass at the bottom of the swing

### Practice Surface Optimization
- A practice mat provides an ideal surface for this drill because the tee sits flush
- The mat simulates a tight lie condition common with fairway woods
- Home practice mats are perfect for developing this skill
- The firm surface provides clear feedback on strike quality

## Actionable Drills

### Tee Clipping Drill (Fairway Wood Low Point Control)

**Purpose**: Develop the correct low point, attack angle, and arc width for consistent fairway wood contact

**Equipment Needed**:
- One golf tee
- Practice mat (preferred) or tight lie area
- Fairway wood

**Setup**:
1. Place a tee flush on a practice mat so it sits level with the surface
2. Position as if the tee were the ball location
3. Take your normal fairway wood address position

**Execution**:
1. Make practice swings attempting to "just barely brush the grass" at the tee location
2. The goal is to clip the tee cleanly without:
   - Breaking or snapping the tee (indicates too steep/downward)
   - Missing the tee entirely (indicates too shallow/upward)
   - Banging into the ground (indicates poor low point control)
3. Focus on creating a "widish arc" that naturally lines up with the tee at impact
4. Start with slow-motion swings to groove the proper feel
5. Gradually increase swing speed while maintaining the same shallow arc

**Success Markers**:
- Tee is clipped/moved but remains intact (not broken)
- No divot or mat contact before the tee
- Sound of club brushing through the tee location cleanly
- Consistent ability to repeat the action on multiple attempts
- Sensation of a wider, shallower arc compared to iron swings

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
- Attempting to "dig down" on the ball as with irons (will break tee)
- Trying to lift or scoop the ball up (will miss tee entirely)
- Too narrow/steep of a swing arc
- Inconsistent low point from swing to swing

**Progression**:
1. Begin with slow-motion rehearsal swings (no tee)
2. Add the tee and practice at 50% speed
3. Increase to 75% speed while maintaining success
4. Progress to full-speed swings
5. Finally, place a ball on the tee and replicate the same motion

## Key Takeaways

1. **Low point control is critical for fairway woods** - The club must bottom out at precisely the right location with a shallow angle of attack

2. **The tee clipping drill provides instant feedback** - Success (tee clipped cleanly) vs. failure (tee broken or missed) is immediately apparent

3. **Fairway woods require a "widish arc"** - A shallower, wider swing path is essential compared to the steeper iron swing

4. **Practice mats are ideal for this drill** - The tee sits flush, simulating tight lie conditions and providing clear feedback

5. **Start slow and build speed** - Master the motion at slower speeds before progressing to full swings

6. **The feel is "barely brushing the grass"** - This sensation indicates the correct shallow approach angle

7. **Home practice is highly effective** - This drill can be done anywhere with a mat, making it perfect for frequent repetition

## Biomechanical Insights

**Attack Angle Optimization**: Fairway woods perform best with a neutral to slightly descending attack angle (0° to -3°), which this drill naturally promotes by requiring the tee to be clipped without breaking.

**Arc Width vs. Swing Radius**: The "widish arc" referred to in the video relates to maintaining swing radius through the impact zone rather than releasing early or pulling up, which would narrow the effective arc width.

**Low Point Consistency**: This drill trains proprioceptive awareness of where the club bottoms out, a skill that transfers directly to on-course fairway wood contact from various lies.

## Practice Integration

**Warm-Up Application**: Use 5-10 slow-motion tee clips before practicing with balls to establish proper feel

**Between-Ball Reset**: After a poor contact with the ball, return to tee-only swings to recalibrate the proper arc

**Home Practice Routine**: Perform 20-30 tee clips daily on a home mat to engrain the correct motion pattern

**On-Course Visualization**: Before fairway wood shots, visualize the tee clipping sensation to prime the correct shallow arc
