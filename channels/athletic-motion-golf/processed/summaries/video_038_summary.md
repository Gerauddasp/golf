## Overview

This short video provides a cautionary tale about a popular but harmful practice drill - the "T-in-pocket" drill. An AMG instructor shares his personal negative experience with this drill, explaining how it created severe swing faults that took years to correct. The drill involves trying to keep the hands close to the body (rubbing a tee in the pocket) during the takeaway while the club stays out, which creates biomechanical problems throughout the swing sequence.

## Key Concepts

### The Harmful "T-in-Pocket" Drill

**What It Is:**
- Placing a tee in your front pocket
- Attempting to "rub" the tee with your hands during takeaway
- Hands move inward toward the body while the club stays extended outward
- Creates disconnection between body rotation and arm movement

**Why It's Problematic:**
- Forces an unnatural shoulder movement pattern
- Pulls the hands excessively inside
- Club stays outside while hands move in (disconnection)

### Biomechanical Consequences

**Backswing Issues:**
- **Hoisting Pattern**: Shoulders lift and tilt incorrectly rather than rotating
- **Compensatory Flip**: At some point in the backswing, the club must flip back behind the player to complete the motion
- **Long and Laid-Off Top Position**: Club crosses the line and points well left of target at the top

**Transition and Downswing Problems:**
- **Standing Up**: In transition, the improper backswing forces the player to stand up (early extension)
- **Shaft Steepening**: The club "tips out" and becomes too steep as it approaches impact
- **Path Issues**: Hands drop but club stays outside, creating over-the-top path

### Shot Patterns Created

**Primary Miss:**
- **Left Ball Flight**: Severe pull or pull-hook
- Results from the steep, outside-in path created by the faulty mechanics

**Alternative Compensation:**
- **Hanging On**: Players who recognize the left miss tendency hold the face open
- **Pop Out**: This leads to pushing out of posture and creating blocks/pushes to the right
- Both compensations feel uncomfortable and lead to inconsistency

## Warning Signs You're Affected

### Visual Checkpoints

1. **Address Position**: Excessive focus on keeping hands "connected" to body
2. **Takeaway**: Hands moving dramatically toward body while club extends away
3. **Mid-Backswing**: Shoulders tilting rather than rotating on proper plane
4. **Top of Swing**: Club crossing the line, pointing left, with excessive length
5. **Transition**: Noticeable standing up or loss of posture
6. **Downswing**: Steep shaft angle, hands trapped inside

### Feel Indicators

- Sensation of "hoisting" or lifting in backswing
- Feeling like the club must flip or re-route at top
- Awareness of standing up in downswing
- Constant battle between pull-hooks and blocked shots

## Biomechanical Explanation

### Why This Drill Fails

**Natural Swing Mechanics:**
- Arms and body should work in coordination
- Club moves away from body as body rotates
- Natural width and arc are maintained throughout
- Shoulders rotate on an inclined plane (not vertical lift)

**What This Drill Creates:**
- Artificial separation between arm movement and body rotation
- Forces shoulders into vertical tilt pattern instead of rotation
- Disrupts the natural sequencing of the swing
- Requires multiple compensations to deliver club to ball

**Long-Term Damage:**
- Takes "years" to undo according to instructor testimony
- Creates ingrained movement patterns that are difficult to reprogram
- Leads to chronic inconsistency and frustration
- Can cause physical strain from compensatory movements

## Scientific Perspective

### Kinematic Chain Disruption

The drill breaks the proper kinematic sequence:
- **Normal Sequence**: Ground → Pelvis → Thorax → Arms → Club
- **Drill Creates**: Isolated arm movement → Compensatory shoulder tilt → Forced club reroute → Multiple compensations

### 3D Analysis Would Show

- Excessive shoulder tilt in backswing (reduced shoulder rotation)
- Abnormal club path deviations
- Loss of swing plane consistency
- Early extension patterns in transition
- Steep angle of attack at impact

## Alternatives (Implied)

While the video focuses on what NOT to do, the implication is clear:

### Better Approach

- Allow natural width in takeaway
- Coordinate arm swing with body rotation
- Maintain consistent swing plane
- Avoid artificial "connection" drills that force unnatural positions
- Let the arms extend naturally as the body rotates

## Key Takeaways

1. **The "T-in-pocket" drill creates more problems than it solves** - forcing hands inward while club stays out disrupts natural mechanics
2. **Creates a "hoisting" backswing pattern** - shoulders lift vertically instead of rotating on proper plane
3. **Leads to laid-off, crossed position at top** - club points left of target with excessive length
4. **Forces standing up in transition** - early extension becomes necessary compensation
5. **Results in severe left misses** - steep, outside-in path creates pulls and hooks
6. **Alternative compensation is equally bad** - hanging on to avoid left miss creates blocks and loss of posture
7. **Takes years to fix** - instructor's personal testimony emphasizes how ingrained these patterns become
8. **Avoid artificial "connection" drills** - natural coordination between arms and body is better than forced positions

## Practical Application

### If You've Been Using This Drill

**Immediate Action:**
1. Stop the drill immediately
2. Film your swing to identify current issues
3. Look for signs of hoisting, laid-off positions, and early extension
4. Seek instruction for proper movement patterns

**Rebuilding Process:**
1. Re-establish natural takeaway with coordinated body and arm movement
2. Focus on shoulder rotation (not tilting)
3. Maintain natural width throughout backswing
4. Allow club to stay on plane without forced manipulations
5. Be patient - fixing years of compensations takes time

### Prevention

- Be skeptical of drills that feel unnatural
- Understand the biomechanical reasoning behind any drill
- Film yourself regularly to catch problems early
- Focus on natural, athletic movements
- When in doubt, seek expert analysis before adopting popular drills

## Instructor Credibility Note

The power of this message comes from personal experience - the AMG instructor suffered through this drill's consequences for "more years than I care to imagine." This firsthand testimony adds weight to the warning and demonstrates AMG's commitment to evidence-based instruction over popular but ineffective methods.

**Critical Warning**: This video serves as an important reminder that not all popular drills are beneficial. The "T-in-pocket" drill, despite being widely taught, creates serious biomechanical problems that can take years to correct. Always question the biomechanical logic of any drill before incorporating it into your practice routine.
