## Overview

This video debunks one of golf's most pervasive myths: the need to "create space" in the downswing. Using 3D motion analysis and multiple camera angles, AMG demonstrates that hands at impact are actually on the trail side of the body, not the front leg. The illusion of hands moving across the body is created by hip rotation—the stationary camera perspective creates a visual deception. The key revelation: arms move toward the midline while staying on the trail side, while body rotation creates the appearance of hands moving left.

## The Central Myth Exposed

### The "Create Space" Misconception
- **The Myth**: Golfers must actively wipe hands across body to create space through impact
- **The Reality**: Arms stay beside the body on trail side; rotation creates the visual illusion
- **Why It Matters**: This misunderstanding causes golfers to manipulate arm path incorrectly
- **3D Evidence**: AMG 3D motion capture shows exact arm path independent of body rotation

### The Visual Illusion Explained
- **Camera Position Creates Deception**: Static camera doesn't move with rotating body
- **Impact Position Reality**: Hips 45° open (belt buckle over big toe), hands still trail-side
- **Key Demo**: When hips square back up to camera, hands clearly remain on trail side
- **Mind-Blowing Fact**: Hands are farther back on body at impact than at address

## Hand Position Through Impact Zone

### From Lead Arm Parallel to Impact

**At Lead Arm Parallel (Shallow Position)**:
- Hips square
- Trail elbow reconnected to rib cage (tricep touching side)
- Trail upper arm aligned with body line (approximately 45° to spine)
- Hands on trail side of body

**Critical Checkpoint - Trail Elbow Position**:
- Upper arm on same angle as body line, NOT in front
- Elbow NOT working toward navel
- Too far back = club pitches too vertical
- Too far forward = hands get out over ball (no good player does this)
- Sweet spot = natural reconnection that allows proper club pitch

**From Delivery to Impact**:
- Arms DO NOT cross midline
- Hands move toward midline but stay trail-side
- Trail elbow always behind trail hip (measured by external markers)
- Body rotation brings hands to "front leg appearance" without lateral arm movement

### The Release Path Revealed

**Arm Movement When Body Is Frozen**:
1. From lead arm parallel, arm would:
   - Uncock and lower
   - Unfold elbow
   - Move OUT toward ball at approximately 45° angle

**Key Data Point**: From shaft parallel to shaft parallel, average movement is **8 inches out and around** toward golf ball

**The Release Motion**:
- Elbow moves OUT closer to ball and slightly down
- Hands work forward toward midline (not across it)
- Adding pivot creates "shake hands with target" release position naturally
- Adduction motion (arms across chest) happens LATER, post-impact

**Critical Distinction**:
- Hands work "in front" meaning toward midline/ball
- Hands DO NOT work "in front toward target"
- Crossing midline happens high in follow-through, not through impact

## Biomechanical Breakdown

### Impact Position Architecture

**Hip Position**: 45° open
- **Easy Reference**: Belt buckle over big toe
- This rotation creates the illusion of forward hand position

**Shoulder Line**: Fairly square to slightly open
- Rib cage open due to side bend
- Side bend keeps shoulder line relatively square
- Creates appearance of hands forward from face-on view

**Hand Position Relative to Body**:
- Shaft in front of ball (from face-on camera)
- Hands appear on front leg due to body dimensions and rotation
- When hips square to camera, hands clearly on trail side
- Handle higher at impact than address (more uncocked)

### The 3D Advantage

**Why 3D Motion Capture Changes Everything**:
- Can isolate individual body segments
- Can "turn off" rotation to see pure arm movement
- Tracks every millimeter of every joint
- Reveals truth hidden by static camera angles

**Breaking Out Movements**:
- Body rotation can be frozen to show arm path alone
- Demonstrates arm moves independently of "wiping" motion
- Makes complex motion easier to understand and train
- "It's a light bulb moment"

## Training Implications

### Why Most Golfers Struggle

**The Positional Fishing Problem**:
- Seeing pro in release position = trying to PUT club there manually
- Don't realize position achieved through specific arm motion + rotation
- Result: Manipulated path that looks right but feels wrong
- "Arms going like this" (wiping) when they should be going "like this" (out/down)

**Impact on Learning**:
- Video/stop-motion has hurt more than helped
- All bad swing concepts come from misinterpreting video positions
- Trying to copy positions without understanding motion sequence
- Creates compensation patterns that last entire golf career

### The Tennis Analogy

**Easy Motion vs. Difficult Motion**:
- **Top-spin forehand**: Natural arm motion (like proper golf release)
- **Low slice over net**: Unnatural manipulation (like wiping motion)

**Why "Every Golf School" Has Slicers**:
- Visual deception makes wiping motion look correct
- Feels intuitive based on what camera shows
- Actually fighting natural release mechanics
- Much harder to execute than proper motion

### The Hank Haney Circle Drill

**Purpose**: Train proper arm motion away from wiping
**Execution**:
- Make circles on trail side with club
- Maintains trail-side arm position
- Eliminates across-body manipulation
- Fixes slice by restoring natural release

**Why It Works**:
- Trains arm to move out/around, not left
- Allows face to rotate naturally
- Removes conscious manipulation
- Reestablishes instinctive motion pattern

## Actionable Drills

### Drill 1: Body Square Arm Motion Isolation

**Purpose**: Feel arm movement independent of rotation
**Setup**: Address position, body stays square throughout
**Execution**:
1. Take club to lead arm parallel position
2. Keep body completely square (no rotation)
3. Let arms uncock, unfold, and move out toward ball at 45°
4. Feel the circular motion on trail side
5. Notice how different this feels from wiping across body

**Success Markers**:
- Arms never cross midline while body is square
- Club moves out toward ball, not left toward target line
- Elbow moves closer to ball
- Natural uncocking sensation without manipulation

### Drill 2: Impact Position with Hip Reset

**Purpose**: Prove hands stay trail-side at impact
**Setup**: Get into tour-quality impact position
**Execution**:
1. Rotate hips to 45° open (belt buckle over big toe)
2. Side bend to open rib cage while keeping shoulders square
3. Place arms in impact position (appears over front leg)
4. WITHOUT moving upper body or arms, square hips back
5. Observe hands now clearly on trail side

**Key Insight**: The arm position never changed—only hip rotation changed

### Drill 3: 45-Degree Camera Angle Awareness

**Purpose**: Understand how rotation hides hand position
**Setup**: Set up at 45° to camera (impact hip position)
**Execution**:
1. Get to lead arm parallel, hips square
2. Rotate to impact position (hips 45° open)
3. Camera now sees "squared up" view (as at address)
4. Drop arms to impact position
5. Recognize hands appear forward but are actually trail-side relative to body

**Success Markers**:
- Can visualize how camera angle deceives
- Understand rotation creates appearance, not arm movement
- Feel confident keeping arms trail-side through impact

### Drill 4: Midline Touch Test

**Purpose**: Learn to stop arms at midline, not cross it
**Setup**: Address position, body stays square
**Execution**:
1. Start with hands on trail side
2. Move to delivery position (hips still square)
3. Let hands work forward but DON'T let them cross body centerline
4. Touch grip at midline position
5. Feel that hands stay there while body rotates through

**Success Markers**:
- Arms stay on trail side even in delivery
- Clear feeling of NOT wiping across body
- Hands go TO midline, not PAST it during delivery phase

### Drill 5: Elbow Track Monitoring

**Purpose**: Keep trail elbow behind trail hip through impact
**Setup**: Address position
**Execution**:
1. Place marker/awareness on outside of trail elbow
2. Place marker/awareness on outside of trail hip
3. Swing in slow motion from top
4. Monitor that elbow marker stays behind hip marker entire way to impact
5. Reconnect elbow to rib cage at lead arm parallel

**Success Markers**:
- Elbow never gets in front of hip
- Tricep maintains contact with rib cage
- No sensation of elbow working toward navel
- Natural club pitch maintained

## Key Biomechanical Principles

### Principle 1: The Turning Motion Skews Everything
- Static camera creates false perception of arm path
- Body rotation is what moves hands left, not arm action
- Must separate rotation from arm motion to understand swing
- "The swing is an illusion"

### Principle 2: Arms Beside Body, Not Across It
- You do NOT create space by moving arms away from body
- Arms stay connected to turning body structure
- Rotation provides clearance automatically
- Fighting this creates compensations

### Principle 3: Hand Path Components Are Additive
- Arm motion component: out/down toward ball
- Rotation component: around to left
- Combined result: proper release path
- Trying to create result without components = manipulation

### Principle 4: The Release Goes OUT Before It Goes Left
- From delivery position, arm must move toward ball first
- Elbow extends and uncocks while moving out approximately 45°
- Then rotation brings everything around
- Crossing midline happens high in finish, not at impact

### Principle 5: Position Is Result, Not Goal
- Seeing release position in photo ≠ knowing how to achieve it
- Must understand motion sequence that creates position
- "Fishing for positions" leads to manipulation
- Trust the motion, position arrives naturally

## Common Errors to Avoid

### Error 1: The Wiping Motion
**What It Looks Like**: Actively pulling hands across body toward target
**Why It Happens**: Misinterpreting static camera images of impact
**The Fix**: Keep hands moving toward midline while body rotates
**Result of Error**: Slice, weak contact, inconsistent strike

### Error 2: Trail Elbow Too Far Forward
**What It Looks Like**: Elbow working toward navel in downswing
**Why It Happens**: Trying to "get hands in front"
**The Fix**: Let elbow reconnect to rib cage, upper arm matches body angle
**Result of Error**: Hands too far out over ball, steep angle of attack

### Error 3: Trying to Cross Midline Early
**What It Looks Like**: Hands moving past body centerline before impact
**Why It Happens**: Misunderstanding release path from video analysis
**The Fix**: Hands stay trail-side until well past impact
**Result of Error**: Pull shots, inconsistent path, timing issues

### Error 4: Creating Space Manually
**What It Looks Like**: Pushing arms away from body to "make room"
**Why It Happens**: Belief that space must be actively created
**The Fix**: Arms stay beside body, rotation creates clearance naturally
**Result of Error**: Loss of connection, inconsistent contact, power leak

### Error 5: Copying Positions Without Motion Understanding
**What It Looks Like**: Attempting to match photos of pros at impact
**Why It Happens**: Stop-motion analysis without understanding sequence
**The Fix**: Learn the motion that creates position, not position itself
**Result of Error**: Compensations, inconsistency, plateau in improvement

## Scientific Insights from 3D Analysis

## Mental Models for Success

### Model 1: The Camera Lie
Think of the golf swing filmed from standard DTL view as an optical illusion. The camera creates a 2D representation of a 3D rotational motion. What appears to move left is actually staying right while the platform rotates. Trust the biomechanics, not the visual.

### Model 2: The Tennis Forehand
Compare the feeling of hitting a top-spin forehand (natural, easy) vs. a low slice (manipulated, difficult). Your golf release should feel like the forehand—natural rotation of arm and body, not forced manipulation.

### Model 3: The Carousel
Imagine standing on a rotating platform (your rotating pelvis/torso). Your arms can move relative to your body (out toward ball), but the platform rotation is what moves you around the circle. You don't need to walk around the circle—the platform does that for you.

### Model 4: The Centerline Law
Visualize a plane dividing your body into trail side and lead side. In the downswing and through impact, your hands obey this law: they can approach the centerline but not cross it until well after impact. Body rotation makes them appear to cross much earlier.

### Model 5: The Natural Release
Think of skipping a stone or throwing a frisbee. Your arm extends OUT toward the target first, then rotation brings it around. The golf swing works the same way—extension toward ball, then rotation brings everything through.

## Integration with Swing Sequence

### Transition Phase
- Trail elbow begins reconnection to rib cage
- Upper arm aligns with body angle (~45° to spine)
- Hands begin journey toward midline while staying trail-side
- Hip rotation initiates but hasn't created visual illusion yet

### Delivery Phase (Lead Arm Parallel)
- Trail tricep fully reconnected to side
- Hands on trail side, approaching but not crossing midline
- Hips beginning to open but still relatively square
- This is where "shallowing" video typically freezes

### Release Phase (Pre-Impact to Impact)
- Arms uncocking and extending OUT toward ball
- Elbow moves approximately 8 inches out and around
- Hips rotating to 45° open position
- Visual illusion maximum: hands appear on front leg
- Reality: hands still trail-side relative to rotated body

### Follow-Through Phase (Post-Impact)
- Arms finally cross midline naturally
- "Shake hands with target" position achieved through rotation
- Adduction motion (arms across chest) happens here
- Not a conscious manipulation, but natural consequence of proper release

## Practice Recommendations

### Beginner Application
1. Start with body-square arm motion drill
2. Learn the feeling of arms staying trail-side
3. Use midline touch test to establish boundary
4. Practice impact position with hip reset repeatedly
5. Gradually add rotation to arm motion

### Intermediate Application
1. Incorporate elbow track monitoring into full swings
2. Use 45-degree camera angle awareness during video analysis
3. Practice Hank Haney circle drill to eliminate wiping
4. Focus on OUT component of release before rotation component
5. Compare feeling to tennis forehand for confirmation

### Advanced Application
1. Use 3D concepts to refine release timing
2. Monitor elbow-to-hip relationship through high-speed video
3. Experiment with amount of rotation vs. arm motion
4. Fine-tune side bend and shoulder line at impact
5. Integrate natural release into course play

## Key Takeaways

1. **The "Create Space" Myth**: You do NOT create space by moving arms across body—arms stay beside body while rotation provides clearance

2. **Visual Illusion Is Powerful**: Static camera angle makes hands appear to move left when they're actually staying trail-side relative to rotating body

3. **Hands at Impact**: Farther back on body than at address; appear forward only due to 45° hip rotation

4. **Release Path**: Arms move OUT toward ball at ~45° angle first, then rotation brings them around; not a wiping motion

5. **Trail Elbow Position**: Must stay behind trail hip and reconnect to rib cage; never work toward navel

6. **8-Inch Rule**: From shaft parallel to shaft parallel, arms move approximately 8 inches out and around toward ball

7. **Midline Boundary**: Hands approach but don't cross body centerline until well after impact; rotation creates appearance of crossing

8. **3D Motion Capture Advantage**: Can isolate segments to reveal truth hidden by camera angles; transforms understanding

9. **Stop-Motion Video Danger**: Has likely hurt more golfers than helped by encouraging positional fishing without motion understanding

10. **Training Solution**: Break out movements individually (arm motion separate from rotation), then combine them naturally

11. **The Light Bulb Moment**: Once you see how arm moves with rotation "turned off," the entire swing becomes clearer and easier to execute

12. **Natural vs. Manipulated**: Proper release feels like top-spin tennis forehand (easy), not low slice (forced)—trust the natural motion
