# Video 63: Why "Closing the Shoulders" is Ruining Your Golf Swing!

## Overview

This short instructional addresses a common misconception in golf instruction: the idea that players should actively "close the shoulders" over the hips during the downswing to maintain pelvis-shoulder separation. Athletic Motion Golf clarifies that this teaching advice contradicts what elite players actually do biomechanically. The video emphasizes the "lazy susan" concept—where the pelvis rotation naturally brings the upper body around while the arms drop and reconnect—as the true pattern observed in professional swings across generations.

## Key Concepts

### The "Closing the Shoulders" Misconception
- **The Faulty Instruction**: Some teaching circles suggest actively closing the shoulders over the hips throughout the downswing to maintain an "open pelvis" position
- **Why It's Problematic**: This approach directly contradicts the biomechanical patterns exhibited by elite players across generations
- **The Reality**: Great players don't actively close their shoulders independently; the rotation happens naturally through proper sequencing

### The Lazy Susan Principle
- **Core Concept**: The pelvis acts like a lazy susan turntable during the downswing
- **Mechanical Function**: As the pelvis rotates, it naturally brings everything above it (torso, shoulders, arms) around with it
- **Homogeneous Pattern**: This biomechanical sequence is remarkably consistent across all elite players throughout golf history
- **Visual Result**: This natural sequencing produces the classic "on-plane" swing appearance seen in professional swings

### Arm Action During Rotation
- **Primary Movement**: While the pelvis rotates (lazy susan effect), the arms are simply lowering and reconnecting
- **Key Distinction**: The arms aren't actively manipulated; they drop naturally as the body rotates
- **Sequencing Integration**: The combination of pelvic rotation + arm drop creates proper sequencing without forced shoulder closure
- **Plane Maintenance**: This coordinated movement keeps the club on plane automatically

## Biomechanical Analysis

### What Elite Players Actually Do
**Downswing Sequence**:
1. Pelvis initiates rotation (lazy susan begins turning)
2. Upper body (torso/shoulders) follows passively due to kinetic chain
3. Arms drop/lower while reconnecting to the body
4. Natural shoulder rotation occurs as consequence of #1-3, not as independent action

**Critical Insight**: The shoulder "closing" is an effect of proper sequencing, not a cause or action to be consciously performed.

### Why Fighting Natural Patterns Is Dangerous
- **Generational Proof**: Elite players have demonstrated consistent patterns over generations
- **Homogeneous Data**: The biomechanics are remarkably similar across diverse swing styles
- **Risk of Contrarian Approach**: Doing the opposite of what elite players do is "really dicey"
- **Evolutionary Efficiency**: The body has optimized these movement patterns for power and consistency

## Common Misconceptions Addressed

### Misconception #1: "Close the Gap Immediately"
**Question**: Should I close the shoulder-hip gap immediately at transition?
**Answer**: No—the gap closes naturally through proper sequencing, not through active manipulation

### Misconception #2: "Keep Closing Shoulders While Pelvis Stays Open"
**Question**: Should I actively close shoulders over hips throughout the downswing?
**Answer**: No—this creates an unnatural separation that elite players don't exhibit

### Misconception #3: "Maintain Maximum Separation"
**Question**: Is maximum pelvis-shoulder separation the goal?
**Answer**: No—natural separation occurs through sequencing, but forced separation disrupts the kinetic chain

## Key Takeaways

1. **Don't actively "close the shoulders"** over the hips during the downswing—this contradicts elite player biomechanics
2. **The lazy susan concept is fundamental**: Pelvis rotation naturally brings the upper body around
3. **Arm action is about lowering and reconnecting**, not manipulating or steering
4. **Elite player patterns are homogeneous** across generations—trust what actually works
5. **Natural sequencing produces the "on-plane" look** automatically without conscious shoulder manipulation
6. **Shoulder rotation is an effect, not an action** to be consciously performed

## Practical Application

### What to Feel
- Focus on pelvic rotation initiating the downswing
- Allow arms to drop/lower passively
- Let shoulders rotate as a consequence of pelvic turn
- Avoid any sense of "forcing" shoulder closure

### What to Avoid
- Actively trying to close shoulders independently
- Maintaining forced pelvis-shoulder separation
- Manipulating the relationship between pelvis and shoulder rotation
- Following advice that contradicts observable elite player patterns

## AMG Philosophy Reinforcement

This video exemplifies AMG's commitment to:
- **Data-driven instruction** based on what elite players actually do
- **Debunking popular misconceptions** that contradict biomechanical reality
- **Trusting generational patterns** rather than trendy teaching concepts
- **Explaining the "why"** through biomechanical principles (lazy susan concept)
- **Warning against contrarian approaches** that fight natural movement patterns

## Related Concepts

- Kinetic chain sequencing
- Pelvis-thorax relationship in rotation
- Ground force reaction and rotation
- Arm path and plane maintenance
- X-factor and dynamic X-factor (separation vs. closing rates)
