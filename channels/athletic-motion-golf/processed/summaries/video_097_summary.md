# Video 97: How Tour Players Achieve Perfect Positioning at the Top of the Golf Swing

## Overview
**Duration:** 0:58
**Instructor:** AMG Instructor
**Upload Date:** July 24, 2025
**Video ID:** NfUnKlEDM-M

## Main Teaching Objective
Demonstrate how tour players maintain solid wrist positions at the top of the backswing and introduce a training aid solution to prevent excessive wrist hinge and cupping that leads to an open clubface position.

## Key Biomechanics Concepts
- **Wrist stability at the top**: Tour players demonstrate consistent, controlled wrist positions that maintain clubface control
- **Lead wrist position**: Excessive cupping (dorsiflexion) of the lead wrist creates an open clubface position at the top
- **Controlled hinge**: Limited wrist hinge prevents overhinging while still allowing proper wrist set
- **Training aid mechanics**: Adjustable arm length provides customizable resistance to excessive wrist motion

## Tour Player Observations

1. **Solid Wrist Positions**
   - **Characteristic:** Tour players exhibit stable, non-excessive wrist angles at the top of the backswing
   - **Why it matters:** Maintains clubface control and consistency throughout the swing
   - **Visual cue:** Lead wrist appears relatively flat or slightly bowed, not cupped

2. **Controlled Hinge Amount**
   - **Characteristic:** Professional golfers avoid overhinging the wrists during the backswing
   - **Why it matters:** Excessive hinge combined with cupping creates a wide-open clubface position
   - **Impact:** Open clubface at the top requires compensatory movements in the downswing

## Common Faults Addressed

1. **Excessive Wrist Hinge**
   - **Why it happens:** Lack of awareness of wrist position, attempt to create more "swing length"
   - **How to identify:**
     - Lead wrist cups significantly at the top
     - Clubface points toward the sky at the top
     - Inconsistent ball striking patterns
   - **Impact:** Opens clubface excessively, requires compensatory manipulation through impact

2. **Lead Wrist Cupping**
   - **Why it happens:** Natural tendency when combined with overhinging, weak wrist control
   - **How to identify:**
     - Back of lead hand forms a concave angle
     - Visible crease in the back of the lead wrist
     - Clubface aims away from ball at top of swing
   - **Impact:** Major contributor to open clubface position and weak, sliced shots

## Solutions & Training Aids

1. **AMG Adjustable Wrist Trainer**
   - **Setup:**
     - Attach device to club using wing nut mechanism
     - Position arm against lead forearm
     - Adjust arm length based on desired wrist control level

   - **Key features:**
     - **Extendable arm**: Unlike traditional fixed-length devices, this trainer has adjustable arm length
     - **Customizable resistance**: Longer arm setting = more restriction on wrist hinge
     - **Hit-able design**: Can be used during full-swing ball striking practice

   - **Key differences from traditional wrist trainers:**
     - Traditional fixed-length trainers can still allow overhinging with certain grip pressures
     - Adjustable arm length provides precise control over maximum wrist hinge allowed
     - Enables progressive training (start with less restriction, increase as control improves)

   - **Usage protocol:**
     - Attach to club with proper positioning
     - Make backswing to the top
     - Feel the limited hinge restriction from the extended arm
     - Practice until proper wrist position becomes natural
     - Can progress to hitting full shots with the trainer attached

   - **Success metrics:**
     - Feeling of limited but sufficient wrist hinge
     - Improved clubface control at the top
     - More consistent ball striking
     - Reduced compensatory movements in downswing

2. **Proper Positioning Technique**
   - **Setup:** Ensure trainer arm is correctly positioned against forearm before starting

   - **Key feels:**
     - Arm provides gentle resistance as backswing progresses
     - Clear stopping point for wrist hinge
     - Maintained connection between trainer and forearm

   - **Verification:**
     - Check clubface position at top (should be square to slightly closed)
     - Monitor lead wrist angle (flat to slightly bowed)
     - Consistent trainer contact throughout backswing

## Equipment/Technology Mentioned
- **AMG Adjustable Wrist Trainer** - Available on Athletic Motion Golf website
  - Wing nut attachment system
  - Extendable/adjustable arm mechanism
  - Designed for use during ball striking practice

## Key Terminology
- **Solid wrists**: Stable, controlled wrist positions without excessive motion
- **Overhinge**: Excessive wrist cock beyond optimal position
- **Cuppy/cupping**: Dorsiflexion of the lead wrist (back of wrist bends backward)
- **Club face wide open**: Clubface pointing significantly toward sky at top of backswing
- **Wrist trainer**: Training aid designed to limit and control wrist motion
- **Wing nut**: Threaded fastener used to attach trainer to club
- **Extendable arm**: Adjustable component that can be lengthened or shortened
- **Limited hinge**: Controlled amount of wrist cock that maintains clubface control

## Training Aid Philosophy
The video demonstrates AMG's approach to training aid development:
1. **Problem identification**: Tour player analysis reveals optimal wrist positions
2. **Traditional solutions reviewed**: Existing wrist trainers have limitations
3. **Innovation**: Adjustable design addresses limitations of fixed-length trainers
4. **Progressive training**: Customizable settings allow gradual improvement
5. **Integration**: Can be used during actual ball striking, not just slow-motion practice

## Key Takeaways
1. **Tour players demonstrate consistent wrist control** - Solid wrist positions at the top are a hallmark of elite ball strikers
2. **Excessive cupping opens the clubface** - Lead wrist cupping combined with overhinging creates significant clubface control issues
3. **Adjustability matters in training aids** - Fixed-length wrist trainers may not prevent overhinging for all golfers
4. **Longer arm = more restriction** - Extending the trainer arm provides greater limitation on wrist hinge
5. **Position matters** - Correct positioning of the training aid on the club is essential for proper feedback
6. **Practice with balls** - This trainer can be used during full-speed swings with ball striking, not just slow-motion drills
7. **Proper wrist action improves contact** - Correcting wrist position leads to more solid ball striking

## Related Concepts
- Clubface control throughout the swing
- Lead wrist positions (flat, bowed, cupped)
- Top of backswing checkpoints
- Training aid usage and progression
- Tour player swing characteristics
- Compensatory movements in the downswing

## Practical Application Notes
**For golfers who:**
- Struggle with open clubface at the top
- Experience inconsistent ball flight (particularly slices)
- Have weak or inconsistent wrist positions
- Need kinesthetic feedback for proper wrist action
- Want to develop tour-quality wrist mechanics

**Training progression:**
1. Start with moderate arm extension setting
2. Practice slow-motion backswings focusing on feel
3. Progress to full-speed practice swings
4. Integrate ball striking with trainer attached
5. Remove trainer and verify position retention
6. Use periodically to reinforce proper feel
