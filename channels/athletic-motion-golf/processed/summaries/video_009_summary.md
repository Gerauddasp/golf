## Overview

This Athletic Motion Golf video presents a scientifically-grounded yet simple framework for fixing takeaway issues that plague most golfers. The core concept revolves around balancing two fundamental movements: the "Turn" dial (body rotation) and the "Lift" dial (arm elevation). Most golfers who struggle with the takeaway have practiced getting the club to the correct position without pivot, but when they add body rotation to create a real swing, everything gets sucked inside. The video demonstrates how to balance these two components to create proper swing plane geometry, using video analysis and the AMG Swing Coach app for feedback.

The lesson format includes live demonstrations with Sean Foley showing both incorrect (too much turn, not enough lift) and correct (balanced turn and lift) takeaways, explaining the biomechanical consequences of each pattern, and providing practical training methods using video technology.

## Key Concepts

### The Two-Dial System

**The Turn Dial (T)**: Body rotation that moves the club around your body
- Provides the horizontal component of the backswing
- Most golfers over-rotate without sufficient arm elevation
- Creates the "in" motion relative to the target line

**The Lift Dial (L)**: Arm and shoulder elevation that moves the club upward
- Provides the vertical component of the backswing
- Often neglected in favor of pure rotation
- Creates the "up" motion relative to the ground

**Core Principle**: Both dials must turn at roughly equal rates throughout the takeaway and backswing to maintain proper swing plane geometry.

### The 45-Degree Swing Plane Analogy

Using construction terminology: Think of a roof pitch
- **Equal proportions**: "Up one foot, in one foot" = 45-degree plane
- **Too steep (12/6 pitch)**: Too much lift, not enough turn
- **Too shallow (6/12 pitch)**: Too much turn, not enough lift
- Most amateur golfers have 6/12 pitch problems (too flat/inside)

Hank Haney's teaching cue: "Up in, up in, up in, up in" all the way to the top - emphasizing equal rates of both movements.

### The Mirror Practice Problem

**The Phenomenon**: Golfers can rehearse perfect takeaway positions in a mirror or slow-motion practice, moving the club "like a putter side to side."

**The Breakdown**: When they make a real swing with full body pivot at normal speed, the club gets sucked way inside because:
1. They're only moving the club with their hands/arms in practice
2. They add full body rotation to the real swing
3. The turn dial overwhelms the lift dial
4. Club gets trapped inside, leading to compensations (loop over the top or swing extremely from inside)

### Hand Path Relative to Swing Plane

**Critical Checkpoint**: Hands start below the swing plane at address
**Goal**: Hands must work up to and through the plane line early in the takeaway

**Two Ways to Raise Hands**:
1. **Elbow bend only**: Creates too much depth (hands stay under plane)
2. **Arm elevation (preferred)**: Raises the entire arm structure

**Optimal Pattern**: "A little bit of bend the elbow, but A LOT of raise the arm"

**Common Fault**: Elbow stays low, hands stay under plane too long, forcing late lift and layoff at the top

### The Teeter-Totter Effect

If movements are imbalanced:
- **Too much turn early** → Club gets stuck inside → Forces late lift → Club head rises (layoff)
- **Too much lift early** → Club gets outside → May need to drop or flatten in transition

**The Fix**: Match the lift dial to the turn dial from the very start of the takeaway

## Actionable Drills

### Drill 1: The Balanced Turn-Lift Rehearsal

**Purpose**: Train the neuromuscular pattern of equal-rate turn and lift
**Equipment**: None required (can use mirror for feedback)

**Setup**:
- Normal address position
- Focus on feeling both shoulder turn AND arm elevation simultaneously

**Execution**:
1. Start the takeaway thinking "up AND in" equally
2. Feel the upper arm elevating away from your body as you turn
3. Maintain the sensation that your hands are working UP toward and through the swing plane
4. Check halfway back: hands should be at or above the plane line
5. Continue to top: club should be "propped up" (not laid off)

**Success Markers**:
- Hands reach plane line by halfway back
- No sensation of arms getting "stuck" to your chest
- Club maintains proper relationship to swing plane throughout
- Top position has club over hands, not behind them

**Feel Notes** (from Sean's experience):
- May initially feel like arms are going "almost 45 degrees up"
- Similar to Kenny Perry or Freddy Couples' more elevated takeaway feel
- Feels much more "up" than your habitual pattern if you're too flat

### Drill 2: Overcorrection ("Bend the Spring")

**Purpose**: Break deeply ingrained patterns by temporarily overindexing the correction
**Concept**: When changing long-held patterns, you often need to "bend the spring" past neutral to counteract automatic reversion

**Setup**:
- Understanding that you've likely ingrained too much turn, not enough lift for years
- Accept that proper balance will initially feel exaggerated

**Execution**:
1. First attempt: Overdo the lift component (feel like you're going too far outside/up)
2. Hit balls with this exaggerated feel - note results
3. Second attempt: Allow some turn back into the pattern while maintaining increased lift
4. Find the middle ground where both dials are balanced
5. Repeat until the new pattern begins to feel more natural

**Success Markers**:
- First attempt may look closer to neutral than it feels
- Gradually the "correct" position feels less extreme
- Ball flight becomes more consistent
- Video shows hands staying on or above plane through takeaway

**Warning**: Don't expect immediate perfection - constant tweaking required until proper feel is established

### Drill 3: Video Analysis with Plane Line Reference

**Purpose**: Develop visual feedback to match kinesthetic feel with actual movement
**Equipment**: Video capability (smartphone, Swing Coach app, or camera with plane line drawing software)

**Setup**:
1. Set camera down-the-line view
2. Draw swing plane line from club at address through lead shoulder
3. Mark two checkpoints: takeaway position and halfway back

**Execution**:
1. Record your habitual takeaway
2. Review: Note where hands and elbows are relative to plane line
3. Most common fault: Hands under plane, elbows way under plane at both checkpoints
4. Make correction swing focusing on balanced turn-lift
5. Review immediately: Hands should reach plane line earlier, elbows closer to plane
6. Repeat with continuous feedback

**Success Markers**:
- **Takeaway checkpoint**: Hands working toward plane line (not staying below)
- **Halfway back checkpoint**: Hands at or above plane line, elbows much closer to plane
- **Top position**: Club above hands, proper shaft angle
- Ball contact and flight improve

### Drill 4: Swing Coach App Training (AMG Technology)

**Purpose**: Receive real-time audible feedback on hand path parameters
**Equipment**: iPhone with AMG Swing Coach app (Android coming soon)

**Setup**:
1. Download Swing Coach app (2-week free trial available)
2. Enable two parameters:
   - Takeaway hand path
   - Halfway back hand path
3. Position phone in down-the-line view
4. Calibrate to your swing

**Execution**:
1. Make practice swings
2. Listen for audible feedback (beep or tone when parameters are "in the zone")
3. No feedback = hands under plane (too much turn, not enough lift)
4. Positive feedback = hands on proper path (balanced dials)
5. Make adjustments based on real-time feedback
6. Build pattern recognition through repetition with immediate reinforcement

**Success Markers**:
- Consistent positive feedback on both parameters
- Ability to replicate good pattern without visual reference
- Improved ball striking when parameters are in zone
- Gradual reduction in swing thoughts needed to execute correctly

**Key Advantage**: Provides objective, immediate feedback during practice when coach isn't present

### Drill 5: Old School Plane Board/Mirror Work (With Body Turn)

**Purpose**: Practice proper takeaway mechanics without technology
**Equipment**: Mirror, plane board, or alignment stick propped at swing plane angle

**Setup**:
- Position visual aid to represent swing plane
- Practice in front of mirror to see body and club positions

**Critical Difference from Traditional Mirror Work**:
- DO NOT just move the club with your hands/arms
- MUST incorporate actual body pivot while watching
- Focus on coordinating arm lift WITH shoulder turn

**Execution**:
1. Address position with reference to plane line/board
2. Initiate takeaway with BOTH body turn AND arm elevation
3. Watch hands work up to plane line while shoulders rotate
4. Check halfway back position
5. Complete backswing maintaining plane relationship
6. Repeat 10-20 times focusing on coordination

**Success Markers**:
- Can replicate good position WITH full body turn (not just arms)
- Pattern looks the same in mirror with pivot as without
- Feels integrated rather than hands-only or body-only

## Key Takeaways

1. **The takeaway is about balancing TWO movements, not perfecting one position** - Think "T dial" (turn) and "L dial" (lift) turning at equal rates, not just getting the club to a checkpoint.

2. **Your practice swing lies to you** - Mirror rehearsals and slow-motion takeaways that look perfect often exclude the body pivot that causes the breakdown in real swings.

3. **Most golfers need MORE lift, not more turn** - The typical amateur fault is too much body rotation without corresponding arm elevation, getting everything stuck inside.

4. **Feels are personal and often exaggerated** - What feels like 45 degrees up might look normal on video. You need to "bend the spring" past neutral to counteract ingrained patterns.

5. **Hands must work UP to the plane line early** - Don't let hands stay under the plane through the takeaway. Elevate the arm structure, not just bend the elbow.

6. **Use technology for objective feedback** - Video analysis or swing apps like AMG Swing Coach provide the ground truth when your feels don't match reality.

7. **The correction requires constant tweaking** - When you fix one dial, you might neglect the other. Finding balance takes repetition and adjustment over multiple sessions.

8. **A good takeaway makes everything else easier** - Proper plane relationship from the start eliminates the need for compensations and complicated swing thoughts later in the swing.

## Related Concepts

**Swing Plane Geometry**: Understanding that proper swing plane is created by the RATE of upward vs. inward movement, not by any single position

**Kinematic Sequence**: Proper takeaway sets up the correct sequencing of body segments in transition and downswing

**Connection Training Pitfalls**: Training aids that emphasize connection (towel under arm, swing jacket, chest strap) can inhibit necessary arm elevation and create too-flat backswings

**Pattern Interruption**: When changing long-held patterns, temporary overcorrection helps break the old habit loop

**Feel vs. Real**: The common phenomenon where correct movements feel wrong initially because they differ from ingrained patterns

## Practice Recommendations

**For Immediate Implementation**:
- Start every practice session with 20 takeaway rehearsals focusing on equal turn-lift
- Record yourself from down-the-line at least once per practice session
- Use Swing Coach app or video for immediate feedback on first 10 balls

**For Long-Term Pattern Change**:
- Expect 4-6 weeks of focused practice before new pattern feels natural
- Continue to "overindex" the lift component early in the change process
- Gradually reduce the feel of exaggeration as the pattern stabilizes
- Revisit video analysis weekly to ensure change is maintained

**Red Flags to Watch**:
- Reverting to old pattern when trying to hit harder or under pressure
- Overcompensating on lift dial and neglecting turn (less common but possible)
- Getting club outside/across line if you go too far with correction

## Scientific Context

This AMG approach emphasizes:
- **Biomechanical efficiency**: Proper plane angles reduce compensatory movements
- **Kinematic relationships**: The coordination of body segments to create consistent geometry
- **Motor learning principles**: Using exaggerated feels and immediate feedback to reprogram movement patterns
- **Data-driven instruction**: Leveraging technology to provide objective measures of hand path and club position

The two-dial concept simplifies complex 3D motion into manageable components while maintaining scientific accuracy about what actually creates proper swing plane geometry.
