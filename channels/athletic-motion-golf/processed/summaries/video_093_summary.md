## Overview

This short instructional video clarifies the fundamental distinction between two essential short game shots: the chip and the pitch. Athletic Motion Golf uses a numbered system to categorize these shots—the chip is designated as "Number One" (low trajectory) and the pitch as "Number Two" (mid-height with spin). The key differentiator lies in the setup positions and backswing mechanics, specifically how the clubface orientation and swing path change between the two shots.

## Key Concepts

### AMG Short Game System Classification

**Number One (Chip Shot)**
- Definition: Low-trajectory shot that runs along the ground
- Purpose: Rolling approach to the pin with minimal airtime
- Trajectory: Low flight path

**Number Two (Pitch Shot)**
- Definition: Mid-height shot with spin that stops quickly on the green
- Purpose: Higher flight with controlled landing and minimal rollout
- Trajectory: Mid-height with descent angle sufficient for spin

### Setup Differences

**Chip Shot (Number One) Setup**
- Hands positioned higher at address
- Clubface stays hooded (de-lofted)
- Creates lower ball flight through reduced dynamic loft

**Pitch Shot (Number Two) Setup**
- Standard hand position (not elevated)
- Clubface square to slightly open
- Allows presentation of full club loft to the ball

### Backswing Mechanics: The Critical Distinction

**Chip Shot Backswing**
- Club moves straight back from the ball
- Face remains hooded throughout takeaway
- Minimal rotation of the clubface
- More linear swing path

**Pitch Shot Backswing**
- Toe of the club works upward during takeaway
- Club works "more around you" (rotational path)
- Face opens naturally relative to path
- Presents loft to the ball at impact

### Body Mechanics Through Impact

**Pitch Shot Finish Position**
- Body extends through the finish
- Weight transfers to lead side
- Full follow-through with torso rotation
- Creates the spin necessary for stopping power

## Actionable Drills

### Setup Comparison Drill

**Purpose**: Internalize the setup differences between chip and pitch shots
**Setup**:
1. Place two balls side by side, 6 inches apart
2. Take chip setup (Number One) over first ball: hands high, hooded face
3. Take pitch setup (Number Two) over second ball: standard hands, square face

**Execution**:
1. Alternate between the two setups without hitting
2. Feel the hand height difference
3. Observe face angle changes
4. Repeat 10 times to build muscle memory

**Success Markers**:
- Can instantly distinguish between the two positions
- Setup changes become automatic
- Clear visual difference in clubface loft at address

### Toe-Up Awareness Drill

**Purpose**: Develop the feel of the toe working upward in the pitch shot backswing
**Setup**:
1. Take pitch shot address position
2. Use a wedge (sand or lob wedge ideal)
3. Place alignment stick on ground parallel to target line

**Execution**:
1. Make slow-motion backswing
2. Focus exclusively on feeling the toe of the club rise
3. At waist height, check that clubface is visible (toe up)
4. Club should work "around you" not straight back
5. Repeat 15-20 times in slow motion
6. Progress to tempo swings, maintaining toe-up sensation

**Success Markers**:
- Can see the clubface looking at you at the top of short backswing
- Club feels like it's moving more rotational vs. linear
- Ball flight trajectory increases compared to standard chip

### Straight Back vs. Around Comparison Drill

**Purpose**: Contrast the swing paths between chip and pitch shots
**Setup**:
1. Place two clubs on ground forming a gate (target line reference)
2. Position ball in center

**Execution**:
1. **For Chip (Number One)**: Take club straight back between the gate, hooded face
2. Hit 5 shots observing low trajectory
3. **For Pitch (Number Two)**: Allow club to work more inside (around), toe up
4. Hit 5 shots observing higher trajectory with spin
5. Alternate between shot types

**Success Markers**:
- Clear trajectory difference between the two shot types
- Chip shots roll out significantly
- Pitch shots land softer with visible spin
- Can reproduce each pattern consistently

### Spin Production Validation Drill

**Purpose**: Verify proper pitch shot mechanics through observable spin
**Setup**:
1. Find landing area with receptive green or fringe
2. Use premium golf balls (spin-optimized)
3. Distance: 15-30 yards to landing zone

**Execution**:
1. Execute pitch shot (Number Two) technique:
   - Toe works up in backswing
   - Club works around body
   - Present loft to ball
   - Extend through finish
2. Observe ball reaction on landing
3. Ball should check up or spin back slightly
4. If ball doesn't spin, check: clubface too hooded, hands too far forward, straight-back path

**Success Markers**:
- Visible ball check-up on landing (1-3 feet)
- Occasional spin-back in ideal conditions
- Consistent mid-height trajectory
- Soft landing sound (not thud of low chip)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Chips and pitches are fundamentally different shots** requiring distinct techniques, not just different clubs or swing lengths

2. **The numbering system provides clarity**: Number One (chip) = low trajectory; Number Two (pitch) = mid-height with spin

3. **Setup dictates trajectory**: Hands high + hooded face = chip; standard hands + square face = pitch

4. **Backswing path is the critical differentiator**: Straight back = chip; toe-up and around = pitch

5. **Face rotation controls loft delivery**: Hooded face throughout = low flight; toe working up = presenting loft = higher flight

6. **Body extension through finish is essential** for pitch shots to generate the spin needed for stopping power

7. **Most golfers fail to differentiate** these shots around the greens, leading to inconsistent distance control and unpredictable rollout

## Shot Selection Guidelines

**Use Chip Shot (Number One) When:**
- Lots of green to work with
- Firm conditions
- Uphill approach to pin
- Want predictable roll
- Wind is a factor (lower trajectory more stable)

**Use Pitch Shot (Number Two) When:**
- Limited green to work with
- Need to stop ball quickly
- Over bunker or obstacle
- Downhill green
- Soft/receptive conditions
- Pin is close to front edge

## Common Errors

**Chip Shot Mistakes:**
- Not hooding face enough, resulting in higher than desired flight
- Hands too low at address
- Allowing face to rotate open in backswing

**Pitch Shot Mistakes:**
- Taking club straight back (chip motion) while trying to hit a pitch
- Hands too far forward, de-lofting the club
- Not allowing toe to work up in backswing
- Failing to extend body through finish
- Decelerating through impact

## Technical Insights

**Loft Presentation Mechanics:**
- Dynamic loft at impact determines trajectory
- Chip: hands forward + hooded face = reduced dynamic loft
- Pitch: square impact + natural loft presentation = increased dynamic loft

**Spin Generation Requirements:**
1. Clean contact (ball-first, then turf)
2. Sufficient clubhead speed
3. Descending angle of attack
4. Proper loft at impact
5. Face-to-path relationship that doesn't de-loft excessively

**Path and Face Relationship:**
- Chip shot: Face stays square to path (both straight back)
- Pitch shot: Face opens relative to path (path rotates inside, face works up)

## Practice Recommendations

**Beginner Focus:**
1. Master the setup differences first
2. Practice straight-back path for chips
3. Develop toe-up feel for pitches
4. Start with 10-yard shots to learn mechanics

**Intermediate Development:**
1. Work on path differentiation drills
2. Introduce trajectory control within each shot type
3. Practice shot selection based on lie and green conditions
4. Develop distance control for 3 different pitch distances

**Advanced Refinement:**
1. Fine-tune spin control with pitch shots
2. Master trajectory variations (low chip, mid chip, low pitch, high pitch)
3. Incorporate wind and lie angle adjustments
4. Develop pre-shot routine that includes shot classification (1 or 2)
