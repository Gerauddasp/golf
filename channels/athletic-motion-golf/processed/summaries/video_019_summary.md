# Video 19: Are You Losing Distance Because of This Pelvis Mistake?

## Overview

This video addresses a common biomechanical fault identified through 3D motion analysis at AMGC: excessive pelvis rotation during the backswing. When measured using the Gears system, many golfers demonstrate over-rotation of the pelvis, which creates a cascade of compensatory movements that reduce both power and consistency. The video presents a specific drill using a modified stance to develop proper pelvis rotation awareness and improve impact position.

## Key Biomechanical Issue

### Pelvis Over-Rotation Pattern
**The Problem Chain:**
1. **Backswing**: Excessive pelvis rotation (over-turning)
2. **Transition**: Pelvis moves too much toward target
3. **Top of Swing**: Excessive forward bend (increased spine angle)
4. **Impact**: Excessive backward tilt (loss of forward bend)

**Performance Consequences:**
- Ball flight errors: blocks and hooks
- Insufficient pelvis opening at impact
- Loss of distance due to poor kinematic sequence
- Inconsistent strike patterns

**3D Motion Analysis Finding**: This pattern is now one of the most common faults observed when golfers are measured using Gears 3D motion capture technology at the AMGC facility.

## Corrective Drill: Split-Stance Backswing

### Drill Setup
**Stance Modification:**
- Start in normal address position
- Move lead foot forward until it aligns with trail heel
- Creates split-stance configuration

### Execution Protocol

**Backswing Phase:**
- Make backswing from split-stance position
- **Key Feel**: Maintain weight on trail foot
- **Target Sensation**: Internal rotation of trail hip
- **Avoid**: Sliding pelvis backward toward target

**Downswing Phase:**
- At top of backswing, plant lead foot back into normal position
- Execute downswing and impact
- Hit easy shots initially to establish feel

### Biomechanical Objectives

**What This Drill Corrects:**
1. **Reduces over-rotation**: Split stance limits excessive pelvis turn
2. **Improves weight distribution**: Encourages proper load into trail side
3. **Develops internal rotation feel**: Trail hip rotates internally rather than sliding back
4. **Prevents lateral shift**: Stops pelvis from moving too far toward target
5. **Improves impact position**: Better pelvis opening and spine angles at impact

**Kinesthetic Learning:**
- The drill creates exaggerated constraint to develop correct movement pattern
- Weight retention on trail foot teaches proper loading mechanics
- Internal rotation feel is the key proprioceptive target

## Key Takeaways

1. **Pelvis over-rotation is a common modern fault** visible on 3D motion analysis systems
2. **The compensation pattern** includes excessive forward bend at top and backward tilt at impact
3. **Split-stance drill** restricts over-rotation while teaching internal hip rotation
4. **Focus on the feel** of weight on trail foot and internal rotation, not sliding back
5. **Start with easy shots** to develop the correct movement pattern before progressing to full swings

## Technical Notes

**3D Motion Analysis Context**: This fault pattern represents data-driven instruction based on Gears motion capture measurements of actual students at the AMGC facility, not theoretical swing mechanics.

**Progressive Implementation**: The drill uses a constraint-based learning approach—the split stance physically limits the unwanted motion while allowing the correct movement pattern to emerge.
