## Overview

This quick drill video demonstrates proper trail knee action through impact using a simple board training aid. The Athletic Motion Golf instructors explain how the knees should dynamically exchange roles during the downswing—the lead knee straightening while the trail knee flexes and drives toward the target. This biomechanical sequence is critical for creating the space needed for proper hip rotation and impact position, yet most golfers fail to execute this coordinated movement correctly.

## Key Concepts

### The Knee Exchange Pattern
- **Backswing**: Lead knee flexes and moves slightly toward the board (gentle brush, not aggressive movement)
- **Transition Point**: Knees "match" approximately halfway down—equal flexion at crossover
- **Downswing**: Lead knee extends (straightens) while trail knee simultaneously flexes
- **Impact**: Trail knee drives forward toward target and board, eventually matching lead knee position laterally

### Board Setup Protocol
- **Distance**: Approximately one club head width of space between setup position and board
- **Knee Position**: Place knees (or feet) up against the board at address
- **Space Creation**: The small gap allows for dynamic movement without restriction

### Trail Knee Action Mechanics
- **Direction**: Trail knee moves "toward the target" (not just rotating in place)
- **Contact**: Knee should contact board during downswing and "slide against" it
- **Final Position**: Trail knee ends up beside lead knee (stance width dependent)
- **Function**: Creates hip clearance and rotational space for proper impact alignment

## Actionable Drills

### Board Slide Drill
**Purpose**: Train proper trail knee drive and forward movement through impact
**Equipment**: Impact board, 2x4, or any vertical flat surface
**Setup**:
- Position board so knees/feet are against it at address
- Verify approximately one club head of space between body and board
- Take normal golf posture

**Execution**:
1. Make backswing—lead knee should gently brush board (no aggressive push)
2. Start downswing focusing on lead knee straightening
3. Simultaneously allow trail knee to flex and drive into board
4. Feel trail knee "slide" along board toward target
5. Finish with both knees relatively aligned laterally

**Success Markers**:
- Smooth contact with board (not jarring impact)
- Trail knee travels forward, not just rotates
- Increased hip turn and rotational space at impact
- No restriction or blocking sensation through impact zone

## Key Takeaways

1. **Knee coordination is reciprocal**: As lead knee straightens, trail knee must flex—they "exchange" roles during transition
2. **Trail knee travels forward**: The movement is toward the target along the board, not just rotational
3. **Halfway checkpoint**: Knees should match in flexion approximately halfway through downswing
4. **Space creation is the goal**: Proper trail knee drive creates the hip clearance necessary for powerful, unrestricted rotation
5. **Board training aid versatility**: AMG uses this simple tool in nearly every lesson for multiple swing applications

## Related Concepts

- Hip rotation mechanics and clearance
- Lead leg extension timing
- Trail side power generation
- Impact position alignment
- Lower body sequencing in the kinematic chain

## Technical Notes

**Common Error**: Trail leg straightening or "posting up" too early, which blocks hip rotation and causes compensations (early extension, loss of posture, casting)

**Biomechanical Principle**: The knee exchange creates the anatomical space required for the pelvis to continue rotating through impact without restriction—this is fundamental to efficient power transfer and club path control.

**Training Aid Alternative**: If no board available, use alignment stick vertically in ground, golf bag, or wall—any feedback mechanism that provides tactile reference for knee position and movement.
