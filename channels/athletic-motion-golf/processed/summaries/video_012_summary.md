## Overview

This short instructional video addresses one of golf's most frustrating shot patterns: topping the ball. Athletic Motion Golf identifies the root biomechanical cause—weight remaining too far back on the trail foot at impact—and provides a simple weight shift correction to eliminate topped shots. The fix focuses on getting the lead hip more forward during the downswing to enable proper ground contact and ball compression.

## Key Concepts

### Root Cause of Topped Shots

**Primary Issue**: Weight and body position too far back on trail foot at impact
- When weight stays back, golfer cannot hit down into the ground properly
- Body compensates by pulling arms closer to body
- Club contacts only the top portion of the ball ("nipping the top")
- Results in weak, low-trajectory shots

**Biomechanical Sequence**:
1. Weight stuck on trail (right) foot at impact
2. Body's center of mass too far behind ball
3. Arms pulled inward to reach ball
4. Club ascending or level at impact instead of descending
5. Contact made above ball's equator

### The Weight Shift Solution

**Correction**: Forward hip shift during transition and downswing
- Initiate weight transfer as downswing begins
- Move lead (left) hip more forward toward target
- Create feeling of weight shifting from right foot → left foot
- Achieve forward weight position by impact

**Impact Position Goals**:
- Majority of weight on lead foot at impact
- Lead hip positioned forward of address position
- Center of mass ahead of ball position
- Arms can extend naturally without pulling inward

## Actionable Drills

### Forward Hip Shift Drill

**Purpose**: Train proper weight transfer to eliminate topped shots and improve ground contact

**Setup**:
- Take normal address position with any club
- Make note of initial weight distribution (should be relatively even)
- Focus awareness on trail (right) foot and lead (left) foot

**Execution**:
1. Begin takeaway with normal motion
2. At top of backswing, feel weight loaded into trail side
3. **Critical moment**: As downswing starts, immediately shift lead hip forward
4. Feel weight actively transferring from right foot toward left foot
5. At impact position, most weight should be on left foot
6. Lead hip should be noticeably forward of starting position
7. Allow arms to extend naturally—don't pull them inward

**Key Feels**:
- "Weight is shifting from right foot to left foot"
- "Lead hip moving forward and slightly left"
- "Posting up on lead leg"
- "Pressure flowing from back foot to front foot"

**Success Markers**:
- Club brushes ground forward of ball position
- Divot taken after ball contact (with irons)
- Solid, compressed contact on ball
- Ball launches with proper trajectory
- No more topped shots
- Finish balanced on lead foot

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
- Starting downswing with arms instead of lower body
- Keeping weight on trail foot through impact
- Falling back onto trail foot after contact
- Forcing arms down without weight shift

## Key Takeaways

1. **Root Cause Identified**: Topped shots result primarily from weight staying too far back on the trail foot at impact

2. **Simple Biomechanical Fix**: Shift lead hip forward during downswing to transfer weight from trail foot to lead foot by impact

3. **Improved Ground Contact**: Forward weight position allows proper downward strike, brushing ground forward of ball

4. **Natural Arm Extension**: When weight moves forward, arms can extend naturally without pulling inward to compensate

5. **Immediate Application**: This is a feel-based correction that can be implemented immediately without complex technical changes

## Athletic Motion Golf Analysis

This video demonstrates AMG's characteristic approach of identifying the root biomechanical cause (weight back) rather than treating symptoms. The solution is presented as a single, actionable movement pattern—forward hip shift—that addresses the fundamental issue. The explanation includes the cause-effect relationship (weight back → arms pull in → topped contact) which helps golfers understand why the correction works, making it more likely to stick long-term.
