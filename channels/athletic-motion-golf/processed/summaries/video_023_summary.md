## Overview

This video debunks the common but harmful golf instruction to "keep your head still." Mike and Sean from Athletic Motion Golf explain that the head MUST move during the golf swing in order to appear stable. When golfers try to lock their head in place, they typically make one of two mistakes: either creating a "Happy Gilmore" style lifting motion or tilting the head excessively toward the target, resulting in a reverse pivot. The key insight is that head stability is a byproduct of proper body rotation, not a direct swing thought. The video demonstrates proper shoulder rotation mechanics and provides mirror drills and app-based feedback tools to train correct pivot motion that naturally produces ideal head movement.

## Key Concepts

### The "Feel vs. Real" Problem with Head Stillness

- Student came in with cue to "keep head still" but was actually tilting left side down (pouring water out of left ear)
- His feel was completely disconnected from reality - thought he was keeping head still while tilting dramatically
- Combined with "drive left shoulder down" cue, created severe reverse pivot
- **Critical principle**: The head needs to move in order to LOOK like it's not doing much

### Head Movement as Response to Body Motion

- Head movements should correspond to good pivot motion, not be independently controlled
- Like a gimbal on a camera - motors make it appear still, but it's moving everywhere
- Similar to cheetah running after prey or bird of prey flying - head appears stable but is actually moving constantly
- If you don't move your body, arms would go nowhere; same with head - it responds to body rotation
- **Key insight**: You don't have a head issue, you have a pivot issue

### Common Head-Locking Mistakes

**Mistake #1: "Happy Gilmore" Motion**
- Lifting and swaying excessively when trying to keep head locked
- Reference to Caddyshack film character

**Mistake #2: Excessive Left Tilt**
- As club moves in its plane, body makes head go toward target
- Pouring water too much out of left ear
- Tilting head to left too much
- Puts golfer in bad spot to start downswing

### Mobility Individual Differences (TPI Perspective)

- Greg Rose and TPI mobility tests referenced
- Individual mobility, flexibility, and body build affect head movement patterns
- If you have poor neck mobility and rotate shoulders correctly, may see half a head's worth of movement - that's fine
- Same body movements produce different head movements based on individual mobility restrictions
- **Important**: Solution to restrictions is NOT to force head still - this creates rocking/blocking pattern

### Shoulder Rotation Plane Geometry

**The Across vs. Down Relationship**
- Due to forward spine tilt, shoulders rotate MORE ACROSS than down
- Only equal down/across movement would occur at 90-degree spine angle (like Michelle Wie setup)
- No one swings like that, nor should they
- **Key feel**: Shoulder goes "across" with minimal "down"
- Because you're bent forward, some down occurs naturally - don't force additional down movement

**Lead Shoulder Misconception**
- "Drive left/lead shoulder down" is a terrible cue
- Golfers cheat this in 3/4 second backswing, going too far low and left
- Prevents shoulder from flowing across into good pivot motion
- Destroys width at top of swing
- Compromises spine angle

## Actionable Drills

### Drill 1: Mirror Shoulder Rotation (Face-On View)

**Purpose**: Train proper shoulder rotation plane without head compensation
**Equipment**: Full-length mirror or smartphone propped up as mirror
**Setup**:
- Stand facing mirror in golf posture
- Place piece of tape on mirror or use mirror edge as reference line next to your head
- Place club across shoulders (holding at ends)

**Execution**:
1. Position reference line/tape beside your head in setup
2. Rotate shoulders by moving left/lead shoulder ACROSS (not down)
3. Left shoulder should move from starting position out toward front of chin
4. Monitor that head stays near reference line - doesn't float laterally toward target
5. You'll see lots of shoulder motion but minimal rib cage/head lateral displacement
6. Complete rotation into finish position

**Success Markers**:
- Shoulders rotate in tilted plane (more across than down)
- Head maintains position relative to vertical reference line
- Lead shoulder travels toward chin, not toward ground
- Natural flow without locking sensation
- Can unwind hips smoothly from this position
- If you have mobility restrictions, half a head's width of movement is acceptable

**Common Errors**:
- Shoulder moving too far down vs. across
- Head drifting laterally toward target (floating with shoulders)
- Trying to lock head completely still
- Lifting motion (Happy Gilmore style)

### Drill 2: Swing Coach App Head Tracking

**Purpose**: Provide real-time feedback on head position during full swings with ball
**Equipment**:
- Athletic Motion Golf Swing Coach App (iOS, Android coming)
- Smartphone or tablet
- Hitting net or range

**Setup**:
1. Download AMG Swing Coach App (2-week free trial available)
2. Position camera face-on to capture full swing
3. Enable head tracking feature
4. App will create "window" zones for head position at top of backswing and impact

**Execution**:
1. Make practice swing focusing on shoulder rotation across (not down)
2. App provides instant audio/visual feedback (green = good, other alerts for out of zone)
3. If head moves outside window: identify if it's backswing or downswing issue
4. Make immediate adjustment on next swing based on feedback
5. If correction needed: emphasize shoulder traveling across vs. upward or downward

**Success Markers**:
- Green feedback at top of backswing
- Green feedback at impact
- Consistent head position across multiple swings
- Natural, flowing pivot motion
- No sensation of locking or restricting

**Coaching Tips from App**:
- If head exits window, coaching video pops up automatically
- Video demonstrates correct movements
- Can apply correction immediately to next swing
- Eliminates guessing at the range

**Alternative for Android Users**:
- Use phone video camera
- Record face-on view
- Use mirror edge or vertical line in background as reference
- Review video after each swing for feedback

### Drill 3: Down-the-Line Shoulder Plane Check

**Purpose**: Verify shoulders rotate on correct plane relative to spine angle
**Equipment**: Mirror or video camera, club across shoulders

**Setup**:
- Position down-the-line (facing target, camera viewing from behind)
- Place club across shoulders
- Establish normal golf posture with spine tilt

**Execution**:
1. Observe your spine angle in setup
2. Rotate shoulders around spine axis
3. Club across shoulders should move FARTHER ACROSS than DOWN
4. Think "rotating around spine" not "tilting shoulders"
5. Lead shoulder travels toward chin area, not toward ground
6. Complete turn into finish

**Success Markers**:
- Shoulders rotate perpendicular to spine angle
- More across motion than down motion
- Natural width maintained at top
- Spine angle remains consistent
- Head follows body naturally without lateral drift

## Biomechanical Principles

### The Gimbal Effect
- Head acts like stabilized camera gimbal
- Motors (body rotation) create apparent stability while actually moving constantly
- Stability is OUTPUT of good motion, not INPUT as swing thought

### Pivot-Centered Movement
- Body movements are primary
- Head movements are secondary response
- Fix pivot issues to fix head movement issues
- Don't treat head movement as independent variable

### Individual Biomechanics
- Each golfer's mobility profile creates unique head movement pattern
- Same quality pivot produces different head movements based on flexibility
- Restriction doesn't mean "lock head still" - means "optimize pivot within your mobility"

## Technology Training Tools

## Key Takeaways

1. **The head MUST move during the swing** - trying to keep it completely still creates harmful compensations (reverse pivot, excessive tilt, or lifting)

2. **Head stability is a byproduct of proper pivot motion** - fix body movement first, then head will naturally move correctly

3. **Two common mistakes when locking head**: Happy Gilmore lifting motion OR excessive left tilt ("pouring water from left ear")

4. **Shoulders rotate MORE ACROSS than DOWN** - due to forward spine tilt, shoulder plane is not 1:1 down/across ratio

5. **"Drive left shoulder down" is harmful advice** - causes golfers to get too low and left, destroying width and spine angle

6. **Individual mobility matters** - same quality pivot produces different head movements based on flexibility; half a head's width of movement is fine with restrictions

7. **Use feedback tools religiously** - mirror, video, or AMG Swing Coach App to confirm feel matches reality

8. **The gimbal analogy is key** - head appears still but is actually moving constantly in response to body rotation, like stabilized camera

9. **Train pivot first**: Mirror drill with club across shoulders establishes correct shoulder rotation plane before adding full swing

10. **Feel vs. Real disconnect is huge** - student thought he was keeping head still while actually tilting dramatically left; objective feedback is essential

## Practice Progression

1. **Week 1**: Master mirror drill face-on with club across shoulders (5-10 minutes daily)
2. **Week 2**: Add down-the-line mirror drill to verify shoulder plane (5 minutes daily)
3. **Week 3**: Integrate drills into range warm-up, use video feedback every 5 swings
4. **Week 4**: Use AMG Swing Coach App or video for full swing feedback with balls
5. **Ongoing**: Periodic mirror drill check-ins to maintain proper pivot pattern

## Final Coaching Cue

"Shed the idea of keeping your head still. Look at what the body's doing, because the head should respond to what the body's doing. Fix the pivot movement first, then allow your head to learn how to move correctly. You'll build a better swing because of it."
