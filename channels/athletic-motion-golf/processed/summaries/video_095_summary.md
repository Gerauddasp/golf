# Video 095: This 'LONG & SLOW SWING' is a Short Game Cheat Code!

## Overview

This short lesson reveals a PGA Tour player's secret for hitting high, soft shots around the green with exceptional control. The counter-intuitive technique emphasizes that swing tempo, rather than setup alone, is the critical factor in executing successful flop shots. The "long and slow" tempo allows proper club-face interaction with the ball to generate maximum height and spin.

## Key Concepts

### The Long & Slow Tempo Principle
- **Primary Element**: Swing tempo is more important than setup positions for high soft shots
- **Mechanism**: Slow tempo allows the clubface to slide under the ball cleanly
- **Application**: Even on short-distance shots, make a longer, slower swing rather than a quick short one
- **Result**: Ball launches nearly vertical with soft landing characteristics

### Setup Fundamentals (Secondary)
- **Face Position**: Open the clubface to increase effective loft
- **Weight Distribution**: Lean weight toward the lead side (left for right-handed golfers)
- **Note**: While important, these setup elements are subordinate to tempo control

### Biomechanical Rationale
- **Tempo Control**: Slower backswing and downswing speeds allow better proprioceptive feedback
- **Club Path Management**: Reduced acceleration permits shallower angle of attack
- **Face-Ball Interaction**: Extended contact time with slower speeds enhances spin production
- **Trajectory Control**: Combination of loft, speed, and path creates high launch with low forward velocity

## Actionable Drills

### Long & Slow Flop Shot Drill

**Purpose**: Develop the tempo awareness necessary for consistent high, soft shots around the green

**Setup**:
- Select a lob wedge (58-60°)
- Position ball in standard short game location
- Open clubface approximately 20-30° from target line
- Shift 60% of weight to lead foot
- Position hands slightly behind ball at address

**Execution**:
1. Take a practice swing focusing exclusively on tempo (ignore result)
2. Make backswing that reaches approximately waist height
3. Consciously slow the transition from backswing to downswing
4. Maintain slow tempo throughout the entire downswing
5. Finish with full follow-through to mirror backswing length
6. Focus on the rhythm being "1-2-3" rather than "1-2" (adding pause at transition)

**Success Markers**:
- Ball launches with steep trajectory (60-70° from horizontal)
- Minimal forward roll after landing (less than 2 feet)
- Consistent contact point on clubface (center to slightly heel-side)
- Swing feels unhurried despite full motion
- Ability to control distance with tempo rather than swing length

**Progression**:
- **Stage 1**: Practice with no target, focusing purely on tempo consistency
- **Stage 2**: Add distance targets at 10, 15, and 20 yards
- **Stage 3**: Introduce small landing zones to refine precision
- **Stage 4**: Practice from various lies (light rough, tight lies, upslopes)

### Tempo Exaggeration Drill

**Purpose**: Internalize the contrast between quick tempo (common mistake) and proper slow tempo

**Setup**:
- Same as primary drill
- Use practice balls or training area

**Execution**:
1. Hit one shot with deliberately quick tempo (common mistake pattern)
2. Observe result (typically thin contact or excessive distance)
3. Hit next shot with exaggeratedly slow tempo (70% of normal speed)
4. Observe improved trajectory and spin
5. Alternate between speeds to build kinesthetic awareness

**Success Markers**:
- Clear differentiation in ball flight between quick and slow tempos
- Recognition of "feeling too slow" as actually being correct
- Ability to reproduce slow tempo consistently over 5+ consecutive shots

## Key Takeaways

1. **Tempo is Primary**: The slowness of the swing tempo matters more than setup positions for high, soft shots around the green
2. **Long, Not Short**: Counter-intuitively, make a longer swing at slower speed rather than a short, quick swing for delicate shots
3. **Slide Underneath**: The slow tempo allows the clubface to slide cleanly under the ball, maximizing loft and spin
4. **Setup Supports Tempo**: Open face and forward weight create conditions for success, but only when combined with proper tempo
5. **Tour-Level Insight**: This technique represents proven PGA Tour methodology for reliable short game performance

## Technical Notes

**Skill Level**: Intermediate to Advanced
- Requires existing short game foundation
- Demands good tempo awareness and control
- Benefits golfers struggling with inconsistent flop shot execution

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
- Rushing the swing despite proper setup
- Making short, quick swing for short shots (intuitive but incorrect)
- Focusing on setup while neglecting tempo component
- Trying to "help" the ball up with hands or wrists

**Equipment Considerations**:
- Higher loft wedges (58-60°+) facilitate easier execution
- Wedges with more bounce help prevent digging
- Grooves in good condition maximize spin potential

## Related Concepts

- Tempo-based distance control throughout short game
- Relationship between swing speed and spin generation
- Role of deceleration in precision short game shots
- Application of "long and slow" principle to other delicate shots (bunker, tight lies)
