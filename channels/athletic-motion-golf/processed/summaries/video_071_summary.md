## Overview

This short video reveals the critical angle of attack data for fairway woods based on Trackman analysis of PGA Tour players. Athletic Motion Golf explains that elite players use a zero (neutral) angle of attack with fairway woods, with faster swingers going only slightly negative. The key insight is that amateur golfers should aim to contact the ball at the absolute bottom of the swing arc, creating a sweeping motion rather than a descending or ascending blow.

## Key Concepts

### PGA Tour Angle of Attack Data

**TrackMan Research Findings**:
- Elite players: Zero angle of attack (neutral)
- Slightly negative: 1-2 degrees down maximum
- Faster swing speeds: May creep down 2-3 degrees
- Overall pattern: Pretty neutral across all fairway woods (3W, 5W, 7W)

**What This Means for Amateurs**:
- Target: Zero angle of attack
- Contact point: Very bottom of the swing arc
- Not descending (like irons)
- Not ascending (like driver with tee)
- Ball position and setup should facilitate this neutral contact

### The "Bottom of Arc" Contact Feel

**Proper Contact Sensation**:
- Brush the sole of the club through impact
- "Barely tickle the grass" where the ball sits
- Feel the entire sole making ground contact
- Sweep through, don't dig down or lift up

**Result**:
- Ball contacts sweet spot on face
- Strike location: Just above bottom groove
- Impact zone: Lower-middle portion of face
- Produces optimal launch and spin characteristics

## Actionable Drills

### Sole-Brushing Practice Drill

**Purpose**: Develop the feel of zero angle of attack with fairway woods

**Setup**:
- Use any fairway wood (3W, 5W, 7W)
- Flat lie on range or fairway
- Ball positioned slightly forward of center
- Can practice without ball initially

**Execution**:
1. Make practice swings focusing on brushing the sole
2. Listen for the "swoosh" of grass contact at the bottom
3. Ensure club doesn't dig or bounce
4. Add ball and replicate same sweeping motion
5. Feel the entire sole making brief ground contact
6. Focus on the sensation of "tickling" the grass

**Success Markers**:
- Consistent shallow divots or no divot
- Sound: Clean "thump" rather than "thud" (fat) or "click" (thin)
- Ball flight: Optimal trajectory with penetrating flight
- Contact location: Just above the bottom groove on clubface
- Ground interaction: Minimal disruption to turf

### TrackMan Verification Drill (If Available)

**Purpose**: Confirm angle of attack matches Tour player data

**Setup**:
- Access to launch monitor with angle of attack measurement
- Multiple fairway woods
- Typical course lie conditions

**Execution**:
1. Hit 10-15 shots with each fairway wood
2. Monitor angle of attack readings
3. Target: -1° to +1° (zero neutral range)
4. Adjust ball position if consistently outside range
5. Note: Faster swingers may see -2° to -3° (still acceptable)

**Success Markers**:
- Angle of attack: -1° to +1° for most players
- Faster swingers: -2° to -3° acceptable
- Consistent readings across multiple shots
- Optimal launch angle for each club
- Center face contact pattern

## Key Takeaways

1. **PGA Tour Standard**: Elite players use zero (neutral) angle of attack with fairway woods, not a descending blow like irons

2. **Bottom of Arc Contact**: The goal is to contact the ball at the very bottom of the swing arc—not on the way down or up

3. **The Sweeping Feel**: Focus on brushing the sole of the club through the grass where the ball sits, barely "tickling" the turf

4. **Optimal Face Contact**: Proper angle of attack produces contact just above the bottom groove, in the lower-middle portion of the face

5. **Speed Consideration**: Faster swing speeds may naturally produce 2-3 degrees down, which is still considered neutral for fairway woods

## Technical Notes

**Scientific Basis**:
- TrackMan launch monitor data from PGA Tour players
- Angle of attack: The vertical direction of the clubhead's center of gravity movement at maximum compression
- Zero angle of attack = level (parallel to ground)
- Negative = descending, Positive = ascending

**Why This Matters**:
- Fairway woods have larger soles designed to sweep through turf
- Too steep (negative) creates heavy contact and reduced distance
- Too shallow (positive) risks thin/topped shots
- Neutral attack optimizes launch, spin, and distance

**Equipment Considerations**:
- Modern fairway woods designed for sweeping motion
- Sole design facilitates ground interaction at neutral angle
- Face height positions sweet spot for this contact pattern
