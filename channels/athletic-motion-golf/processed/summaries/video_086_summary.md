# Video 86: Do Pro Golfers ACTUALLY Lead With Their Elbow in the Downswing?

**YouTube ID**: 9pR58CtPz7g
**Duration**: 0:55

## Overview

This short video continues AMG's biomechanical analysis debunking the popular golf instruction myth that elite players "lead with their elbow" in the downswing. Using 3D motion capture data and a pelvis box reference frame, the video analyzes a second unnamed professional (former world #1 and multiple major champion) who is frequently cited as the prototype example of elbow-lead technique. The data reveals that even this player—often used to support the elbow-lead teaching—actually moves his elbow outside and deeper (toward the hip) throughout the downswing, contradicting the visual illusion.

This appears to be part of a multi-video series systematically examining this technique concept across different professional players.

## Key Concepts

### The "Elbow Lead" Myth
- **Common Teaching**: Pros get their trail elbow quickly in front of their centerline/pelvis during the downswing
- **Reality**: Even players cited as prime examples of this move actually do the opposite
- **The Illusion**: 2D video angles create optical illusions about true 3D elbow position relative to the body

### Pelvis Box Reference Frame
- **Measurement Tool**: 3D box aligned with the pelvis orientation
- **Purpose**: Provides objective reference for determining if elbow is "in front" vs "outside/behind"
- **Inside the Box**: Elbow positioned forward of the pelvis plane
- **Outside the Box**: Elbow positioned laterally or behind the pelvis plane

### Checkpoint Analysis System
- **Checkpoint 1 (Address)**: Elbow well inside pelvis box (setup position)
- **Checkpoint 2 (Early Backswing)**: Less shoulder rotation keeps elbow barely inside box, still in front
- **Checkpoint 3 (Mid-Backswing)**: First time elbow moves outside the box (no longer "in front")
- **Checkpoint 4 (Top of Backswing)**: Elbow continues moving outside and deeper toward trail hip
- **Checkpoint 5 (Mid-Downswing)**: Well past downswing midpoint, elbow has moved even farther outside and deeper

### Actual Elbow Movement Pattern
- **Direction**: Outside (laterally) and deep (toward trail hip)
- **Timing**: Begins in backswing (checkpoint 3), continues through downswing
- **Consistency**: Mirrors the pattern seen in "pro number one" (referenced from previous video)
- **Magnitude**: Progressively increases throughout the motion sequence

## Biomechanical Insights

### Why the Illusion Exists
1. **2D Video Perspective**: Camera angles compress 3D motion into 2D planes
2. **Relative Motion**: Elbow may appear to lead relative to hands while actually moving outside relative to pelvis
3. **Rotation Effects**: Body rotation can make lateral movement appear as forward movement
4. **Selective Attention**: Observers focus on hand-elbow relationship rather than elbow-pelvis relationship

### Actual Professional Pattern
- **Setup**: Trail elbow starts inside pelvis box (anatomically natural)
- **Transition Point**: Elbow exits the box during backswing, not downswing
- **Downswing Reality**: Elbow continues moving outside and deep, not forward/in front
- **Impact Implications**: This pattern allows proper sequencing and shaft shallowing

### Reference Frame Matters
- **Hand-Relative**: Elbow may lead relative to hands (true)
- **Body-Relative**: Elbow moves outside relative to pelvis (also true)
- **Teaching Confusion**: Mixing reference frames creates contradictory instruction
- **Objective Standard**: Pelvis box provides consistent, reproducible measurement

## Technical Analysis

### Pro #2 Specific Characteristics
- **Background**: Former world #1, multiple major champion
- **Reputation**: Frequently cited as prototype elbow-lead player
- **Shoulder Rotation**: Less shoulder rotation at checkpoint 2 compared to pro #1
- **Pattern Consistency**: Despite individual differences, follows same outside-deep elbow path
- **Data Confirmation**: Even the "best example" of elbow-lead doesn't actually lead with elbow

### Measurement Objectivity
- **3D Motion Capture**: Eliminates 2D video illusions
- **Pelvis-Referenced**: Uses body segment as stable reference
- **Sequential Checkpoints**: Documents position changes throughout swing
- **Quantifiable**: "Farther outside," "deeper toward hip" indicate measurable differences

## Key Takeaways

1. **The player most often cited as leading with his elbow actually moves his elbow outside and deep throughout the swing**—the visual appearance contradicts the 3D biomechanical reality

2. **The elbow exits the pelvis box during the backswing (checkpoint 3), not the downswing**—by the time the downswing begins, the elbow is already outside

3. **At mid-downswing (checkpoint 5), the elbow has moved even farther outside the box and deeper toward the trail hip**—the opposite direction of "leading"

4. **This pattern mirrors what AMG documented in "pro number one"**—suggesting this is a consistent biomechanical pattern across elite players, not individual variation

5. **Even with less shoulder rotation, the fundamental elbow movement pattern remains the same**—individual swing characteristics don't change this underlying biomechanical principle

6. **Reference frames matter critically in instruction**—an elbow can appear to lead relative to hands while moving outside relative to the body

## Implications for Golfers

### For Students
- **Question Visual Cues**: What looks like "elbow forward" on video may be optically deceiving
- **Understand Reference Frames**: "In front of" must be defined—in front of what exactly?
- **Trust Biomechanics Over Feels**: The sensation and visual appearance often contradict reality
- **Avoid This Feel**: Actively trying to lead with the elbow contradicts what pros actually do

### For Instructors
- **Challenge Popular Myths**: Even widely accepted teaching points may be biomechanically false
- **Use 3D Data**: 2D video analysis can mislead both teacher and student
- **Define Reference Frames**: Specify whether describing hand-elbow or elbow-body relationships
- **Update Mental Models**: Players cited as examples may not actually demonstrate the technique claimed

### For Self-Coaches
- **Be Skeptical of Visuals**: What you see in swing videos may not represent actual 3D positions
- **Seek Objective Measurements**: 3D data trumps 2D observation
- **Study Complete Patterns**: Don't isolate one checkpoint—trace the full movement sequence
- **Research Context**: This is part of a series—watch related videos for complete picture

## Related Concepts

### Connected Topics
- **Pro #1 Analysis**: Previous video in series showing same pattern in different elite player
- **Shaft Shallowing**: Outside-deep elbow path facilitates proper club delivery
- **Sequencing**: Body-relative elbow position affects kinematic sequence efficiency
- **Right Hip Turn**: Deep elbow movement connects to proper hip rotation pattern

### Further Investigation Needed
- **Pro #3, #4, etc.**: Presumably more players analyzed in extended series
- **Correct Feel/Thought**: If not "elbow lead," what should players think about?
- **Teaching Alternatives**: What cues produce this outside-deep pattern naturally?
- **Common Errors**: What happens when amateurs try to lead with elbow?

## Video Context

**Series Note**: This appears to be video #2 in a multi-part series examining the elbow-lead concept across multiple professional players. The reference to "pro number one" and systematic checkpoint methodology suggest this is part of a comprehensive research project.

**Duration Note**: At 55 seconds, this is a concise presentation of data—likely excerpted from longer analysis or paired with other shorts in the series.

**Unnamed Players**: AMG doesn't identify the professionals, likely focusing on biomechanical patterns rather than player-specific analysis.

## Scientific Rigor

### Strengths
- **3D Motion Capture**: Gold standard biomechanical measurement
- **Objective Reference Frame**: Pelvis box provides reproducible standard
- **Multiple Subjects**: Testing across different elite players strengthens conclusions
- **Systematic Checkpoints**: Sequential analysis documents pattern development
- **Myth Testing**: Specifically examines player cited as prototype example

### AMG Methodology
- **Data-Driven**: Uses objective measurements over subjective observation
- **Myth-Busting**: Directly challenges popular but incorrect teaching concepts
- **Practical Application**: Connects research findings to instruction implications
- **Visual Presentation**: Shows data in accessible format for non-scientists

## Practical Applications

Since this video primarily debunks what NOT to do, practical application is mostly negative (avoid trying to lead with elbow). For positive instruction on proper downswing elbow movement, golfers should reference:
- Other videos in this AMG series
- AMG content on shaft shallowing
- AMG content on proper sequencing
- Instruction on trail side movement patterns
