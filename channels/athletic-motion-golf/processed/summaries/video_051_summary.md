## Overview

This video addresses a common issue where golfers attempting to fix a steep downswing actually make it worse by mistiming when they add depth to their backswing. Athletic Motion Golf explains the biomechanical principle that elite players follow: they delay moving their arms across (adding depth) until after the lead arm reaches parallel to the ground. The incorrect approach—bringing the hands "in" early—forces compensatory movements that create the very steepness players are trying to eliminate. Through analysis of tour players like Rory McIlroy and practical drills, the instructors demonstrate how proper sequencing of the "up" and "in" movements in the backswing automatically creates the desired shallow downswing without manual manipulation.

## Key Biomechanical Concepts

### The Up vs. In Timing Principle

**Core Concept**: The golf swing is fundamentally an up-and-down motion combined with rotation, not an across-the-body motion as commonly perceived.

- **Tour player pattern**: Elite players don't move their arms across until after the lead arm reaches parallel to the ground
- **Critical angle measurement**: The angle from elbow joint → center of shoulder joint → C7 (base of neck) remains constant or slightly increases until lead arm parallel
- **Universal truth**: "There's up in the swing somewhere"—if you don't get the arms up early, you must compensate by going up late
- **Putter analogy**: Putting motion goes back and through; full swing goes up and down (plus rotation)

### The Late Flop Problem

**Biomechanical sequence of the faulty pattern**:

1. **Early depth**: Golfer brings hands "in" (across) too early in backswing
2. **Forced late lift**: With arms already across, the only way to complete backswing is to go "up" late
3. **Club laid off**: Late upward motion pitches the club into a laid-off position at the top
4. **Inevitable steepening**: When the golfer pulls down from this laid-off position, physics dictates the club will "tumble steep"

**Weight-catching analogy**: "It's like if Mike threw me a ball, I'm going to catch that weight and send it back to him. If I catch it as it's going that way to finish and I pull on it to send it down to the ball, it's going to tumble steep over the top."

### Slack and Sequencing

**Why leaving "slack" matters**:

- **Directional space**: Delaying the "in" movement leaves room for a downward hand path at transition
- **Proper sequencing**: Arms can move slightly downward while the body begins rotating, creating separation
- **Natural shallowing**: The combination of downward hand path start + body rotation produces the curved hand path seen in elite players
- **Anatomical necessity**: Adult male golfers with broader shoulders and thicker chests need this space; eating it up early leaves "nowhere for the arm to go"

### The "Perfect Sickle" Shape

**Rory McIlroy case study**:

- Leaves slack in the backswing by delaying depth
- Gets depth "a little later" in the backswing
- Creates the ideal "sickle" shape at the top
- On the downswing, he's "caught the weight of that club head coming back towards him"
- Adding pivot to this downward catch creates automatic shallowing
- **Key insight**: "You don't need to manually shallow the club. It's a backswing motion that allows you to do that correctly."

## Self-Diagnosis Checkpoint

### Down-the-Line Camera Analysis

**Setup**: Film yourself from down the line (caddy angle)

**Checkpoint position**: Lead arm parallel to ground in backswing

**What to look for**:
1. **Hand position**: Where is your lead hand (glove hand) relative to your centerline?
2. **Too far back = problem**: If hands are way behind your center line, you need "more up and less in earlier"
3. **Rib cage rotation**: There's more thoracic rotation than most golfers think at this position
4. **Address comparison**: When you square your chest back to camera without moving arms, hand position should be similar to address

### The "Pull Hands In" Test

**How to perform**:
1. Get to lead arm parallel position
2. Pull your hands straight into your chest
3. Note where they land—should be mid-chest

**Correct pattern**: Hands pulled in land at mid-chest
**Incorrect pattern**: Hands pulled in miss the critical mid-chest spot (too far across)

**Visual cue**: If your glove hand is on your "backline" (too deep) at lead arm parallel, "you're going to have a heck of a time not getting steep early"

### The Critical Three Points

**Address position angle**: Elbow joint — shoulder center — C7 (base of neck)

**Tour player pattern from address → lead arm parallel**:
- This angle either increases slightly OR
- Decreases by only a couple of degrees
- Individual variation based on shoulder width and arm length

**Kiss of death**: When this angle closes significantly early (hands across early), forcing late lift and subsequent steepness

## Corrective Drills

### Drill 1: One-Handed Weighted Club (Scott Hamilton Method)

**Equipment needed**:
- Threaded dowel from Home Depot with grip
- 2.5-pound dumbbell weight attached to end
- Creates a short, heavy training club

**Purpose**: The weight forces proper "up" motion and prevents early "in" movement

**Execution**:
1. Take club in lead hand only
2. Start with small forward press for momentum
3. Begin backswing with body turn
4. **Critical technical point**: Turn wrist bones over each other without over-flexing lead wrist
5. Weight of club prevents pulling across early
6. Club naturally "pitches up on plane" when done correctly

**Key feeling**: "Just the weight of it, you start to pitch the club up in front of you more this way without pulling everything across"

**Common error to avoid**: Making it an arm-only motion without honest body rotation—"which defeats the purpose of the whole drill"

**Success marker**: Club pitches up on plane nicely without conscious manipulation

### Drill 2: Frame Preservation Drill

**Setup**: Create awareness of arm position relative to chest

**Execution**:
1. Take address position
2. Note the "frame" (relationship between arms and torso)
3. Make backswing while maintaining that same frame/box until lead arm parallel
4. After lead arm parallel, allow arm to "fall across" if needed
5. At lead arm parallel checkpoint, physically pull hand to chest to verify position

**Key comparison feeling**:
- Feel the difference between correct position (hands forward of centerline) vs.
- Incorrect position (hands back behind centerline)

**Verification method**: "Put my hand on it—I go, okay, from my point of view, that's where I need to be, not back in here"

**Both drills accomplish the same goal**: Get "up early and in late" to create the sickle shape at top plus automatic shallowing on downswing

## Core Principles Summary

### The Physics of Shallowing

**Primary cause**: Proper backswing loading, not downswing manipulation
**Quote**: "To me, it's loading the backswing to allow the shallowing to occur automatic"

**Essential space**: Lower body must initiate downswing first—"you got to have some space there or it's going to throw it all off"

**Chain reaction**:
1. Up early + in late (backswing) →
2. Creates sickle at top →
3. Allows downward hand path start →
4. Body rotation adds to downward motion →
5. Automatic shallowing occurs →
6. Proper sequencing achieved

### Common Misconceptions Addressed

**Myth**: The swing moves across the body
**Reality**: The swing moves up and down, combined with rotation

**Myth**: Adding depth (moving hands in) early prevents slicing
**Reality**: Early depth forces late lift, creating laid-off position that produces over-the-top steepness

**Myth**: Arms get up from bending elbows
**Reality**: Elite players achieve lead arm parallel with "very little elbow bend in many cases"

**Myth**: You need to manually shallow the club in transition
**Reality**: Correct backswing sequencing creates automatic shallowing

**Myth**: Camera angle shows what's really happening
**Reality**: "It's a stationary camera with the body moving around. So it creates poor concepts."

### The Universal Application

**Individual differences acknowledged**: "We're all going to be shaped a little differently with shoulder width and arm length"

**Universal principle**: Regardless of body type, maintaining or slightly increasing the elbow-shoulder-C7 angle until lead arm parallel is crucial

**Anatomical reality**: Adult male golfers especially need this space due to broader shoulders, thicker chest, and body mass

## Action Steps

1. **Film yourself**: Down-the-line view, focus on lead arm parallel checkpoint
2. **Assess hand position**: Is your glove hand behind centerline at this point?
3. **Test with "pull in" method**: Do hands land at mid-chest?
4. **Choose a drill**: Try both the weighted one-handed and frame preservation drills
5. **Focus on feeling**: Notice the difference between "up early/in late" vs. old pattern
6. **Trust the process**: Understand that fixing the backswing automatically fixes the downswing

## Key Takeaways

1. **Timing is everything**: It's not about adding depth—it's about WHEN you add depth
2. **Up early, in late**: Elite players delay moving arms across until after lead arm reaches parallel
3. **Physics, not manipulation**: Proper backswing loading creates automatic shallowing without conscious effort
4. **The late flop problem**: Early depth → late lift → laid-off position → inevitable steepness
5. **Slack creates sequencing**: Leaving directional space allows proper hand path curve on downswing
6. **Rory McIlroy example**: Perfect demonstration of delayed depth creating the "sickle" and natural shallow
7. **Self-diagnosis available**: Use down-the-line video and "pull hands in" test to assess your pattern
8. **Two proven drills**: Weighted one-handed drill or frame preservation drill—both accomplish the goal
9. **Anatomical necessity**: Adult bodies require this space; can't compensate by going early across
10. **Loading creates shallowing**: The correct backswing automatically produces the correct downswing

## Final Note

This video represents a paradigm shift from "fixing the downswing" to "loading the backswing correctly." The instructors emphasize that this approach is "so much easier than you would think if you get the backswing right." Rather than adding compensatory moves to fix a steep downswing, golfers should address the root cause: mistimed depth in the backswing. The biomechanics are clear—delay the "in" movement, prioritize the "up" movement early, and the downswing takes care of itself through natural physics and proper sequencing.
