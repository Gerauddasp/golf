# Video 27: Fix Your Sway & Backswing Rotation FAST! (Make a Tour Level Pivot)

**YouTube ID**: i_mJli-aXi0
**Duration**: 7:00

## Overview

This video addresses one of the most common swing faults in golf: improper lateral movement (sway) during the backswing. Athletic Motion Golf presents biomechanical evidence showing that swaying occurs in two problematic directions - both away from and toward the target - with equal negative consequences. Using 3D motion capture data (GEARS), the instructors demonstrate that the solution isn't to overcorrect one extreme with another, but rather to execute proper pelvic rotation through internal hip rotation. The key insight: correct movements are physically easier to perform than compensatory patterns, making this accessible to golfers of all levels.

## Key Biomechanical Concepts

### The Two Types of Sway

**Traditional Sway (Away from Target)**
- Excessive lateral movement of pelvis away from target during backswing
- Results in inconsistent low point, loss of power
- Common in amateur golfers seeking width in backswing

**Reverse Sway (Toward Target)**
- Recently emerged trend from overcorrection of traditional sway
- Involves moving pelvis toward target in backswing
- Often caused by misinterpreting "keep trail hip back" instruction
- Creates contorted positions requiring hip to turn 90 degrees
- Leads to straightening of trail leg (biomechanically unsound)

**Scientific Principle**: Neither extreme produces optimal kinematic sequencing or energy transfer

### Upper Body-Lower Body Relationship

**Kinetic Chain Interaction**
- Lower body movements are influenced by upper body positions
- Excessive spine extension or tilt in backswing triggers compensatory hip movement
- This creates the "ringing the bell" motion (clapper moving inside bell)

**Key Point**: Everything in the golf swing is interrelated - you cannot fix lower body in isolation

### Proper Pelvic Movement: Internal Hip Rotation

**Biomechanical Definition**
- Internal rotation at the trail hip joint (not spinning the pelvis)
- Two movement options exist:
  1. Spinning the pelvis (incorrect)
  2. Internal rotation into trail hip doing work at actual joint (correct)

**The Belt Buckle Cue**
- Belt buckle moves from center of stance toward inside of trail ankle
- Trail leg maintains its address angle (angled slightly inward)
- Small amount of straightening acceptable in early takeaway due to weight shift
- By top of backswing, trail leg angle returns to address position

**3D Movement Parameters (GEARS Data)**
- Pelvis moves laterally approximately 0.5-1.5 inches (varies by individual hip width)
- Hip rotation approximately 45 degrees
- Hip joint moves back and in slightly
- Movement pattern: shift → rotate → recenter → through to target

## Common Misconceptions Addressed

### "This is a Pro Move" Fallacy

**Tough Love Reality Check**
- Proper pelvic rotation is EASIER physically than compensatory movements
- Swaying (either direction) or "ringing the bell" requires more muscular effort and flexibility
- The correct movement is simple: turn belt buckle toward inside of trail ankle while maintaining leg angle
- Any golfer can perform this movement regardless of flexibility

**Scientific Support**: Good movements are biomechanically efficient and require less physical effort than poor compensatory patterns

## Actionable Drills

### Plumb Bob Alignment Drill

**Purpose**: Train proper pelvic rotation while eliminating lateral sway

**Equipment Needed**:
- Alignment stick or club
- Second club to use as vertical reference (plumb bob)

**Setup**:
1. Place alignment stick on ground perpendicular to target line
2. Position stick at center of stance
3. Straddle alignment stick equally with feet
4. Hold club vertically against belt buckle as plumb bob reference

**Execution**:
1. Start with club vertical at center of stance (belt buckle)
2. Make backswing pivot, turning belt buckle toward trail leg
3. Club should move toward trail side but NOT move past the alignment stick
4. Partner can hold club against trail hip to provide tactile feedback
5. Pelvis rotates approximately 45 degrees
6. Trail leg maintains angle throughout

**Success Markers**:
- Club stays on trail side of alignment stick
- Belt buckle visibly turns toward inside of trail ankle
- Trail leg angle maintained (no excessive straightening)
- No forward movement of belt buckle (overturning)

**Progression**:
1. Perform drill with eyes open (5-10 reps)
2. Perform with eyes closed to enhance feel (5-10 reps)
3. Add upper body and arm movement
4. Add club and make practice swings
5. Progress to hitting balls with proper sensation

### Mirror/Video Feedback Drill

**Purpose**: Visual confirmation of proper hip rotation vs. sway

**Setup**:
- Position yourself perpendicular to mirror or camera
- Mark belt buckle position at address

**Key Checkpoints**:
1. **Address**: Belt buckle centered in stance (50/50 or 55/45 weight distribution)
2. **Mid-backswing**: Belt buckle moving right (for RH golfer), not forward or back
3. **Top of backswing**: Belt buckle at inside of trail ankle, trail leg angle preserved
4. **Avoid**: Belt buckle moving past trail hip (away from target sway)
5. **Avoid**: Belt buckle moving toward target (reverse sway)

## Key Technical Details

### Trail Leg Angle Maintenance

**Address Position**
- Trail leg has slight inward angle (knee kicked in slightly)
- This is natural athletic position

**During Takeaway**
- May straighten slightly as weight shifts into trail leg
- This is acceptable and natural

**Top of Backswing**
- Must return to address angle
- Indicates proper internal hip rotation occurred
- Prevents loss of stored energy

### Upper Body Considerations

**What Can Cause Compensatory Sway**:
- Excessive spine extension (leaning back)
- Excessive shoulder tilt (trying to get shoulder to ground)
- Keeping head too centered while trying to add speed

**Solution**: Coordinate upper and lower body movements properly - don't isolate fixes

## Key Takeaways

1. **Sway occurs in TWO directions** - both away from and toward target - and both are equally problematic
2. **Don't fix one extreme with another** - overcorrecting traditional sway by moving hip back toward target creates new problems
3. **Internal hip rotation is the solution** - turn belt buckle from center to inside of trail ankle while maintaining trail leg angle
4. **Proper movement is EASIER** - correct biomechanics require less effort and flexibility than compensatory patterns
5. **Upper and lower body are linked** - poor upper body movements will trigger compensatory lower body actions
6. **Expected movement: 0.5-1.5 inches lateral** with ~45 degrees rotation (individual variation based on anatomy)
7. **Progression is critical** - master drill without club → add arms → add club → hit balls
8. **This is NOT a "pro move"** - it's the most efficient movement pattern available to any golfer
9. **Use simple tools** - alignment stick and plumb bob (or club) are sufficient for mastery
10. **Build foundation first** - stacking good lower body movement with good upper body movement creates lasting swing changes

## Training Progression

**Week 1-2: Movement Pattern**
- 10 minutes daily with plumb bob drill
- Focus: belt buckle to inside of ankle, maintain leg angle
- Perform with eyes closed to enhance proprioception

**Week 3-4: Integration**
- Add upper body rotation
- Progress to slow-motion swings with club
- Use mirror/video for feedback

**Week 5-6: Application**
- Hit balls with drill sensation
- Reduce conscious thought, trust the movement
- Monitor for upper body compensation patterns

**Maintenance**
- Use as warm-up drill before practice/play
- Return to drill if sway patterns re-emerge

## AMG Philosophy Notes

**Avoiding Extremes**: The video emphasizes that golf instruction often creates problems by pushing golfers to extremes. The pendulum swings from one fault to an overcorrection, neither of which represents optimal biomechanics.

**Simplicity of Correct Movement**: A recurring theme in AMG content - proper movement patterns are mechanically simpler and require less physical effort than compensatory movements.

**Individual Variation**: While the 3D movement is 0.5-1.5 inches lateral, this varies based on individual hip width and anatomy. The feel (belt buckle to inside ankle) is universal.

**Foundation Building**: This drill represents a foundational movement. Once mastered, it allows proper stacking of upper body movements, arm action, and wrist mechanics for a complete, lasting swing change.
