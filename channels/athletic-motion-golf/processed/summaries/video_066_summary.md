## Overview

Athletic Motion Golf presents a diagnostic drill designed to identify and eliminate casting in the downswing. This checkpoint drill uses a "halfway-down stop" technique to evaluate critical sequencing and position elements at delivery. The drill reveals whether a golfer maintains proper wrist angles, arm connection, shaft plane, clubface orientation, and lower body rotation through the critical transition phase. This is a biomechanical evaluation tool that provides immediate feedback on downswing quality.

## Key Concepts

### The Halfway-Down Checkpoint Drill

- **No ball required** - Ball optional (acts as visual reference only)
- **Normal backswing speed** - Take club back at regular tempo
- **Semi-normal downswing** - Start down at near-normal speed
- **Halfway stop** - Put the brakes on when hands reach halfway down
- **Hold position** - Freeze and evaluate landing position

### Critical Position Checkpoints (Half-Way Down)

**Wrist Angles**
- Wrist angles should be **retained** from top of backswing
- No early release or straightening of lead wrist
- Trail wrist maintains flexion/extension

**Arm Connection**
- **Lead arm connected** to torso
- **Trail arm connected** to side
- Arms maintain relationship to body rotation

**Shaft Position**
- Shaft should be **pitched back**
- Shaft remains **on plane**
- Club has not passed hands (no flip)

**Clubface Orientation**
- Face position: **pretty much straight up and down**
- Not excessively closed or open
- Neutral face angle relative to shaft plane

### Lower Body Sequencing Markers

**Hip Rotation Priority**
- **Knees should be square** (facing target) before hands reach belt level
- Demonstrates proper lower body sequencing
- Hips lead, hands follow

**Weight Transfer**
- Weight should be predominantly on **left foot** (lead foot)
- Confirms proper pressure shift in downswing
- Ground force application pattern established

## Actionable Drills

### Anti-Casting Checkpoint Drill

**Purpose**: Diagnose casting, evaluate downswing sequence quality, develop feel for retained angles and proper delivery position

**Setup**:
- Normal address position with any club
- Ball optional (can be present as visual reference)
- Take normal grip

**Execution**:
1. Execute backswing at **normal speed**
2. Start downswing at **semi-normal speed** (slightly controlled)
3. When hands reach **halfway down** (approximately hip height), **immediately stop**
4. Hold the freeze position
5. Evaluate position against checkpoint criteria

**Success Markers**:
- ✓ Wrist angles retained (lead wrist flat or bowed, not cupped)
- ✓ Lead arm connected to chest
- ✓ Trail arm tucked to trail side
- ✓ Shaft pitched back (leaning toward target)
- ✓ Shaft on plane (not too steep or shallow)
- ✓ Clubface approximately vertical
- ✓ Knees rotated square to target (or past square)
- ✓ Hands still above belt level when knees square
- ✓ Weight predominantly on lead foot

**Common Failure Patterns**:
- ✗ Wrist angles lost (cupped lead wrist = casting)
- ✗ Trail arm disconnected (chicken wing pattern developing)
- ✗ Shaft ahead of hands (club has passed hands)
- ✗ Hips still open/behind (poor sequencing)
- ✗ Weight still on trail foot (no shift occurring)

**Training Tip**: Film the drill and post on social media tagging @AthleticMotionGolf for professional feedback on positions

## Key Takeaways

1. **Casting is diagnosed at halfway-down**, not at impact - the checkpoint reveals early release patterns before they manifest at the ball

2. **Lower body must lead** - Knees should be square before hands reach belt level, demonstrating proper kinematic sequence

3. **Six simultaneous checkpoints** - Wrist angles, lead arm connection, trail arm connection, shaft pitch/plane, face angle, and weight distribution must all be correct

4. **Video analysis recommended** - Recording and reviewing (or sharing for expert feedback) provides objective assessment of positions

5. **The drill tests sequencing, not just positions** - Dynamic execution at speed reveals whether proper movement patterns are ingrained or if compensations exist

## Related Concepts

- **Kinematic Sequence**: Lower body → torso → arms → club (this drill tests whether sequence is correct at halfway-down)
- **Lag Retention**: Maintaining wrist angles through delivery phase
- **Shaft Plane Control**: On-plane delivery vs. over-the-top or stuck patterns
- **Connection**: Arms maintaining proper relationship to body rotation

## AMG Scientific Principles

This drill embodies AMG's emphasis on **biomechanical checkpoints** and **sequencing analysis**. Rather than focusing on end-position (impact), the drill evaluates the critical halfway-down position where casting patterns become evident. The multi-checkpoint evaluation (wrists, arms, shaft, face, hips, weight) reflects AMG's systematic, data-driven approach to swing analysis. The invitation to film and tag for feedback demonstrates AMG's commitment to 3D analysis and objective position evaluation versus subjective "feel."
