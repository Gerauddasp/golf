# Video 35: Every PGA Tour Golfer Does THIS With Their Trail Arm in the Golf Swing!

**Duration**: 0:43

## Overview

This short video reveals a critical biomechanical pattern observed universally among PGA Tour professionals: the trail arm lowering sequence in transition. The video demonstrates how elite players lower their trail arm tricep to the rib cage during the downswing while maintaining the arm angle established at the top of the backswing. This movement pattern is essential for proper body rotation and optimal hand path placement through impact.

## Key Concepts

### Trail Arm Position at Address
- Trail arm starts in front of the body at setup
- This forward position establishes the baseline for the swing sequence

### Backswing Trail Arm Movement
- As the club swings up, the trail arm moves over slightly
- The movement path aligns approximately with the seam line of the shirt (center of torso)
- The arm lifts during the backswing to reach the top position

### The Critical Transition Move: Trail Arm Lowering
**Biomechanical Sequence:**
- **Immediately from the top**: Initiate lowering of the trail arm
- **Specific target**: Lower the bottom of the trail arm (tricep area) toward the rib cage
- **Critical constraint**: Maintain the elbow angle established at the top—do NOT narrow it
- **Purpose**: Creates the proper hand path while allowing full body rotation

**Functional Benefits:**
- Enables continued body rotation through impact
- Positions the hands in a "playable" location
- Maintains connection between arm and torso for power transfer
- Prevents early extension and loss of posture

### The Quantitative Relationship
**Key Metric**: "It lowers more in the downswing than it lifts in the backswing"
- The magnitude of lowering exceeds the magnitude of lifting
- This asymmetry emphasizes the critical importance of the lowering movement
- Suggests a greater range of vertical motion descending than ascending

## Actionable Drills

### Trail Arm Awareness Drill
**Purpose**: Develop kinesthetic awareness of trail arm tricep-to-rib-cage connection
**Setup**: Address position with club
**Execution**:
1. Start with trail arm in front of body
2. Swing to top of backswing, noting the arm position
3. Feel the elbow angle at the top
4. Initiate downswing by lowering trail arm tricep toward rib cage
5. Maintain the elbow angle—resist the urge to straighten or narrow
6. Focus on the lowering sensation being greater than the lifting sensation

**Success Markers**:
- Tricep makes contact or near-contact with rib cage early in downswing
- Elbow angle remains constant from top to delivery position
- Body can continue rotating freely without interference
- Hands arrive in front of body at impact

### Shirt Seam Reference Drill
**Purpose**: Visualize and track trail arm path during backswing
**Setup**: Wear a shirt with a visible center seam or shoulder seam
**Execution**:
1. Note the seam position at address
2. Make slow-motion backswings
3. Track trail arm elbow movement relative to the seam
4. Arm should swing "over" slightly, aligning with the seam line
5. Use this visual checkpoint to ensure consistent backswing plane

**Success Markers**:
- Trail arm elbow tracks consistently along seam line
- Movement feels "over" rather than "behind"
- Top position is repeatable

### Magnitude Comparison Drill
**Purpose**: Internalize the concept that lowering exceeds lifting
**Setup**: Practice swings without ball
**Execution**:
1. Make backswing and note the amount of trail arm lift
2. Rate the lift magnitude mentally (e.g., "5 inches")
3. Transition to downswing
4. Actively lower the tricep MORE than you lifted
5. Rate the lowering magnitude (should exceed lift measurement)
6. Repeat until the exaggerated lowering becomes automatic

**Success Markers**:
- Conscious awareness of greater lowering distance
- Trail arm feels more active in downswing than backswing
- Connection to rib cage is established early and maintained

## Key Takeaways

1. **Universal Pattern**: Every great professional golfer demonstrates this trail arm lowering sequence—it's not optional at elite levels

2. **Maintain the Angle**: The critical constraint is lowering the tricep to the rib cage WITHOUT narrowing the elbow angle established at the top

3. **Enables Rotation**: This movement pattern allows continued body rotation while keeping the hand path functional and "playable"

4. **Asymmetric Motion**: The trail arm lowers MORE in the downswing than it lifts in the backswing, emphasizing the importance of this downswing move

5. **Immediate Action**: The lowering begins "immediately out of the top"—this is a transition priority, not a mid-downswing correction

## Biomechanical Significance

This video highlights a fundamental movement pattern that distinguishes elite ball strikers from amateur golfers. The trail arm lowering sequence:
- Maintains proper swing plane through impact
- Preserves the power accumulator angles for late release
- Prevents premature casting or early extension
- Enables maximum rotational velocity through impact
- Creates a repeatable, centered contact pattern

The emphasis on maintaining elbow angle while lowering the arm reveals sophisticated motor control—the arm moves vertically toward the torso without collapsing the structure, creating both connection and stored energy for impact.
