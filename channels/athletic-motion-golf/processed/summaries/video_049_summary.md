## Overview

This short Athletic Motion Golf video reveals a critical lower body movement pattern used by elite golfers: the forward motion of the trail knee through impact. Rather than simply rotating the hips back, the best players allow their trail knee to move forward toward the target line, creating what AMG calls "space invasion" - where the trail knee travels into the space previously occupied by the lead knee. This forward knee motion is essential for achieving optimal pelvis rotation (45° open at impact) and controlling the overall pelvis motion through the ball.

## Key Concepts

### Trail Knee Motion Controls Pelvis Rotation
- Overall pelvis motion is largely controlled by knee bending motion and the direction the knee travels
- It's not just about moving the trail hip back - that's only part of the equation
- The trail knee must move FORWARD through impact
- This forward motion occurs around the center of the pelvis

### The "Space Invader" Concept
- Every joint in the body has its own swing plane or motion path
- The trail knee has its own "swing plane" that travels toward the ball and around
- Elite players allow a point on the outside of the trail knee to travel forward toward the target line
- The trail knee eventually lines up with the lead knee through impact
- This is described as the knee "invading the space" of the lead side

### Achieving 45° Pelvis Rotation at Impact
- To achieve optimal pelvis position (45° open at impact), the trail knee must move forward
- It's very difficult to achieve proper rotation if you keep the trail heel planted on the ground
- Keeping the entire trail leg back away from the target line restricts pelvis rotation
- The heel must release and the knee must travel forward for proper rotation

## Biomechanical Insights

### Joint-Specific Swing Planes
**Concept**: Each joint has its own plane of motion
**Trail Knee Path**:
- Starts behind the target line at address
- Travels forward toward the ball during downswing
- Moves "out and around" through impact zone
- Lines up with lead knee at impact
**Pelvis Interaction**: The knee motion drives rotation around the pelvis center point

### Heel Release Necessity
**Problem**: Keeping trail heel planted restricts proper motion
**Solution**: Trail heel must release from ground to allow forward knee travel
**Result**: Enables full pelvis rotation and proper impact position

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Keeping Trail Leg "Back"**: Thinking hip rotation is only about moving the trail hip backward
2. **Planted Trail Heel**: Keeping the heel glued to the ground through impact restricts knee motion
3. **Static Trail Side**: Not allowing the trail knee to travel forward toward the target line
4. **Ignoring Joint-Specific Planes**: Thinking of the body as one solid rotating unit rather than multiple joints with their own motion paths

## Key Takeaways

1. **Trail knee must move FORWARD through impact, not just rotate back** - this is essential for proper pelvis rotation
2. **Think of "space invasion"** - the trail knee should invade the space of the lead side, eventually lining up with the lead knee
3. **Every joint has its own swing plane** - the trail knee has a distinct forward and around motion path
4. **To achieve 45° open pelvis at impact, the trail heel must release** and allow the knee to travel forward
5. **Pelvis rotation happens around the center point** - it's a combination of the lead hip moving back AND the trail knee moving forward

## Skill Level

**Intermediate to Advanced**: This concept requires awareness of lower body sequencing and the ability to feel individual joint movements during the swing.

## Related Concepts

- Lower body sequencing in the downswing
- Pelvis rotation mechanics
- Ground force interaction and heel release
- Hip turn vs. hip rotation distinction
- Weight transfer and pressure mapping

## Practice Application

While this video doesn't include specific drills, golfers can apply this concept by:
1. Feeling the trail knee move forward (not just rotating) through impact
2. Allowing the trail heel to release naturally from the ground
3. Visualizing the knee traveling on its own "swing plane" toward and around the ball
4. Checking that the trail knee lines up with or moves past the lead knee at impact
5. Using video analysis to verify the forward knee motion is occurring
