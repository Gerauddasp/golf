## Overview

This short instructional segment addresses the common compensatory movement of "standing up" or "early extension" during the downswing. AMG coaches explain that standing up is not a swing fault to be directly corrected, but rather a symptom of deeper mechanical issues. The body lifts to avoid catastrophic contact with the ground, making it a protective compensation rather than a primary problem. Understanding the root causes is essential for proper correction.

## Key Concepts

### Standing Up is a Compensation, Not the Root Cause
- **The Illusion**: Players and coaches often focus on head lift, but this is misleading
- **The Reality**: The entire body lifts to prevent the club from crashing into the ground
- **Critical Understanding**: You cannot simply "stay down" without addressing what's forcing you to stand up
- **Protective Mechanism**: The body is preventing injury or fat contact by lifting

### Three Primary Root Causes

#### 1. Overly Steep Club Path
- **Mechanics**: Club comes "out of the top" on too steep an angle
- **Consequence**: Without standing up, the club would crash into the ground behind the ball
- **Compensation**: Player pops up and shallows the club to avoid digging
- **Key Phrase**: "Two shallows" - standing up AND throwing/shallowing the club

#### 2. Weight Too Far Back
- **Mechanics**: Center of mass remains behind the ball in transition
- **Consequence**: Steep angle of attack from hanging back
- **Compensation**: Player pops up and flicks at the ball
- **Result**: Weak, scooped contact instead of ball-first compression

#### 3. Club Path Too Far Underneath (Inside)
- **Mechanics**: Club drops excessively inside in transition
- **Consequence**: Path would crash into ground from inside
- **Compensation**: Standing up to create space for the club to exit
- **Ball Flight**: Typically produces pushes or hooks

### The Head Lift Illusion
- **What People See**: Head moving upward through impact
- **What's Actually Happening**: Entire body structure lifting and extending
- **Focus Error**: Trying to keep the head down doesn't address mechanical causes
- **Better Metric**: Monitor body angles (spine, hips) rather than head position alone

### Impact Position Extremes
- **Problem Golfer**: Upper body nearly vertical at impact from excessive standing
- **Overcorrection Risk**: Some players try so hard not to stand up they squat excessively
- **Overcorrection Pattern**: "Both hips back" with extreme spine tilt
- **Why It Happens**: Players see themselves lifting on video and overcompensate

## Biomechanical Analysis

### Why the Body Must Lift

**Scenario 1 - Steep Path:**
- Steep downswing plane → Ground contact before ball
- Body lifts → Creates clearance
- Club shallows → Allows for contact

**Scenario 2 - Weight Back:**
- Hanging back → Ascending angle of attack
- Body lifts → Compensates for poor weight shift
- Arms flip → Attempt to reach ball

**Scenario 3 - Too Inside:**
- Excessively inside path → No room for club to exit
- Body lifts → Creates space
- Club pushes out → Produces block or hook

### The Correction Paradox
- **Wrong Approach**: "Keep your head down" or "stay in your posture"
- **Why It Fails**: Doesn't address why you're standing up
- **Correct Approach**: Fix the club path, weight shift, or transition mechanics
- **Result**: Standing up naturally reduces when root cause is eliminated

## Actionable Corrections

### For Steep Club (Cause #1)

**Diagnosis:**
- Divots are deep and/or too far behind ball
- Feel like you're "chopping" at it
- Ball flight starts left (right-handers)

**Fix Priority:**
1. Shallow the transition (drop club more inside from top)
2. Improve shoulder turn/tilt relationship
3. Allow trail arm to work more around body vs. straight down

**Success Marker**: Club approaches ball on shallower angle, less need to stand up

### For Weight Too Far Back (Cause #2)

**Diagnosis:**
- Divots after ball are minimal or absent
- Contact feels thin or "flippy"
- Weight feels on trail foot at impact

**Fix Priority:**
1. Improve weight shift in transition (pressure forward earlier)
2. Keep center of mass moving toward target
3. Eliminate hanging back tendency

**Success Marker**: Ball-first contact, forward shaft lean, pressure on lead side

### For Too Far Underneath (Cause #3)

**Diagnosis:**
- Club feels "stuck behind" in downswing
- Pushes or snap hooks are common
- Club path is significantly in-to-out

**Fix Priority:**
1. Steepen early downswing slightly
2. Improve transition sequencing
3. Keep club more in front of body

**Success Marker**: More neutral path, better face-to-path relationship

## Key Takeaways

1. **Standing up is a symptom, not a disease** - Your body is protecting you from poor mechanics underneath
2. **Three main causes**: Steep club, weight back, or club too inside - diagnose which applies to you
3. **Head lift is an illusion** - Focus on full body extension, not just head position
4. **Don't overcorrect** - Trying to "stay down" without fixing root causes creates new problems
5. **Fix the cause, not the symptom** - Address club path, weight shift, or transition mechanics directly

## Diagnostic Questions

Ask yourself:
1. Where are my divots? (Deep and early = steep; absent = hanging back; shallow and in-to-out = too inside)
2. What's my typical miss? (Pulls/slices = steep; thin/chunk = hanging back; pushes/hooks = too inside)
3. Where's my weight at impact? (Forward = good; back = hanging back issue)
4. What does my club path feel like? (Straight down = steep; around and under = too inside)
