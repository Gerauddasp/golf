## Overview

This short instructional video demonstrates the "Hanger Drill," a biomechanical training aid designed to improve clubface control through impact and address both slice and hook tendencies. The drill utilizes a specially modified coat hanger that provides tactile feedback about wrist angles and forearm rotation throughout the swing sequence. The training aid featured includes a BB pellet that provides additional auditory and kinesthetic feedback for proper shaft loading and release timing.

## Key Concepts

### The Hanger Training Aid Setup

- **Address Position**: At setup, the hanger is positioned off the left forearm with the club in an "uncocked" position
- **Proper Contact Point**: The hook portion of the hanger rests against the lead (left) forearm
- **Initial Feedback**: This creates a reference point for proper wrist angle maintenance through the backswing

### Dual Feedback Mechanism (Two-for-One Drill)

- **Hanger Component**: Provides tactile feedback about forearm/club relationship
- **BB Pellet Component**: The training club contains a floating BB pellet that moves within the shaft
- **Coordinated Feedback**: Both elements work simultaneously to reinforce proper sequencing and release mechanics

### Backswing Phase Mechanics

- **Hanger Stability**: During the backswing, the hanger maintains contact with the left forearm
- **Wrist Angle Maintenance**: Consistent pressure indicates proper wrist cock and clubface orientation
- **Visual Reference**: The instructor emphasizes the hanger staying in contact throughout the backswing motion

### Downswing Transition and Release

- **BB Pellet Action**: On the downswing, the BB should "float into the grip" and then "shoot" toward the target
- **Critical Timing**: The BB release simulates proper shaft loading and lag release through impact
- **Maintaining Pressure**: Despite the natural release, maintain "a little bit of pressure" on the hanger through the hitting zone
- **Forearm Rotation**: The drill encourages natural forearm rotation rather than excessive hand manipulation

### Post-Impact and Follow-Through

- **Hanger Transfer**: The hanger transitions from the left forearm to contact with the right forearm after impact
- **Right Forearm Contact**: At the finish position, the hanger's hook portion should be "behind" the right forearm
- **Natural Uncocking**: The wrist uncocks naturally through this transition without forced manipulation

## Actionable Drills

### Complete Hanger Drill with BB Feedback

**Purpose**: Develop proper wrist angles, forearm rotation, and release timing to eliminate slice or hook patterns

**Setup**:
- Use a modified coat hanger attached to a training club with BB pellet
- Address position with hanger resting against left forearm
- Club in slightly uncocked position
- Feel initial pressure point on forearm

**Execution**:
1. **Backswing**: Swing back while maintaining hanger contact on left forearm
2. **Listen**: The BB pellet should remain quiet or float gently toward the grip
3. **Transition**: At top of backswing, initiate downswing maintaining slight hanger pressure
4. **Release Phase**: Allow BB to "shoot" toward target while preserving forearm contact with hanger
5. **Impact Zone**: Maintain subtle pressure despite the natural release occurring
6. **Follow-Through**: Feel hanger transfer from left to right forearm
7. **Finish**: Check that hanger hook is now behind right forearm at completion

**Success Markers**:
- Hanger stays in contact with lead forearm throughout backswing
- BB provides clear auditory feedback of proper loading and release
- No forced "flipping" motion with hands
- Natural body rotation and forearm rotation (not isolated hand manipulation)
- Smooth transfer of hanger from left to right forearm post-impact
- Consistent ball flight pattern improvement (straighter shots)

**Common Errors to Avoid**:
- Forcing the hanger to stay on with excessive grip pressure
- Holding the club rigidly to prevent natural uncocking
- Isolating hand/wrist action instead of allowing body turn and forearm rotation
- Losing hanger contact too early in backswing (indicates improper wrist angles)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Dual Feedback System**: The hanger drill with BB pellet provides both tactile (hanger contact) and auditory (BB movement) feedback for proper swing mechanics

2. **Natural Release Mechanics**: The drill teaches proper release through natural body rotation and forearm rotation, not forced hand manipulation

3. **Wrist Angle Control**: Maintaining hanger contact on the lead forearm through the backswing ensures proper wrist cock and clubface control

4. **Pressure Without Force**: Maintain light pressure on the hanger through impact while allowing natural uncocking and release to occur

5. **Biomechanical Sequencing**: The BB pellet movement mirrors proper lag creation, load timing, and release sequence through the hitting zone

6. **Eliminates Compensations**: By preventing excessive hand manipulation ("doing this motion"), the drill removes common slice/hook compensations

## Scientific Principles

- **Kinematic Sequence**: The drill reinforces proper energy transfer from body rotation through forearms to club
- **Proprioceptive Feedback**: Tactile cues create body awareness of proper positions without visual monitoring
- **Auditory Learning**: BB movement provides real-time feedback about shaft loading and release timing
- **Natural Uncocking**: Allows centrifugal force and proper sequencing rather than early release or holding patterns

## Equipment Notes

- Requires specialized hanger training aid with attached coat hanger
- Training club must include BB pellet mechanism for full dual-feedback benefit
- Can be adapted with standard coat hanger and any club for basic forearm feedback drill (without BB component)
