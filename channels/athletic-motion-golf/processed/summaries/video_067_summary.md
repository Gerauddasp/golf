## Overview

This short instructional video presents a simple yet highly effective drill for eliminating topped fairway wood shots. The instructor demonstrates the "tee clipping drill," which trains golfers to achieve the optimal shallow angle of attack required for consistent fairway wood contact. The drill focuses on creating a sweeping motion with zero (or near-zero) angle of attack, which maximizes face contact quality and launch conditions. The video also addresses common swing errors—attempting to help the ball up or hitting down too steeply—that lead to poor fairway wood performance.

## Key Concepts

### Optimal Angle of Attack for Fairway Woods
- **Target**: Zero (or near-zero) angle of attack—a "sweeping" motion
- **Biomechanical rationale**: Fairway woods have large, shallow clubheads designed to glide along the turf rather than dig into it
- **Contact optimization**: A shallow approach maximizes center-face contact and proper launch angle
- **Physics principle**: Unlike irons (which benefit from slight downward strike), fairway woods perform best when the clubhead travels parallel to the ground through impact

### The Tee Clipping Drill
- **Setup**: Place a golf tee on the ground (not teed up) on the practice range or mat
- **Objective**: Sweep the clubhead along the ground to cleanly remove the tee without taking excessive divot or topping
- **Kinesthetic feedback**: Successfully clipping the tee provides immediate sensory confirmation of proper shallow attack angle
- **Skill transfer**: Once the feel is mastered with the tee, replicate the exact same motion with a golf ball

### Common Fairway Wood Errors to Avoid
- **"Helping it up"**: Attempting to lift or scoop the ball into the air creates an ascending angle of attack and leads to thin/topped contact
- **Excessive downward strike**: Treating fairway woods like irons results in steep angle of attack, heavy divots, and inconsistent contact
- **Mental model correction**: Trust the club's loft to create launch—your job is to sweep through the ball, not manipulate trajectory

### Equipment Trend Insight
- **Tour adoption**: Professional golfers increasingly replace long irons (2-4 iron) with fairway woods and hybrids
- **Ease of use**: Fairway woods offer larger sweet spots, higher launch, and more forgiveness than long irons
- **Practical recommendation**: Amateur golfers should prioritize fairway woods over long irons for improved consistency

## Actionable Drills

### Tee Clipping Drill (Primary)

**Purpose**: Train shallow angle of attack and eliminate topped fairway wood shots

**Equipment Needed**:
- Fairway wood (3-wood, 5-wood, or 7-wood)
- Standard golf tees
- Practice facility with grass or quality mats

**Setup**:
1. Place a golf tee flat on the ground (lying horizontally, not teed up)
2. Position the tee where you would normally place a golf ball
3. Take your standard fairway wood address position
4. Focus on the tee as your target

**Execution**:
1. Make a full swing with emphasis on width—keep the club head low and wide through the hitting zone
2. Attempt to sweep the tee cleanly off the turf without taking a divot
3. Feel the clubhead "brushing" the ground rather than digging or lifting
4. Maintain balance and tempo throughout the swing
5. Repeat 10-15 times until you consistently clip the tee

**Success Markers**:
- The tee flies forward cleanly without significant turf disruption
- Minimal or no divot after the tee
- Clubhead feels like it's "skating" along the ground through impact
- Consistent contact sensation in the center of the clubface
- Smooth, balanced finish position

**Progression**:
1. **Phase 1**: Clip tees without a ball (5-10 repetitions)
2. **Phase 2**: Place a ball immediately behind the tee and try to clip both (5-10 repetitions)
3. **Phase 3**: Remove the tee and visualize it's still there while hitting balls (10-15 shots)
4. **Phase 4**: Transfer the feel to on-course situations

### Mental Rehearsal Drill (Supplementary)

**Purpose**: Reinforce proper fairway wood motion through visualization

**Execution**:
1. Before each fairway wood shot, take a practice swing visualizing a tee on the ground
2. Feel the club sweeping the imaginary tee away
3. Carry that exact sensation into your actual shot
4. Use the internal cue: "Sweep the tee" as your swing thought

**Success Markers**:
- Pre-shot routine becomes automatic
- Reduced conscious manipulation during the swing
- Improved confidence with fairway woods

## Key Takeaways

1. **Zero angle of attack is optimal for fairway woods**—create a sweeping motion rather than hitting down or up
2. **The tee clipping drill provides instant feedback**—if you can consistently clip a tee off the ground, you have the correct shallow attack angle
3. **Make a wide swing**—keeping the clubhead low and wide through the hitting zone is essential for the sweeping motion
4. **Avoid two common errors**: Don't try to help the ball up (creates topped shots) and don't hit down steeply (creates heavy contact)
5. **Trust the loft**—the club is designed to launch the ball; your job is simply to sweep through with proper mechanics
6. **Replace long irons with fairway woods**—even tour professionals are making this switch due to improved consistency and ease of use
7. **Visualize the tee on every shot**—after practicing the drill, use the mental image of sweeping a tee to guide your fairway wood swing

## Applied Biomechanics Notes

### Angle of Attack Implications
- **Positive AoA** (upward strike): Can work with driver but creates inconsistent contact with fairway woods due to changing loft at impact
- **Negative AoA** (downward strike): Appropriate for irons but problematic for fairway woods, which have wider soles that bounce off turf
- **Zero AoA** (level strike): Optimal for fairway woods—maximizes face contact consistency and utilizes the club's designed loft

### Swing Width and Shallow Path
- **Wide arc**: Promotes shallow bottom of swing arc, critical for fairway wood success
- **Narrow/steep arc**: Creates excessive downward angle, leading to heavy or thin contact
- **Practical cue**: "Sweep it" encourages proper width and shallow path

### Perceptual-Motor Learning
- The tee clipping drill leverages **immediate sensory feedback** (visual + tactile) to accelerate motor learning
- **Transfer of learning**: The specific task (clipping tee) directly transfers to the target task (striking ball with shallow AoA)
