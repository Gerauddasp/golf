## Overview

This case study examines a pre-Masters GEARS session with PGA Tour player Sam Burns, revealing how subtle setup position errors create compensatory swing patterns. Using 3D motion capture data, AMG identified that an open, left-twisted body position with elevated trail forearm alignment caused Burns' club to start outside, resulting in a laid-off top position and steep downswing plane. The correction focused exclusively on setup fundamentals: squaring hips and shoulders while leveling forearm alignment, which immediately restored his natural shallow downswing pattern.

## Key Biomechanical Findings

### Setup Position Analysis (GEARS 3D Data)

**Problem Identified:**
- Body twisted open (left) at address
- Hips and shoulders aligned left of target
- Trail forearm elevated relative to lead forearm
- Created asymmetric upper body alignment

**Kinematic Chain Reaction:**
1. **Takeaway Phase**: Elevated trail forearm → club starts outside ideal plane
2. **Backswing**: Outside takeaway → compensatory "flop" to laid-off top position
3. **Transition**: Laid-off position → limits ability to shallow in transition
4. **Downswing**: Steep club path → inconsistent contact and reduced compression

### Setup Correction Protocol

**Alignment Adjustments:**
- **Hips**: Squared to target line (parallel alignment)
- **Shoulders**: Squared to match hip alignment
- **Forearms**: Leveled to eliminate elevation in trail side
- **Body Rotation**: Neutral position (no pre-twist left)

**Immediate Results:**
- Club swung back more on plane
- Top position less laid off
- Natural shallow transition restored
- Improved ability to rotate through impact
- Increased shot quality and consistency

## Practical Application

### Setup Position Checkpoint System

**Before Each Swing:**

1. **Hip Alignment Check**
   - Place alignment stick across hip bones
   - Verify parallel to target line
   - Avoid pre-rotation left

2. **Shoulder Alignment Check**
   - Check shoulder line matches hip line
   - Maintain square relationship
   - Prevent open upper body

3. **Forearm Relationship Check**
   - Both forearms at similar height
   - No elevation in trail forearm
   - Create symmetric arm hang

4. **Overall Body Position**
   - Neutral spine position
   - Weight balanced
   - No twist or pre-turn

### Diagnostic Protocol

**If Experiencing Steep Downswing:**

1. **Check Setup First**
   - Video yourself from down-the-line
   - Assess hip/shoulder alignment
   - Evaluate forearm positions

2. **Common Setup Errors**
   - Open (left-aimed) body alignment
   - Elevated trail shoulder/forearm
   - Pre-rotated hips
   - Asymmetric posture

3. **Correction Sequence**
   - Square hips and shoulders FIRST
   - Level forearms SECOND
   - Allow natural swing plane to return

### Mirror/Video Work

**Setup Training Drill:**
- Set up to ball with alignment sticks
- Check body squares from face-on view
- Verify forearm levelness
- Take video to confirm positions
- Repeat until positions feel natural

## Key Takeaways

1. **Setup Dominates Swing Plane**: Even elite players' swing compensations often trace back to simple setup misalignments
2. **Forearm Alignment Critical**: Trail forearm elevation promotes outside takeaway and subsequent compensations
3. **Body Alignment Chain**: Open hips/shoulders create systematic plane errors throughout the swing
4. **Correction Simplicity**: Squaring setup allows natural swing mechanics to return without swing thought manipulation
5. **GEARS Value**: 3D motion capture reveals subtle setup errors invisible to naked eye or 2D video
6. **Pre-Competition Protocol**: Even tour players benefit from setup verification sessions before major events

## AMG Scientific Principles Applied

**3D Motion Analysis**: GEARS technology quantified exact body positions and their effect on club path
**Kinematic Sequencing**: Traced how setup errors propagate through entire swing sequence
**Biomechanical Efficiency**: Squared setup reduces compensatory movements and allows natural sequencing
**Root Cause Analysis**: Identified setup as primary cause rather than treating downswing symptoms
**Evidence-Based Correction**: Used objective data to guide minimal effective intervention
