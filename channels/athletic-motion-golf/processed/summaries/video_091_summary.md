## Overview

Based on analysis of over 1.1 million swings through the Swing Coach app, the #1 swing fault among golfers is **hands too deep at the top of the backswing** - getting the hands too far behind the body. While depth is essential for a good golf swing (it allows you to shallow the club and turn better), the critical issue is HOW you achieve that depth. Most golfers chase excessive depth at the expense of maintaining their spine angle, which negates all the benefits of depth and creates a steepening move in the downswing. This video explains the biomechanical reality of proper hand depth, why it varies based on individual flexibility and body dimensions, and provides practical drills to find YOUR optimal depth while maintaining critical body angles.

## Key Concepts

### The #1 Fault: Excessive Hand Depth

- **The Problem**: Hands too deep (too far behind the body) at the top of the backswing
- **Root Cause**: Chasing depth trends without respecting individual body limitations
- **The Trade-Off**: Golfers achieve extra depth by standing up and losing spine angle
- **The Paradox**: Pursuing depth to help shallow the club actually steepens it when you lose posture
- **Data Source**: Over 1,112,949 swings analyzed via Swing Coach app

### Individual Depth Ranges: The Rory McIlroy Trap

- **Elite Player Reality**: Rory McIlroy has ~130 degrees of shoulder rotation
- **Average Golfer Reality**: Many golfers have 70-90 degrees of shoulder rotation
- **Older Golfer Reality**: May have only ~70 degrees due to reduced flexibility
- **The Mistake**: Trying to copy Rory's hand depth requires coming out of posture
- **Key Principle**: Everyone has a depth that's right for THEIR body

### Optimal Hand Depth Position (Down-the-Line View)

- **Setup Reference**: Hands start a couple inches in front of toes at address
- **Target Zone**: Hands should travel from "just in front of toes" to "around ankle level"
- **General Range**: Between midfoot and heel is acceptable for most golfers
- **Critical Measurement**: Hand position relative to feet, NOT relative to elite players

### The Depth vs. Spine Angle Relationship

- **Fundamental Rule**: Depth means nothing if you lose spine angle to get it
- **The Problem Chain**:
  1. Golfer flattens spine to get hands deeper
  2. Loss of posture in backswing
  3. Must rebend forward in downswing to reach the ball
  4. That momentum flips club over the plane
  5. Creates a whole new set of problems
- **The Solution**: Monitor BOTH parameters simultaneously

### Body Dimension Variables

- **Arm Length**: Longer arms naturally create more depth with same rotation
- **Shoulder Width**: Narrow shoulders allow more depth
- **Chest Thickness**: Thinner chest allows hands to travel farther back
- **Flexibility**: Greater shoulder rotation enables more natural depth
- **Age Factor**: Flexibility decreases with age, reducing natural depth range
- **Junior Build**: "Gumby" thin builds can get deep without much turn; most adults cannot

## Actionable Drills

### Drill 1: Turn-in-the-Box (Torso Rotation Awareness)

**Purpose**: Learn to rotate inside your spine angle without losing posture

**Setup**:
- Take normal golf setup position
- Hold club shaft horizontally across chest/shoulders
- Visualize two lines: one down your back, one down your front
- Your torso exists in this "box"

**Execution**:
1. Turn shoulders while staying inside the box
2. Don't come out of the box (stand up)
3. Don't dip below the box (excessive side bend)
4. Butt of club should point OUTSIDE the ball, not AT the ball
5. Head stays relatively still
6. Shoulder rotates across

**Success Markers**:
- Shoulder turns fully without standing up
- Butt of club points outside ball line
- Head position remains stable
- No sensation of "lifting up" or "flattening"

**Key Feel**: "I'm just turning this way" - pure rotation without manipulation

### Drill 2: Club-on-Shoulder Lift (Find Your Natural Depth)

**Purpose**: Discover the right amount of depth for YOUR body build

**Setup**:
- Take golf posture
- Flip club up onto your lead shoulder
- Make your normal body turn (90 degrees for average golfer)

**Execution**:
1. Turn shoulders to your maximum comfortable rotation
2. Keep spine angle constant
3. Lift lead arm up and away from body
4. Stop when lead arm is level to the ground
5. Note where hands end up - that's YOUR depth

**Success Markers**:
- Lead arm level with ground
- Spine angle maintained from setup
- No sensation of reaching or forcing
- Natural space under trail arm

**Individual Variations**:
- Longer arms = naturally deeper position
- Thinner build = can get deeper easily
- Limited flexibility = less depth is CORRECT
- Older golfer = accept shallower depth

### Drill 3: Swing Coach App Parameters (Technology-Assisted Training)

**Purpose**: Use objective feedback to dial in the depth/spine relationship

**Setup**:
- Download Swing Coach app (currently iOS only, Android coming)
- Select TWO parameters to monitor simultaneously:
  1. Hand Path at Top
  2. Spine Angle at Top

**Execution**:
1. Record swing down-the-line view
2. App analyzes both hand depth AND spine maintenance
3. If spine stays good but hands are "one behind" or "two behind" target: ACCEPTABLE
4. If hands are in zone but spine is lost: PROBLEM
5. If both are in green/yellow: OPTIMAL for your body

**Success Markers**:
- Spine angle stays in green zone
- Hand depth somewhere between midfoot and heel
- Both parameters good simultaneously
- NOT getting one at expense of the other

**App Features**:
- Free trial available (link in video description)
- Select multiple parameters to monitor
- Real-time feedback on swing positions
- Helps identify personal optimal ranges

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Chasing Depth Trends
**The Error**: "I need to get deep" without considering body limitations
**Why It Fails**: Requires standing up if you lack flexibility
**The Fix**: Find YOUR depth based on YOUR rotation capability

### Mistake 2: Copying Elite Players
**The Error**: Trying to match Rory's hand depth when you have 60 degrees less shoulder turn
**Why It Fails**: Physically impossible without losing posture
**The Fix**: Respect your body's natural ranges and dimensions

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Spine Angle Loss
**The Error**: Getting hands deep while standing up out of posture
**Why It Fails**: Negates all benefits of depth; causes steepening in transition
**The Fix**: Monitor spine angle and hand depth together, not separately

### Mistake 4: Overthinking the Pivot
**The Error**: "I need to side bend, then tilt, then shift, then rotate..."
**Why It Fails**: Creates complexity and tension
**The Fix**: Simple thought: "Turn in the box"

### Mistake 5: Excessive Shoulder Flattening
**The Error**: Deliberately flattening shoulders to get hands way behind
**Why It Fails**: Destroys the rotational efficiency of the pivot
**The Fix**: Maintain natural shoulder tilt; let depth come from rotation + arm lift

## Scientific Principles (AMG Style)

### Biomechanical Reality of Depth
- Depth is a RESULT of proper rotation, not a position to manipulate into
- Shoulder rotation capacity is largely fixed by age and anatomy
- Forcing positions beyond your physical range creates compensations
- Compensations in backswing require counter-compensations in downswing

### The Depth Paradox
- **Intended benefit**: Depth should help shallow the club
- **Actual result**: If achieved by losing posture, it steepens the club
- **Why**: Loss of forward bend requires re-bending in downswing
- **Effect**: Re-bending momentum flips club over plane

### Individual Variation Factors
1. **Shoulder rotation range**: Varies 70-130+ degrees between individuals
2. **Arm length**: Longer arms = more depth with same rotation
3. **Thoracic spine mobility**: Determines how much you can turn
4. **Hip mobility**: Affects ability to maintain lower body stability
5. **Age-related stiffness**: Progressively reduces available range

### The Minimum Effective Depth
- Hands between midfoot and heel = sufficient depth for good golf
- Going deeper only helps if you maintain angles
- Chasing depth beyond your capability creates more problems than benefits
- Better to have less depth with good angles than more depth with poor angles

## Key Takeaways

1. **The #1 swing fault is hands too deep at top** - the most common issue found in over 1.1 million analyzed swings

2. **Depth quality matters more than depth quantity** - HOW you create depth is more important than how much depth you have

3. **Individual ranges are reality** - your optimal depth depends on YOUR flexibility, body dimensions, and age - not what elite players do

4. **The spine angle relationship is critical** - depth at the expense of spine angle creates steepening, not shallowing

5. **Simple training works best** - "turn in the box" beats complex multi-step thoughts about side bend, tilt, and shift

6. **Use objective feedback** - The Swing Coach app lets you monitor both spine angle AND hand depth simultaneously to find your optimal combination

7. **Respect your body's limitations** - 70 degrees of shoulder rotation gets you to YOUR optimal depth; trying for Rory's depth with Rory's 130 degrees is impossible without compensation

8. **Between midfoot and heel is the target zone** - hands traveling from "front of toes" to "around ankle level" at top provides sufficient depth for good golf
