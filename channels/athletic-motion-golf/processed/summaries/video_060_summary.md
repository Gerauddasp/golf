# Video 60: Why "Anchoring" Your Trail Leg is a Golf Swing Killer

## Overview

This short video addresses a common overcorrection in golf instruction: "anchoring" the trail leg. Many golfers, after being told to avoid excessive lateral movement of the trail hip/knee toward the ball, overcorrect by restricting all movement and trying to keep the trail leg completely behind its address position. AMG explains why this anchoring is problematic and emphasizes the need for proper calibration rather than elimination of movement.

## Key Concepts

### The Trail Leg Anchoring Problem

**What It Is:**
- Golfers attempting to keep the trail knee and hip completely behind where they start at address
- Complete restriction of any forward (toward target) movement of the trail leg during the swing
- An overcorrection to the fault of excessive trail hip slide

**Why Golfers Do This:**
- Reaction to being taught that trail hip moving "way out there" toward the ball is a fault
- Misunderstanding that the solution is complete restriction rather than proper calibration
- Fear of the opposite extreme (excessive lateral movement)

### The "Curb Rash" Analogy

**The Problem:**
- If you're used to "curb rashing your tires on your left side" (excessive movement in one direction)
- The fix isn't to "curb rash the right side" (excessive restriction in the opposite direction)
- **The actual fix:** Learn to properly gauge how far you're coming into the space

**Application to Golf:**
- Excessive trail leg movement toward ball = one extreme
- Complete anchoring/restriction = opposite extreme
- Proper movement calibration = the goal

### Biomechanical Rationale

**Why Anchoring Doesn't Work:**
- Natural weight transfer requires some trail leg movement
- Complete restriction prevents proper sequencing
- Creates compensations elsewhere in the swing
- Limits power generation and efficiency

**What Should Happen:**
- Controlled, calibrated movement of trail leg
- Movement is allowed but not excessive
- Trail knee/hip can move forward within optimal range
- Balance between stability and mobility

## Key Takeaways

1. **Anchoring the trail leg** (keeping it completely behind address position) is a swing killer and common overcorrection
2. **Excessive trail leg movement** toward the ball is a legitimate fault, but the fix isn't complete restriction
3. **The solution is calibration** - learning to properly gauge the optimal amount of trail leg movement, not eliminating it
4. **Think "curb rash" analogy** - going too far in either direction is problematic; proper spatial awareness is the goal
5. **Avoid binary thinking** - golf swing fixes rarely involve going from one extreme to the complete opposite

- Weight transfer mechanics
- Pressure shift patterns
- Lower body sequencing
- Common overcorrections in golf instruction

## Coaching Philosophy

This video exemplifies AMG's approach to instruction:
- **Avoid extremes**: Most swing faults aren't fixed by doing the complete opposite
- **Calibration over restriction**: Learning optimal ranges rather than eliminating movement
- **Understand the why**: Knowing why a movement is problematic helps find the right solution
- **Context matters**: One golfer's fix might be another golfer's fault depending on their pattern
