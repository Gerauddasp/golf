## Overview

Athletic Motion Golf reframes the common swing fault known as "early extension" with a more accurate biomechanical term: "early thrust." Through GEARS 3D motion capture analysis tracking hip joints and knee positions, Mike and Sean demonstrate that this issue is nearly always (99.99%) a backswing problem, not a downswing problem. The video presents two practical diagnostic tests and training drills using knee tracking and depth gauges to help golfers identify and correct the root cause - improper lead femur movement in the backswing that throws the pelvis forward before impact.

## Key Concepts

### Terminology Shift: Early Extension vs. Early Thrust

- **Early Extension is a Misleading Term**: The body naturally extends throughout the swing in elite players
- **Early Thrust is the Accurate Description**: Measures pelvis movement toward/away from target line
- **Thrust Definition**: Movement of the center of the pelvis toward (positive thrust) or away (negative thrust) from the target line
- **Why It Matters**: "Early extension" causes golfers to incorrectly try to bend over more through impact, which elite players don't do
- **The Real Problem**: Early thrust toward the ball, causing the "humping" motion into impact

### The Backswing Root Cause (99.99% of Cases)

- **Not a Downswing Problem**: Trying to fix early thrust in the downswing is a "death move" - you're correcting for a backswing error
- **"Horse Already Out of the Barn"**: By the time you see thrust issues at impact on video, the damage was done in the backswing
- **The Setup Mistake**: Golfers keep their glutes on the "tush line" while letting the lead femur swing forward
- **Cascading Effect**: If the lead femur moves forward 9 inches in the backswing with no counterbalance, you will thrust into the ball

### Lead Femur Management in Backswing

- **Natural Forward Movement**: The lead (left for right-handed golfers) femur will move forward some in the backswing
- **Critical Counterbalance**: The trail hip must move back in equal amounts to maintain pelvis center position
- **The 3-3 Rule**: If lead femur moves forward 3 inches, trail hip must move back 3 inches
- **Result**: Turn around the center of the pelvis without early thrust
- **The Measurement**: GEARS sensors on hip joints track this movement with precision

### The Left Heel Lift Controversy

- **It's Okay to Lift**: Lifting the left heel is not inherently wrong
- **The Problem Pattern**: Most golfers lift the heel incorrectly - the entire femur-hip joint stays high and swings out
- **Correct Method**: Can lift heel by simply "tapping foot up and down" without changing femur position
- **Common Error**: Lifting heel while keeping both hips high prevents proper pelvis tilt angle
- **Result of Error**: Can't "play downhill" (proper pelvis angle) and opens lead hip "like a barn door"

### Pelvis vs. Hip Joints

- **Different Mental Model**: Stop thinking about individual hip joints; think about center of pelvis
- **The Wheel Analogy**: Like a tire, the outside (hip joints) must rotate to keep the center (pelvis center) stable
- **Normal Movement**: Both hip joints moving forward/backward is natural
- **Goal**: Restrict the middle of the pelvis from moving forward toward ball
- **Elite Pattern**: Both hip joints move backward through impact while pelvis center stays neutral

### Video Analysis Limitations

- **2D Illusions**: Down-the-line video can be misleading
- **Straightening Leg Illusion**: Hip internal rotation makes leg appear to straighten more than it actually does
- **Depth Perception Issues**: Femur moving away from camera looks like knee straightening
- **Interpretation Errors**: Can lead to incorrect swing thoughts and compensations
- **3D Solution**: GEARS tracking reveals true joint positions in space

## Actionable Drills

### Drill 1: Lead Knee Position Test (Face-On View)

**Purpose**: Diagnose if you have early thrust and identify the magnitude of the problem

**Setup**:
- Position yourself as if hitting toward a camera (face-on/target view)
- Have someone place a club grip or alignment stick at the center of your lead knee joint at address
- This marks your starting position

**Execution**:
1. Make a full backswing
2. Start your downswing
3. STOP when hands reach hip height (approximately halfway down)
4. Check lead knee position relative to the marker

**Success Markers**:
- Lead knee must be back to at least the starting position
- Ideally, knee should be slightly behind starting position
- If knee is still forward of marker, you have early thrust pattern

**Self-Assessment**:
- "You could imagine a dot there and say 'I don't want to move too far away from that'"
- Track how much your knee travels out in backswing
- If you travel it way out and can't get it back, curtail the backswing movement

**Equipment Alternative**: Can use any object as visual reference at knee joint

### Drill 2: Depth Gauge Training (Down-the-Line View)

**Purpose**: Train proper knee depth control through the swing to maintain pelvis center position

**Setup**:
- Place a plane board, box, or foam roller (24-inch recommended) directly against your toes at address
- Can use any flat object as depth gauge
- Position extends full width to monitor both knees

**Execution - Backswing Phase**:
1. Address ball with toes touching the board
2. Make backswing
3. **Goal**: Allow lead knee to naturally bend and come up to the board, but NOT past it
4. Let knee "just graze it" - don't stay unnaturally far away
5. As you turn, the hip joint pulling back creates space even with same knee flex

**Execution - Downswing Phase**:
1. Allow lead side to naturally extend
2. Let trail leg come forward toward the board
3. **Goal**: Trail knee should "just graze" the board, not bang into it
4. Halfway down, both knees should be slightly behind the board

**Common Errors to Avoid**:
- **DON'T**: Stay far away from board in backswing (too restrictive, unnatural)
- **DON'T**: Try to avoid board by restricting hip movement (creates awkward, contrived motion)
- **DON'T**: Snap trail knee straight trying to generate ground force
- **DON'T**: Bang either knee hard into the board

**Key Feel**:
- "You'll gain a little more space here not from necessarily the leg straightening a lot, but from the hip joint pulling the whole femur back"
- Knee can maintain same flex while femur moves back due to hip rotation
- Creates "space to play inside of" without artificial restrictions

**At-Home Setup**: 24-inch foam roller works perfectly for home practice

### Training Progression

**Phase 1: Awareness**
1. Use Drill 1 to diagnose your pattern
2. Record or have someone observe your knee travel distance
3. Identify if you're an "early thruster"

**Phase 2: Backswing Correction**
1. Focus exclusively on backswing movement
2. Use Drill 2 to establish depth boundaries
3. Work on 3-3 counterbalance (3 inches forward, 3 inches back)
4. Stop trying to fix it in downswing

**Phase 3: Pattern Integration**
1. Combine both monitoring points (face-on knee position + depth gauge)
2. Make full swings with feedback
3. Feel the center of pelvis staying stable while hip joints rotate

**Phase 4: Transfer to Course**
- Mental image: "Imagine a dot at your lead knee - don't move too far from it"
- Feel: "Turn into trail leg while letting lead femur come forward naturally"
- Result: "Windows of good solid movement" without extreme positions

## Key Takeaways

1. **Stop Calling It Early Extension**: The proper biomechanical term is "early thrust" - measuring pelvis center movement toward target line. Elite players extend throughout the swing naturally.

2. **It's a Backswing Problem (99.99%)**: You cannot successfully fix a backswing issue in the downswing. The damage is done before you start down - "the horse is already out of the barn."

3. **Lead Femur Counterbalance is Critical**: In the backswing, whatever distance your lead femur moves forward must be counterbalanced by your trail hip moving back an equal amount (3 forward, 3 back = turn around pelvis center).

4. **Lifting the Left Heel Can Be Problematic**: It's okay to lift the heel IF you maintain proper femur position. The common error is lifting while keeping the femur-hip joint high and letting it swing out "like a barn door."

5. **Knee Position is Diagnostic Gold**: Use face-on view to track lead knee position - it must return to (or behind) starting position by hands-hip-height in downswing. If it's still forward, you're thrusting.

6. **Use a Depth Gauge for Training**: Place board/box/foam roller at toes - let knees naturally come to it (graze it) but not bang into it. Creates boundaries for proper depth control without artificial restriction.

7. **Think Pelvis Center, Not Individual Hips**: Mental model shift - stop focusing on each hip joint. Focus on keeping the center of your pelvis from moving forward while allowing the "outside of the wheel to rotate."

8. **Video Can Lie**: 2D down-the-line video creates illusions - hip rotation makes legs appear to straighten more than they actually do. Trust 3D data or proper checkpoint drills.

9. **Don't Restrict Hip Movement Awkwardly**: Both hip joints should move naturally forward and back - that's normal. The goal is preventing the MIDDLE of the pelvis from thrusting forward.

10. **There Are Windows, Not One Swing**: AMG doesn't teach one specific swing but emphasizes staying within "windows of good solid movements" that allow for individual variation while maintaining proper pelvis sequencing.

## Biomechanical Insights

### GEARS Technology Findings

- **Sensor Placement**: Hip joint sensors track 3D position in space throughout swing
- **Elite Pattern**: Lead knee returns to or behind starting position by halfway down
- **Magnitude Data**: Some golfers thrust lead femur forward 9 inches while trail hip stays at zero - impossible to recover from
- **Consistency**: All elite players maintain this checkpoint regardless of individual swing style

### The Pivot Point Problem

- **Normal Pivot**: Center of pelvis remains relatively stable while hip joints rotate around it
- **Early Thrust Pivot**: Lead femur moving forward shifts the entire pivot point toward ball
- **Automatic Compensation**: Once pivot point changes, body automatically "humps" forward to reach ball
- **"Cooked In" Pattern**: Becomes almost impossible to override once backswing establishes wrong position

### Hip Joint vs. Knee Angle Distinction

- **Hip Joint Movement**: Primary driver of femur position in space
- **Knee Flex**: Can stay relatively constant while femur position changes dramatically
- **Internal Rotation Effect**: As trail leg rotates internally, femur moves back even with same knee flex
- **Visual vs. Actual**: What looks like knee straightening is often hip rotation pulling femur away from camera

### The "Playing Downhill" Concept

- **Proper Pelvis Angle**: Trail hip higher than lead hip through impact
- **Setup Requirement**: Lead hip must lower in backswing to establish this angle
- **High Hip Problem**: Lifting heel while keeping both hips high prevents proper tilt
- **Impact Position**: Both hips moving backward (not individual joint positions forward/back)

## Common Misconceptions Debunked

### Myth: "Don't Extend Through Impact"

- **Reality**: Elite players extend naturally throughout the entire swing
- **The Real Issue**: Not extension itself, but THRUST (forward movement of pelvis center)
- **Correction**: Don't try to stay bent over more - that's not what good players do

### Myth: "Fix It in the Downswing"

- **Reality**: 99.99% of cases are backswing setup issues
- **Why It Fails**: Trying to override a 9-inch deficit in 0.2 seconds is impossible
- **Correct Approach**: Fix where the problem starts - the backswing

### Myth: "Never Lift Your Left Heel"

- **Reality**: Lifting heel is fine if done correctly
- **The Distinction**: Can lift heel by tapping foot while maintaining femur position
- **The Problem**: Most golfers lift heel AND swing entire femur-hip joint out

### Myth: "Keep Your Leg Straight/Bent"

- **Reality**: Knee flex amount varies by player; focus on femur position, not knee angle
- **Why It Matters**: Same knee flex can accompany proper or improper femur position
- **Better Focus**: Track where knee joint is in space, not the angle of the knee

### Myth: "The Butt Stays on the Line"

- **Reality**: Individual hip positions move; it's the CENTER that should stay stable
- **Visual Deception**: You can keep glutes on line while still thrusting 3+ inches
- **Actual Goal**: Counterbalance hip movements around pelvis center

## Practice Implementation

### Range Session Structure

**Warm-Up (5 minutes)**:
- Set up depth gauge at toes
- Make slow-motion swings focusing on knee checkpoints
- No ball - just movement pattern

**Diagnostic Phase (5 minutes)**:
- Use Drill 1 with video or training partner
- Document your current knee travel pattern
- Establish baseline

**Training Phase (20 minutes)**:
- Use Drill 2 with depth gauge
- Start with half-swings, progress to full
- Hit balls only after feeling proper pattern without ball
- Focus: "3 forward, 3 back" thought

**Integration Phase (10 minutes)**:
- Remove depth gauge
- Hit balls while maintaining internal feel
- Spot-check with gauge every 5 swings

### Home Practice (No Balls)

- Use 24-inch foam roller as depth gauge
- Make 20 slow-motion swings daily
- Focus on feeling hip counterbalance
- Mental rehearsal of "center of pelvis staying put"

### On-Course Application

**Pre-Shot Mental Cue**: "Imagine dot at lead knee - don't lose it in backswing"

**Swing Thought Options**:
1. "3 forward, 3 back"
2. "Turn around my center"
3. "Trail hip back as lead knee bends"

**Checkpoint Feel**: Lead knee should feel like it's "coming back home" in transition

## Related Concepts

- **Ground Reaction Forces**: Proper pelvis sequencing enhances natural ground force generation; don't artificially snap knees
- **Trail Leg Extension**: Happens naturally in downswing; don't force it
- **Weight Transfer**: Is a result of proper hip sequencing, not a separate action
- **Hip Rotation**: Both internal rotation (trail leg backswing) and proper counterbalance work together
- **Tush Line**: Individual butt positions less important than pelvis center thrust measurement
- **Windows of Acceptable Movement**: Individual variation is fine within proper sequencing parameters

## Equipment Notes

**For Drill 1 (Knee Position Test)**:
- Club grip
- Alignment stick
- Any marker at knee height

**For Drill 2 (Depth Gauge)**:
- Plane board (AMG uses this)
- Cardboard box
- 24-inch foam roller (recommended for home)
- Any flat object 18-24 inches tall

**Optional Technology**:
- GEARS 3D motion capture (gold standard)
- Video camera for face-on view
- Mirror for visual feedback

## Scientific Foundation

This video emphasizes AMG's data-driven approach:

- **Sample Size**: Patterns observed across thousands of swings in GEARS database
- **Elite Player Consistency**: All high-level players demonstrate the knee checkpoint pattern
- **Measurement Precision**: 3D tracking accurate to millimeters in space
- **Causation vs. Correlation**: Backswing femur position directly causes downswing thrust pattern
- **Reproducible Testing**: Both drills provide objective feedback anyone can use
- **Windows, Not Absolutes**: Data shows ranges of acceptable movement, not single "perfect" positions

The science validates that this is not opinion-based coaching - it's measurable, observable, and correctable through proper backswing sequencing.
