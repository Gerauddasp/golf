## Overview

This video exposes the fundamental flaw in most amateur practice sessions: "React to the Last Ball" syndrome. Athletic Motion Golf demonstrates a proper practice methodology using their Swing Coach app with live biomechanical feedback from Gears motion capture, force plates, and Trackman data. The session reveals how elite players practice differently—methodically working on specific movement parameters rather than reacting to ball flight outcomes. Using Shawn as a demonstration subject, the video shows a complete practice progression from identifying swing tendencies through speed integration, ultimately calibrating feels to match biomechanical reality at full game speed.

## Key Concepts

### The #1 Practice Mistake: React to the Last Ball Syndrome

**The Problem**:
- Amateur golfers arrive at the range with good intentions but quickly devolve into reactive mode
- Ball flight dictates swing adjustments: "Hit it right → close the face; hit it left → turn more"
- This becomes exercise, not practice—wasting 90+ minutes without improvement
- No systematic approach to addressing root causes

**Why It Fails**:
- No objective feedback on what the body/club actually did
- Ball flight is an outcome, not a cause
- Creates inconsistent feels based on compensations
- Reinforces bad patterns under the guise of "fixing" shots

### Elite Player Practice Philosophy

**How Tour Players Practice Differently**:
- "Much less sexy than you would think—very methodical, very boring"
- Focus on body and club movement parameters, not ball flight initially
- Use foam balls or nets to remove ball flight distraction
- Work with objective measurement systems (Gears, force plates, video analysis)
- Have clear parameter targets for each practice session

**The Professional Approach**:
1. Identify specific movement tendencies (e.g., "inside takeaway by 3°")
2. Work on 1-2 parameters maximum per session
3. Build speed gradually (25% → 50% → 75% → game speed)
4. Calibrate feels at each speed level
5. Accept poor ball flight during movement pattern changes

### The Setup Foundation Principle

**Critical Discovery from This Session**:
- Setup position has massive influence on swing path/plane parameters
- Setup flaws "creep in" imperceptibly over time—you adapt and they feel normal
- Shawn's tendency: Excessive knee bend under pressure
- This setup error made his inside takeaway tendency much worse

**Setup Parameter Monitoring**:
- Knee flex amount
- Forward spine bend (hip hinge)
- Hand height
- Wrist angles at address

**Key Insight**: "Setup feedback made this change MUCH easier. I'm not going to hit balls anymore without this setup monitoring."

### Speed Integration Protocol

**The Progressive Speed Methodology**:

**Phase 1: Pattern Establishment (25% speed)**
- Focus exclusively on target movement parameters
- No concern for ball flight or distance
- Repeat until consistent "good swing" feedback
- Shawn's target: Takeaway on plane, halfway back steep by 1° (vs. his normal shallow by 3°)

**Phase 2: Moderate Speed Test (50% speed)**
- Begin adding swing speed while maintaining parameters
- Check if pattern holds under slightly increased load
- If pattern breaks down, return to 25% speed

**Phase 3: Three-Quarter Speed Integration (75% speed)**
- This is where most players' patterns begin to break down
- Requires adjusted feels to counter speed-induced tendencies
- Example: Shawn felt like he was taking it "more out" but remained on plane

**Phase 4: Game Speed Calibration (90-100% speed)**
- Simulate actual on-course scenarios
- Final feel calibration for playing speed
- Verify all parameters hold under full dynamic load

**Critical Principle**: "Your feels haven't adjusted to higher swing speeds yet. You just adjusted it and you thought it was going to be out. It was dead on."

### Feel Calibration vs. Reality

**The Disconnect Between Feel and Real**:
- What you feel you're doing often doesn't match biomechanical reality
- Exaggerated feels may be necessary to produce correct movements
- Feels must be recalibrated at different swing speeds
- Today's calibration may need adjustment after 2 weeks of practice

**Shawn's Feel Discovery**:
- Normal swing: Inside by 3°, shallow by 3°
- To get on plane, he felt: "Little bit of upward motion with trail arm, elbow fold for lift, wrist angles don't change much, club pointed more at ball line"
- At 75% speed, had to feel "opposite—outward and around, up with handle not low and in"
- Result: Dead on plane (not out like he felt)

**Long-term Feel Evolution**:
- Week 1: May need to feel "very out" to get on plane
- Week 2-3: Movement becomes more natural
- Eventually: May need to reduce exaggeration or you'll go too far out (outside by 2°)

### The Body's Trackman Concept

**Measurement Philosophy**:
- "They'll use Trackman to calibrate carry distances for their environment. This is Trackman for the body."
- Daily variability exists: Sleep quality, stiffness, soreness, fatigue
- Setup positions drift imperceptibly (bent over 10° more feels normal)
- Real-time feedback catches these variations immediately

**Why Even Tour Players Need This**:
- Coaches aren't always present
- Bad tendencies creep in for everyone ("Number one player in the world on down")
- Need "reliable, unbiased, non-emotional feedback"
- Humans don't feel things correctly in real time

## Actionable Practice Protocol

### Pre-Practice Setup: Equipment and Parameters

**Required Elements**:
- Objective feedback system (Swing Coach app, video, coach, launch monitor)
- Clear identification of your swing tendencies
- Decision on 1-2 parameters to work on for this session
- Foam balls or net setup to remove ball flight distraction (initially)

**Shawn's Example Parameters**:
- Problem identified: Inside takeaway by 3°, shallow halfway back by 3°
- At higher speeds: Goes "two under" (severe inside-under path)
- Result: Blocks and hooks
- Secondary issue: Excessive knee bend in setup (especially under pressure)

### The Practice Session Structure

**Step 1: Baseline Assessment (3-5 swings)**
- Hit stock shots at normal tempo
- Review full swing summary
- Identify primary tendencies across all parameters
- Select 1-2 target parameters for today

**Step 2: Setup Monitoring (Throughout session)**
- Turn on ALL setup parameters
- Establish baseline: Hip hinge forward, "barely cracking knees"
- Get feedback on each setup before swinging
- Build awareness of correct setup feel

**Step 3: Slow Speed Repetitions (15-20 swings at 25%)**
- Focus ONLY on target parameters
- Ignore ball flight completely
- Discover what feels produce correct movements
- Stack "good swing" repetitions
- Goal: Consistent execution at slow speed

**Step 4: Speed Integration Progression**
- 50% speed: 10-15 swings, verify pattern holds
- 75% speed: 10-15 swings, adjust feels as needed
- Game speed: 5-10 swings, final calibration

**Step 5: Setup Independence Test**
- Turn off setup feedback
- Attempt to find correct positions by feel
- Verify with periodic checks
- Build ability to self-monitor setup

**Step 6: Full Swing Summary Review**
- Check if target parameters improved
- Identify if other parameters broke down
- Adjust practice plan for next session

### Feel Discovery Protocol

**How to Translate Data into Actionable Feels**:

1. **Make the mistake intentionally**: Feel what your bad tendency actually is
2. **Make the correction**: Note what changes in sensation
3. **Verbalize the feel**: "Little bit up with the arms, not much wrist, just turning"
4. **Test at higher speed**: Feels will need to be MORE exaggerated
5. **Get feedback**: Discover if your feel matched reality
6. **Adjust and repeat**: Calibrate feel until it produces correct movement

**Shawn's Feel Progression Example**:
- 25% speed: "Wrist angles don't change much, little upward motion"
- 75% speed: "Opposite, outward and around, up with handle"
- Result: Both produced on-plane takeaway despite very different feels

### Speed-Specific Practice Guidelines

**25% Speed Phase**:
- Duration: Until 8-10 consecutive "good" repetitions
- Focus: Pure movement pattern
- Accept: Awkwardness, mishits, discomfort
- Shawn: "Doesn't really bother me. Sometimes I'm like 'well that has to be different cuz I just whiffed it'"

**50% Speed Phase**:
- Duration: 10-15 swings
- Goal: Maintain pattern with slight intensity increase
- If fails: Return to 25%

**75% Speed Phase**:
- Duration: 10-15 swings
- This is where compensation patterns typically emerge
- Critical calibration point: "This is where we all get in trouble"
- Must develop "counter-feel" for higher speeds

**Game Speed Phase**:
- Duration: 5-10 swings
- Simulate: Specific on-course holes/situations
- Example: "Number 3 at Disney, par 3 with 8-iron"
- Goal: Verify pattern holds at playing speed

### Daily Practice Application

**Session Frequency Requirements**:
- "This is a daily practice"
- Feels must be calibrated each session
- Variables change day-to-day: Sleep, stiffness, soreness
- Cannot assume yesterday's feels apply today

**Long-term Progression (2+ weeks)**:
- Week 1: Establish pattern at all speeds with exaggerated feels
- Week 2: Pattern becomes more natural, less exaggeration needed
- Week 3+: May need to reduce exaggeration to avoid overcorrection
- Cycle continues: Monitor, adjust, recalibrate

### The Tolerance Concept

**Measurement Precision by Skill Level**:

**Tour Players/Elite**: Tight tolerances
- On plane ± 1°
- Consistency is paramount
- Small deviations impact performance

**Better Players**: Moderate tolerances
- 2-3° variance acceptable
- Shawn's example: Inside by 1° at 75% speed was "satisfying"

**Developing Players**: Wider tolerances
- May start inside by 7° or steep by 8°
- Focus on moving toward better ranges
- Expect larger variances initially

**Key Point**: "The feedback is the important part. Your expectation for a shot is going to be dependent on how well you can keep repeating these movements."

## Key Takeaways

1. **Stop React-to-Last-Ball Practice**: This is exercise, not practice. You're wasting your time adjusting to outcomes instead of addressing causes.

2. **Use Objective Feedback Systems**: "You need reliable, unbiased, non-emotional feedback, which usually isn't us." Swing Coach app, video analysis, launch monitors, or coach oversight are essential.

3. **Setup is Foundational**: Setup flaws creep in imperceptibly and sabotage swing changes. Monitor setup parameters constantly, especially knee flex, spine bend, and hand height.

4. **Remove Ball Flight Initially**: Use foam balls or nets when working on movement patterns. Ball flight is a distraction during pattern change phases.

5. **Focus on 1-2 Parameters Maximum**: Shawn worked on takeaway plane and halfway-back plane only. Don't try to fix everything at once.

6. **Build Speed Progressively**: 25% → 50% → 75% → game speed. Each level requires feel recalibration. Most patterns break down between 50-75% if not properly integrated.

7. **Expect Exaggerated Feels**: To make correct movements, you'll likely need to feel like you're doing something extreme. Shawn felt "way out" but was dead on plane.

8. **Accept Poor Shots During Changes**: "Your feel for impact is not going to be the same if you change one, two, or three things. Allow yourself time to adjust."

9. **Practice Daily with Feedback**: "This is a daily practice." Variables change day-to-day. Yesterday's calibration may not apply today.

10. **Even Tour Players Do This**: "Every from number one player in the world on down, we all have bad tendencies that will creep in if we aren't constantly challenging them."

11. **Trackman for the Body**: Just as players calibrate carry distances with Trackman for different conditions, use biomechanical feedback to calibrate movement patterns for daily body variations.

12. **Long-term Feel Evolution**: After 2-3 weeks of correct movement, you may need to REDUCE exaggerated feels or you'll overcorrect in the opposite direction.

### Pattern Change Acceptance

- New movements will initially produce poor shots—this is expected and acceptable
- "Sometimes I don't mind it at all cuz I'm like 'well that has to be different cuz I just whiffed it'"
- Your impact feel changes when you change body/club movements
- Allow time to adjust to get ball where you want it

### The Slow-Speed Training Philosophy

- Shawn hits "a lot of practice balls at 25% pace"
- Gives you the baseline feel without compensations
- Builds the correct movement pattern in the nervous system
- "Gives me a feel" that can then be scaled to higher speeds

### Pre-Shot Routine Monitoring

- Shawn discovered his swing trigger (knee flex increase) was sabotaging his setup
- "I'm going to be fairly cognizant of making sure my swing trigger isn't adding knee flex"
- Even small movements during the trigger can alter setup positions
- Need to monitor full routine, not just static address position

### The Imperceptible Drift Phenomenon

- "Setup's one of those things that just gradually happens... feels normal"
- "You don't set up this way one day and this way the next. Over time it creeps in. It's a slow burn."
- Can wake up with stiff back and bend over 10° more—feels fine but ruins swing mechanics
- Why daily calibration with feedback is essential

## Practice Session Time Allocation

**Estimated Total Session Time**: 45-60 minutes

- Setup calibration: 5-10 minutes
- Baseline assessment: 5 minutes
- 25% speed phase: 15-20 minutes
- 50% speed phase: 8-10 minutes
- 75% speed phase: 8-10 minutes
- Game speed phase: 5-8 minutes
- Review and notes: 5 minutes

**Compare to Typical Amateur**:
- 90 minutes hitting balls reactively
- Zero improvement in movement patterns
- Reinforcement of bad tendencies
- Exhaustion without progress

**ROI Comparison**: 45 minutes of focused, data-driven practice produces more improvement than 90+ minutes of reactive ball beating.
