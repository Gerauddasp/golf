## Overview

This short-form video presents an AMG-certified downswing checkpoint drill focused on proper sequencing and separation between the upper and lower body. The drill emphasizes maintaining shoulder closure while allowing the pelvis to rotate toward the target, creating the critical separation necessary for efficient power transfer and improved contact quality. This position serves as a key transition checkpoint in the downswing sequence.

## Key Concepts

### Upper/Lower Body Separation
- Create and maintain separation between shoulders and pelvis during transition
- Shoulders remain "closed" (pointing away from target) while lower body initiates forward motion
- This separation is the hallmark of efficient biomechanical sequencing
- The differential creates stored energy for release through impact

### Transition Position Checkpoint
- **Critical checkpoint**: Midway through downswing before release
- Thighs should be square to target line
- Pelvis position: square to slightly open (5-15° open)
- Shoulders remain closed with "shirt buttons" pointing down the line (away from target)
- Club should be in proper delivery position
- This position indicates proper sequencing is occurring

### Feel vs. Reality
- The feel of "keeping shoulders closed" creates proper separation
- In reality, shoulders are rotating, but slower than pelvis
- The relative difference between rotation rates creates the separation
- "If you can get to that spot, the rest of the downswing is a blink of an eye"

## Actionable Drills

### Separation Checkpoint Drill
**Purpose**: Develop proper downswing sequencing with upper/lower body separation

**Setup**:
- Address position with any club
- Make full backswing creating shoulder/hip separation
- Focus on feeling the coil at top of swing

**Execution**:
1. From top of backswing, maintain shoulder position (keep "closed")
2. Initiate downswing by rotating pelvis back toward square/slightly open
3. Allow thighs to return to square position
4. Keep shirt buttons pointing down the line (away from target)
5. Check club position - should be in proper delivery slot
6. Pause at this checkpoint position to verify:
   - Thighs square
   - Pelvis square to slightly open
   - Shoulders still closed
   - Club in good position
7. From this checkpoint, complete swing allowing natural release

**Success Markers**:
- Clear separation visible between shoulder line and pelvis line
- No early shoulder opening (over-the-top move)
- Pelvis leads rotational sequence
- Club approaches from inside
- Improved contact quality (ball-first contact)
- Better accuracy from proper delivery path

### Static Position Practice
**Purpose**: Ingrain the feel of proper checkpoint position

**Setup**: No ball needed initially

**Execution**:
1. Make slow-motion backswing
2. Initiate transition with lower body
3. Pause at checkpoint position
4. Hold for 3-5 seconds while checking:
   - Thigh alignment (square)
   - Pelvis position (square to slightly open)
   - Shoulder position (closed, buttons pointing away)
   - Club position (proper slot)
5. Repeat 10 times per practice session
6. Progress to adding ball once position is consistent

**Success Markers**:
- Can consistently recreate checkpoint position
- Position feels natural, not forced
- Can maintain balance in checkpoint position
- Understand the "feel" of proper separation

## Key Takeaways

1. **Separation is critical**: The differential between shoulder rotation and pelvis rotation creates efficient power transfer and proper delivery path

2. **Checkpoint position indicators**: Thighs square, pelvis square to slightly open, shoulders closed with shirt buttons pointing away from target

3. **Lower body leads**: Pelvis initiates the downswing while shoulders maintain their closed position momentarily

4. **Speed comes from sequence**: Getting to this checkpoint position correctly allows the rest of the downswing to happen naturally and rapidly

5. **Visual checkpoint**: Use "shirt buttons pointing down the line" as simple feel for maintaining shoulder closure during transition

## Biomechanical Principles (AMG Style)

- **Kinematic Sequence**: Proper sequencing requires pelvis to lead rotation, followed by torso, arms, then club
- **X-Factor Stretch**: The separation between pelvis and shoulders in transition increases power potential
- **Path Control**: Maintaining shoulder closure prevents over-the-top moves and promotes inside delivery
- **Centripetal Acceleration**: Proper sequencing allows maximum club head speed through efficient energy transfer

## Common Errors to Avoid

- Opening shoulders too early (spinning out)
- Failing to rotate pelvis back to square
- Allowing shoulders and pelvis to rotate together (loss of separation)
- Over-rotating pelvis beyond slightly open at checkpoint
- Rushing through checkpoint without establishing proper position
