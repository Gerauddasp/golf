## Overview

This video addresses the most critical distance in the golf swing: the space between your hands and your body, which Athletic Motion Golf refers to as "the most important real estate in the golf swing." Through a case study of a student seeking more speed, the instructors reveal how common misconceptions about rotation and depth actually destroy swing width and limit speed generation. The solution is surprisingly simple and involves understanding proper shoulder mechanics—specifically, trail shoulder retraction combined with arm lift—rather than wrapping the arms around the body.

## The Problem: Overindexing Rotation and Depth at the Expense of Width

### Common Misconception Pattern
- **Student Goal**: More speed through increased rotation and depth
- **What He Had**: Too much backswing rotation and excessive depth
- **What He Lost**: Width (distance between hands and body center)
- **Result**: Ruined speed potential despite achieving his stated goals

### The Width Killer: The "Lawnmower Movement"
**What It Is**: Pulling the trail arm behind the body using arm bend rather than arm lift

**Why It Fails**:
- Exhausts arm bend before arm lift can engage
- Brings hands closer to the body as they move behind you
- Creates the feeling of "choking yourself out"
- Prevents recovery in the downswing

**Biomechanical Reality**:
- Arms have weight; club has weight
- Using that weight to create more turn naturally pulls hands toward your body
- More turn + more depth = less width (when done incorrectly)

### The "No Arm Lift" Misconception
**False Belief**: Arms don't lift in the backswing; they only turn

**Actual Consequence**:
- Arms wrap around the ribcage
- Trail arm goes around the body instead of up
- Fear of vertical motion (up and down) in the arms
- Results in hands already outside the shoulder too early in the backswing

## The Width Diagnostic: Chest-High Resquare Test

### How to Perform the Test
1. **Setup**: Address position with club
2. **Backswing**: Take club to chest-high position
3. **Stand Up**: Without moving your arms, stand up from posture
4. **Resquare**: Turn your chest back to square (facing target)
5. **Check**: Where are your hands relative to your torso?

### Reading the Results

**FAIL Indicators**:
- Glove hand is already outside your shoulder line
- Hands are beyond the side of your body
- No space between body and hands
- Trail shoulder is "packed" (forward in socket)

**PASS Indicators**:
- Glove hand is approximately at the center of your torso
- Significant space between hands and body
- Trail shoulder is visible from face-on view (retracted)
- Room for arm lift in the swing

### What This Reveals
The test exposes whether you're creating width through proper shoulder mechanics or destroying it through excessive turn and arm wrapping.

## The Solution: Shoulder Retraction + Arm Lift

### Understanding Shoulder Socket Movement

**Protraction** (Lead Shoulder):
- Left shoulder moves forward in socket
- Natural consequence of body rotation

**Retraction** (Trail Shoulder):
- Right shoulder moves back in socket
- CRITICAL for maintaining width
- Must move away from your hands, not forward

### The Key Concept: Move Shoulder Away From Hands

**Not**: Push hands away from shoulder
**Instead**: Move trail shoulder away from hands

**Why This Matters**:
- If shoulder position is poor, pushing hands away doesn't fix the problem
- Shoulder retraction creates the space automatically
- This is a learned motion that feels unnatural at first

### The Measurement

**Shoulder Retraction Advantage**:
- Can add 30-35° of effective "turn"
- Described as "a sixth gear in the golf swing"
- Achieved through proper shoulder socket operation, not body contortion

### Proper Sequencing
1. Trail shoulder retracts (moves back in socket)
2. Arms lift (vertical component)
3. Wrists set (creating more width)
4. From this position, pivot initiates downswing
5. Club and arms work down in front of body automatically

## Actionable Drills

### Drill 1: Shoulder-Width Arms Straight Drill

**Purpose**: Forces correct shoulder retraction and prevents arm wrapping

**Equipment**: Any club

**Setup**:
- Hold club with both hands
- Hands shoulder-width apart on grip
- **CRITICAL**: Keep both arms completely straight throughout

**Execution**:
1. Start from address with arms straight
2. Turn back to target while maintaining straight arms
3. Feel the trail shoulder move away from hands
4. Make the trail shoulder "disappear behind your head" (from down-the-line view)
5. With back to target, slide lead hand down the grip
6. You're now in proper backswing position with width intact

**Success Markers**:
- Impossible to roll trail shoulder forward (arm straightness prevents this)
- Trail shoulder is visible from target side (retracted position)
- Hands maintain distance from body throughout
- Position feels more "in front of you" than expected
- Natural slot position achieved in downswing

**Progression**:
- Practice the motion without ball first
- Add chip shots from the position
- Graduate to fuller swings maintaining the feel

### Drill 2: The Rectangle/Box Drill

**Purpose**: Maintain the hand-shoulder relationship throughout backswing

**Concept**: Create a "rectangle" or "box" shape with your arms and shoulders

**Execution**:
1. Setup: Visualize rectangle formed by shoulders (top) and hands (bottom)
2. Backswing: Keep the rectangle intact—don't collapse it
3. Turn back to target while maintaining rectangle shape
4. Slide lead hand down grip
5. Swing through without hitting ball initially

**Key Feel**:
- Rectangle maintains its shape
- Turning doesn't mean collapsing the shape
- When you pivot from this position, club drops into slot automatically

**Common Error**:
- Pulling trail elbow behind body collapses the rectangle
- Turning like "a block of wood" (chest and shoulders moving together)

### Drill 3: Assisted Shoulder Retraction

**Purpose**: Learn the feel of proper trail shoulder position

**Requirements**: Training partner or instructor

**Execution**:
1. Take backswing to chest-high position
2. Partner pushes on trail shoulder (retracting it back)
3. Partner pushes hands away from body simultaneously
4. Stand up and resquare to feel the proper position
5. Notice the arm lift that's now present

**What You'll Feel**:
- Significant difference in hand position
- More "up" in the arms than expected
- Trail shoulder feels farther back than natural
- Much more space between hands and body

## Key Biomechanical Principles

### The Turn Paradox
**Misconception**: More body rotation = more power
**Reality**: Body rotation provides inward motion automatically; you still need width with hands and arms

**Proper Understanding**:
- Turn creates depth naturally
- Width must be maintained independently through shoulder mechanics
- Shoulders must move MORE than chest
- This is not "turning like a block of wood"

### The Width Priority Hierarchy
1. **Most Important**: Distance between hands and body (width)
2. **Secondary**: Amount of rotation achieved
3. **Tertiary**: Depth of club position

**Why**: Width is non-recoverable if lost; rotation and depth can be adjusted, but lost width destroys speed potential.

### Arm Lift vs. Arm Bend
**Proper Sequence**:
- Arm lift happens BEFORE exhausting arm bend
- Vertical component (lift) is necessary and beneficial
- Bend without lift = lawnmower movement

**Packed Shoulder Analogy**:
- "Arm wrestling position" = packed shoulder (wrong)
- Shoulder retracted back = space for hands to maintain width (correct)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Depth at All Costs
- Trying to touch wall behind you with club
- Results in coming out of posture
- Pulls trail arm way behind ribcage
- "Chokes yourself out"

### Mistake 2: Just Pushing Hands Away
- Doesn't fix underlying shoulder position problem
- Must move shoulder first, then hands have room

### Mistake 3: Rolling Trail Shoulder Forward
- Limits ability to turn
- Creates awkward position
- Prevents proper slot position in downswing

### Mistake 4: Chasing Feels Without Video Verification
- Don't rely on rehearsal or intent
- Must film yourself to verify actual motion
- Develop YOUR feels based on YOUR correct movement
- Feels will become less extreme as you improve

## Practice Protocol

### Phase 1: Feel Development
1. Perform chest-high resquare test to establish baseline
2. Practice shoulder-width arms straight drill (no ball)
3. Use partner for assisted shoulder retraction feel
4. **Film yourself** to verify correct positions

### Phase 2: Feel Calibration
1. Continue filming all practice
2. Compare feel to reality on video
3. "Earn the feels" through correct repetition
4. Calibrate as movements feel less extreme

### Phase 3: Integration
1. Add chip shots from correct position
2. Progress to half swings
3. Graduate to full swings
4. Maintain width awareness throughout

### Critical Reminder
**"You got to earn feels, guys."**
- Feels are calibrated through correct repetition
- Better you get = less extreme it feels
- Don't chase others' feels
- Know what YOUR correct movement feels like to YOU

## Video Feedback Best Practices

### What to Film
- Down-the-line view (most important for width)
- Face-on view (shows shoulder retraction)
- Chest-high position checkpoint

### What to Look For
- Trail shoulder visible on target side (retracted)
- Hands in front of trail shoulder (face-on)
- Space between hands and body
- Trail elbow NOT pulled behind ribcage

### When to Check
- Every practice session initially
- Weekly once feels are established
- Anytime swing feels "off"

## Key Takeaways

1. **Width is the most important real estate in the golf swing**—the distance between hands and body is non-recoverable if lost in the backswing.

2. **Overindexing rotation and depth destroys width**—common advice to "turn more" and "get deep" often leads to the lawnmower movement that kills speed.

3. **Trail shoulder retraction is the key**—move the shoulder away from your hands, not just hands away from shoulder.

4. **Arms DO lift**—vertical component is necessary and beneficial; "no arm lift" is a misconception that causes arm wrapping.

5. **Shoulders move MORE than chest**—proper shoulder socket operation (30-35° of retraction) is like "a sixth gear" for creating functional turn.

6. **The arms-straight drill is foolproof**—holding the club shoulder-width with straight arms forces correct shoulder mechanics.

7. **Film yourself religiously**—don't rely on feels until you've earned them through verified correct repetition.

8. **Good movements are easier movements**—if it feels like you're "tying yourself in knots," you're probably overindexing something at the expense of width.

## AMG Philosophy Notes
