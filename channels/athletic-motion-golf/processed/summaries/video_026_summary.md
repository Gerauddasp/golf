## Overview

This short video highlights two critical hip movements that every elite golfer performs but many amateur golfers are incorrectly advised to avoid. The focus is on hip depth during rotation and pelvic tilt (anterior-posterior tilting), both of which are essential for generating power and maintaining proper swing mechanics. The instructor references TPI (Titleist Performance Institute) movement screening principles to explain the importance of pelvic mobility and motor control.

## Key Concepts

### Two Essential Hip Movements

**1. Hip Depth During Rotation**
- Every great player creates significant depth as the hips rotate
- This is a universal characteristic among elite players
- Many golfers are incorrectly advised to avoid this movement
- Creating depth allows for proper sequencing and power generation

**2. Pelvic Tilt (Anterior-Posterior)**
- Forward bend/tilt of the pelvis during rotation
- This is the tilting motion between anterior (forward) and posterior (backward) pelvic positions
- Essential for proper swing biomechanics
- Often restricted in amateur golfers

### TPI Movement Screen: Pelvic Tilt Assessment

**Assessment Protocol**
- Arch and flatten the lower back while keeping the torso completely still
- Tests the ability to isolate pelvic movement from thoracic/upper body movement
- Common indicators of restriction:
  - Excessive shaking during the movement
  - Inability to isolate pelvic motion
  - Torso movement compensation

**Restriction Causes**
- Physical mobility restrictions (tight hip flexors, lower back stiffness)
- Motor pattern deficiency (brain hasn't trained the muscles to perform the movement)
- Neuromuscular control issues

### Biomechanical Importance

**Why These Movements Matter**
- Every elite player demonstrates these patterns
- Inability to perform these movements correlates with swing struggles
- Proper pelvic control is foundational to correct movement sequencing
- These movements are often incorrectly discouraged in golf instruction

## Actionable Drills

### Pelvic Tilt Isolation Drill

**Purpose**: Develop independent pelvic control and improve anterior-posterior pelvic mobility

**Setup**:
- Stand in neutral posture
- Keep torso and shoulders completely still
- Focus awareness on lower back and pelvis

**Execution**:
1. Arch the lower back (anterior pelvic tilt) - tailbone moves backward
2. Flatten the lower back (posterior pelvic tilt) - tailbone tucks under
3. Keep the torso and upper body motionless throughout
4. Perform slow, controlled repetitions
5. Start with 10-15 repetitions
6. Gradually increase range of motion as control improves

**Success Markers**:
- Smooth movement without shaking or jerking
- Complete isolation - no torso movement
- Full range of motion from arch to flatten
- No compensatory movements in shoulders or upper back
- Feeling of control and awareness of pelvic position

**Common Mistakes**:
- Moving the entire spine instead of isolating the pelvis
- Excessive shaking (indicates restriction or motor pattern issue)
- Limited range of motion
- Compensating with shoulder or thoracic movement

**Progression**:
- Once mastered standing, practice in golf posture
- Integrate the movement into slow-motion swings
- Apply to full swing with awareness of pelvic position throughout

### Hip Depth Awareness Drill

**Purpose**: Understand and feel proper hip depth during rotation

**Setup**:
- Address position with club
- Focus on hip movement during rotation

**Execution**:
1. During backswing, allow hips to create depth as they rotate
2. Feel the hips move both rotationally and with depth (moving back/away from target)
3. Don't restrict or limit natural hip movement
4. Compare to swings where hip depth is artificially limited

**Success Markers**:
- Feeling of natural, unrestricted hip rotation
- Increased power sensation
- Better sequencing from lower to upper body
- Hip position similar to tour player patterns

## Key Takeaways

1. **Every elite golfer creates hip depth during rotation** - this is universal among great players, not just common

2. **Pelvic tilt (anterior-posterior) is essential** - the ability to tilt the pelvis while keeping the torso still is fundamental to proper swing mechanics

3. **Many golfers are incorrectly advised to avoid these movements** - common instruction often discourages hip depth and pelvic tilt, contradicting what tour players actually do

4. **Restriction can be physical or neurological** - shaking during pelvic tilt drills indicates either mobility restrictions or motor pattern deficiency

5. **TPI movement screening identifies limitations** - the pelvic tilt screen is a simple but powerful assessment tool for golf-specific movement capability

6. **Motor patterns require training** - if you can't perform pelvic isolation, your brain hasn't learned to control those muscles independently

## Practical Applications

### For Practice Sessions
- Include pelvic tilt drills in warm-up routine
- Practice hip depth awareness during range work
- Film swings to verify hip movement patterns match elite players
- Don't artificially restrict hip movement based on outdated advice

### Self-Assessment
- Test your pelvic tilt ability using the TPI screen
- Note any shaking, restriction, or compensation patterns
- If restricted, dedicate time to motor pattern development
- Consider working with a TPI-certified instructor for detailed assessment

## Scientific Context

**Biomechanical Principle**: The pelvis is the foundation of rotational power in the golf swing. Proper anterior-posterior tilting combined with rotational depth allows for optimal energy transfer from ground forces through the kinetic chain.

**Motor Learning**: Shaking during isolated pelvic movement indicates the central nervous system hasn't established the neural pathways for independent pelvic control. This requires deliberate practice and motor learning, not just flexibility training.

**Common Instruction Myths**: Despite evidence from 3D motion capture showing universal hip depth and pelvic tilt patterns among elite players, many instructional methods still discourage these movements, creating mechanical restrictions that limit power and consistency.
