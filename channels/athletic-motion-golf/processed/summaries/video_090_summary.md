## Overview

This short instructional video identifies the most common grip mistake among amateur golfers and provides two tour-proven drills to correct it. The video focuses on proper hand placement on the club, emphasizing finger-based positioning rather than palm-based grip. The biomechanical principle demonstrated shows how arm rotation affects grip placement, with practical solutions that automatically position the hands correctly.

## Key Concepts

### The Grip Mistake: Palm-Heavy Placement

**The Problem**: Standing at normal address position and simply lowering the hand onto the club
- Results in club sitting too deep in the palm
- Restricts wrist mobility and hinge
- Reduces ability to release the club effectively
- Limits clubhead speed potential
- Decreases accuracy

### The Correct Position: Finger-Based Grip

**Target Placement**:
- Club positioned in the base of the fingers (not palm)
- Heel pad of the hand rests on top of the grip
- Allows natural wrist hinge and release
- Promotes optimal biomechanics

**Benefits**:
- Freer wrist hinge throughout the swing
- Enhanced club release through impact
- Increased clubhead speed
- Improved ball flight consistency and accuracy

### Biomechanical Principle: Arm Rotation and Grip Placement

**Key Insight**: The position of the arm rotation when gripping the club determines where the club naturally sits in the hand
- Normal address position = arm rotation that promotes palm placement
- Modified arm positions = rotation that promotes finger/heel pad placement
- Tour players exploit this principle with specific gripping drills

## Actionable Drills

### Drill 1: Behind-the-Back Grip Method

**Purpose**: Automatically position the club in the fingers with heel pad on top

**Setup**:
- Stand in normal posture
- Position hand behind your body
- Hold club while hand is in this rotated position

**Execution**:
1. Extend hand behind your back
2. Grip the club while arm is in this rotated position
3. The altered arm rotation automatically places club in fingers
4. Heel pad naturally sits on top of grip
5. Maintain this grip as you bring club to address position

**Success Markers**:
- Club feels secure in finger base
- Heel pad pressure on top of grip
- Wrist feels mobile and capable of hinging freely

**AMG Technical Note**: This drill is commonly observed in tour player pre-round routines, suggesting professional validation of the biomechanical principle

### Drill 2: In-Front Grip Method

**Purpose**: Alternative arm rotation method to achieve proper finger-based grip placement

**Setup**:
- Stand in normal posture
- Position hand in front of your body
- Hold club while hand is in this rotated position

**Execution**:
1. Extend hand forward in front of body
2. Grip the club while arm is in this forward-rotated position
3. The altered arm rotation facilitates placement under heel pad
4. Club automatically seats in finger base
5. Maintain grip as you move to address position

**Success Markers**:
- Same as Drill 1: finger-based placement, heel pad on top
- Increased awareness of wrist mobility
- Natural hinge feel during practice swings

**AMG Technical Note**: Either drill produces the same biomechanical result; choose based on personal preference and feel

### Practice Protocol

**Immediate Application**:
1. Perform chosen drill before each range session
2. Take 5-10 practice swings focusing on wrist hinge feel
3. Verify grip placement before each shot initially
4. Gradually reduce checking frequency as muscle memory develops

**Long-Term Integration**:
- Use drill as part of pre-round warm-up
- Revert to drill if grip feel becomes uncertain during round
- Periodic checks to prevent regression to palm-heavy placement

## Key Takeaways

1. **Never grip the club by simply lowering your hand onto it at address** - this creates palm-heavy placement that restricts swing mechanics

2. **Proper grip = fingers + heel pad on top** - club in base of fingers with heel pad pressure on top of grip for optimal biomechanics

3. **Use arm rotation drills to automatically achieve correct placement** - behind-the-back or in-front positioning exploits biomechanics to make proper grip effortless

4. **Correct grip unlocks wrist action** - finger-based grip allows natural hinge, release, and speed generation that palm grip prevents

5. **Tour-proven method** - professional players regularly use these drills, validating the biomechanical principles

## Biomechanical Analysis

### Why Palm Grip Fails

**Mechanical Restrictions**:
- Palm tissue is relatively immobile compared to fingers
- Reduces available range of motion in wrist joints
- Creates tension in forearm musculature
- Limits ability to square clubface through impact via release

**Speed Loss Mechanism**:
- Restricted wrist hinge = reduced lag creation
- Limited release = inability to maximize clubhead acceleration through impact zone
- Tension in grip = slower overall swing tempo and rhythm

### Why Finger Grip Succeeds

**Mechanical Advantages**:
- Fingers provide dynamic grip pressure control
- Heel pad on top creates stable platform while allowing wrist mobility
- Natural hinge axis alignment with wrist joints
- Facilitates passive clubface rotation (release) through impact

**Speed Gain Mechanism**:
- Free wrist hinge = optimal lag angle creation
- Efficient release = maximum acceleration through impact
- Reduced tension = faster, smoother overall motion

## Common Errors and Corrections

**Error**: Attempting to grip "in the fingers" while at normal address
- **Problem**: Arm rotation still wrong, grip reverts to palm during swing
- **Correction**: Must use one of the two drills to change arm rotation first

**Error**: Gripping too weakly when trying finger placement
- **Problem**: Overcompensation leading to club control loss
- **Correction**: Fingers should hold firmly; heel pad provides stability

**Error**: Only applying drill to lead hand
- **Problem**: Trail hand still in palm can create conflict
- **Correction**: Apply same principle to both hands (though video focuses on lead hand concept)

## Integration with Full Swing

**Checkpoints During Swing**:
- Address: Verify finger/heel pad placement
- Takeaway: Feel natural wrist cock beginning
- Top of backswing: Full wrist hinge without manipulation
- Downswing: Trust the release without conscious hand action
- Follow-through: Club should feel like it "releases itself"

**Feel Goals**:
- Grip security without tension
- Wrist mobility throughout motion
- Effortless clubhead speed increase
- Improved strike quality and ball flight
