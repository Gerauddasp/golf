## Overview

This short instructional video presents a simple at-home drill using a plane board to develop proper hip movement patterns throughout the golf swing. The drill addresses common hip sequencing issues during transition and impact, focusing on maintaining proper relationship to the "tush line" (the angle of the pelvis at address). The exercise emphasizes natural hip rotation and weight transfer patterns that promote biomechanically efficient movement without artificial positioning.

## Key Concepts

### Tush Line Maintenance
- **Tush Line Definition**: The angle created by the rear end/pelvis at address
- **Common Error**: Playing "behind" the tush line throughout the swing by maintaining excessive posterior tilt
- **Proper Goal**: Stay "near" the tush line, not rigidly maintaining or excessively moving away from it
- **Natural Movement**: Allow hips to work naturally without forced positioning

### Backswing Hip Action
- **Right Hip Contact**: Trail side (right hip for right-handed golfer) contacts the plane board during backswing
- **Purpose**: Establishes proper hip turn and depth in the backswing
- **Checkpoint**: Right hip should feel pressure against the board at top of backswing

### Transition Phase Mechanics
- **Common Fault**: Creating a "gap" between hips and board in transition
- **Cause**: Excessive "tucking of the rear end" (posterior pelvic tilt)
- **Scientific Context**: Over-rotation of pelvis posteriorly disrupts kinematic sequence
- **Impact**: Disrupts efficient weight transfer and reduces power transfer through impact zone

### Downswing Hip Pattern
- **Lead Hip Action**: As trail leg straightens, lead side (left hip) naturally moves back toward the board
- **Contact Level**: Should come "near" the board, not necessarily slam into it
- **Bilateral Pattern**: As right hip comes off board, left hip approaches it
- **Trail Leg Extension**: Straightening of trail leg facilitates natural lead hip rotation

### Pressure Management
- **Avoid Excessive Force**: Don't slam hips into board - gentle contact or proximity is sufficient
- **"Without Shoving Back"**: Avoid forced, aggressive backward hip thrust
- **Natural Feel**: Movement should feel organic, not manufactured

## Actionable Drills

### Plane Board Hip Contact Drill

**Purpose**: Develop proper hip rotation sequence and maintain appropriate relationship to tush line throughout swing

**Equipment Required**:
- Plane board (alignment board or similar flat surface)
- Can be performed indoors (living room)
- No golf club required for basic drill

**Setup**:
1. Place plane board vertically behind your body
2. Assume golf posture with hips touching or near the board
3. Establish tush line at address (normal posterior tilt)
4. Position board so it contacts both hips at address

**Execution**:

*Backswing Phase*:
1. Turn into backswing while maintaining contact with right hip
2. Feel right hip press into board as you complete backswing rotation
3. Checkpoint: Right hip should maintain or increase pressure against board at top

*Transition Phase*:
1. Begin downswing without allowing excessive gap between hips and board
2. Avoid posterior tilt/tucking motion that pulls hips away from board
3. Focus on maintaining proximity to board (but gap is acceptable)

*Downswing/Impact Phase*:
1. As trail leg straightens, feel lead hip approach the board
2. Right hip should come off board as left hip approaches it
3. Lead hip should come "near" board without forceful contact
4. Complete rotation with natural hip turn

**Success Markers**:
- ✓ Smooth bilateral hip contact pattern (right in backswing, left in downswing)
- ✓ No excessive gap in transition phase
- ✓ Natural feeling movement without forced positioning
- ✓ Trail leg extension coordinates with lead hip rotation
- ✓ Avoiding "shoving back" sensation

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
- Creating large gap in transition due to posterior tilt
- Slamming hips into board with excessive force
- Trying to stay "behind" tush line throughout entire swing
- Forcing hips backward rather than allowing natural rotation
- Maintaining rigid position rather than fluid movement

**Progression Notes**:
- Begin with slow-motion rehearsals
- Can add club once pattern is established
- Focus on feel rather than visual feedback initially
- Video from down-the-line angle to verify hip position

## Key Takeaways

1. **Natural Hip Movement Is Superior**: Forcing specific hip positions is less effective than allowing biomechanically natural movement patterns

2. **Bilateral Hip Contact Pattern**: Proper swing features trail hip contact in backswing transitioning to lead hip contact in downswing

3. **Proximity vs. Rigidity**: Goal is to stay "near" the tush line, not rigidly maintain or avoid it

4. **Avoid Posterior Tilt in Transition**: Common fault of tucking pelvis creates gap and disrupts kinematic sequence

5. **Trail Leg Extension Drives Lead Hip**: Straightening of trail leg naturally facilitates lead hip rotation back toward board

6. **Accessible Training Tool**: Drill can be performed at home without extensive equipment or space

## Related Concepts

- **Kinematic Sequence**: Proper hip movement supports efficient energy transfer from ground up through body
- **Posterior vs. Anterior Pelvic Tilt**: Understanding pelvic orientation throughout swing phases
- **Ground Reaction Forces**: Hip movement patterns coordinate with force application into ground
- **Tush Line Concept**: Reference line for pelvis/hip position throughout swing

## Application Notes

**Skill Level**: Suitable for all levels - simple feedback mechanism makes it accessible to beginners while addressing sophisticated biomechanical concepts

**Training Context**: Ideal for:
- Off-season training
- Indoor practice during inclement weather
- Movement pattern development
- Pre-round warm-up visualization
- Rehabilitation from swing faults related to hip sequencing

**Integration with Practice**: Once pattern is established with board, translate feel to range practice with awareness of hip rotation and weight transfer

**Scientific Perspective**: This drill provides kinesthetic feedback for proper hip sequencing that aligns with biomechanical research on efficient swing patterns, particularly regarding pelvis orientation and bilateral weight transfer patterns.
