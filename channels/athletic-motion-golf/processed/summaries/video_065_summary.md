## Overview

This video reveals exclusive GEARS 3D biomechanics data on internal and external hip rotation patterns in elite golfers - a movement relationship that AMG claims has rarely been shown outside private lessons. Using bird's-eye view tracking of the lead knee, trail knee, and pelvis centers, the video demonstrates how tour-level players create differential rotation between the pelvis and legs, rather than simply "spinning" as a unit. The core discovery: elite players externally rotate the lead hip in the backswing (pelvis turns AWAY from lead knee) and externally rotate the trail hip in the downswing (pelvis turns AWAY from trail knee), creating elastic stretch that powers consistent ball striking. Two amateur examples show how conceptual misunderstandings - not physical limitations - prevent proper sequencing.

## Key Biomechanical Concepts

### The Elite Hip Rotation Pattern (GEARS Data)

**Backswing Sequence:**
- Pelvis rotation quickly OVERTAKES trail knee rotation
- This means: pelvis turns INTO the trail leg (internal rotation at trail hip)
- Simultaneously: pelvis turns AWAY from lead knee (external rotation at lead hip)
- Result: Stretch across the pelvis, with MORE external rotation on lead side than internal on trail side
- At top of swing: Lead leg maintains relatively straight alignment (hip-knee-ankle stacked)

**Downswing Sequence:**
- Both knees rotate toward target immediately (NOT opposite directions)
- Pelvis now pulls AWAY from trail knee (external rotation at trail hip)
- Pelvis OVERTAKES lead knee (internal rotation at lead hip)
- At impact: Pelvis externally rotated away from trail leg, internally rotated into lead leg

**Universal Pattern Among Elite Players:**
- Pro 1: Mid-40s pelvis rotation at top, proper sequencing throughout
- Pro 2: Uses more lateral shift but same rotational pattern
- Key signature: Trail-side internal/lead-side external in backswing, then FLIP in downswing

### What "Internal" and "External" Rotation Actually Mean

**NOT Just Spinning:**
- Traditional teaching: "Turn your hips" (everything moves together)
- Reality: Pelvis rotates at DIFFERENT RATE than femurs (leg bones)
- Internal rotation: Pelvis turns INTO the leg (belt buckle toward kneecap)
- External rotation: Pelvis turns AWAY from leg (belt buckle pulls away from kneecap)

**The Rubber Band Analogy:**
- Imagine two rubber bands attached to pelvis, connected to each femur
- Backswing: Stretch the LEFT rubber band (external rotation lead hip)
- Downswing: Stretch the RIGHT rubber band (external rotation trail hip)
- This creates stored elastic energy and proper sequencing

### Common Pattern Breakdowns (Amateur Examples)

**Problem 1: Pelvis Never Overtakes Lead Knee**
- Symptom: Mid-40s pelvis turn going back, only mid-20s open at impact
- Result: "Imbalanced rotation" - more turn back than through
- Contributing factor: STANCE TOO NARROW (restricts downswing rotation)
- Consequence: Loss of power and consistency

**Problem 2: "Centered Pivot" With No Body Turn**
- Setup: Feet turned inward to prevent sway
- Symptom: Almost all arm swing, minimal body rotation
- At top: MORE internal rotation trail side than external lead side
- Result: No stretch on lead side = weak transition position

**Problem 3: "The Pirouette Move"**
- Symptom: Lead heel spins inward immediately starting down
- Cause: Hanging back on trail foot (not enough lead foot pressure)
- Result: Pelvis never overtakes either knee
- Pattern: Everything turns together in "high-effort, low-power twist"
- Impact: Slow pelvis rotation, loss of clubface control

## The Practical Application (AMG's "Cheat Code")

### Primary Feel: Focus on Lead Hip in Backswing

**Traditional Teaching (Less Effective):**
- Think about internally rotating trail hip
- Focus on "making a big turn"
- Drive knees to create rotation

**AMG Recommended Feel:**
- **Lead leg stays relatively stable** (maintains straightness from face-on view)
- **Turn belt buckle AWAY from lead femur** (external rotation)
- Feel: "Stretch from big toe to hands throughout whole body"
- Still get internal rotation at trail hip, but it happens naturally
- Benefit: Prevents over-backing in (excessive tilt), automatic transition sequence

### Secondary Feel: Focus on Trail Hip in Downswing

**The Stretch Sensation:**
- As you move through impact, focus on stretching belt buckle AWAY from trail leg
- Trail leg should show straighter alignment from face-on (hip-knee-ankle stacked)
- Feel: Tension in trail hip flexor
- Not: Driving trail knee toward target
- Not: Kicking trail leg forward

**What This Fixes:**
- Prevents "overkicking" trail leg then straightening
- Eliminates slack in the system
- Creates proper hand path around body
- Reduces late "buckle" or clubhead flash
- Improves clubface control and start line consistency
- Prevents flippy hooks with high exit

## Actionable Practice Protocol

### Step 1: Film Face-On View

**Setup:**
- Position camera directly in front (down-the-line won't show this)
- Record full swing at normal speed

**Backswing Checkpoints:**
- Lead leg: Look for relatively straight line (hip-knee-ankle aligned)
- DON'T see: Knee kicking forward or backing away significantly
- DON'T force knee position - pull pelvis away from knee instead

**Downswing/Impact Checkpoints:**
- Trail leg: Look for straighter alignment at impact
- Both knees: Should flex properly, not drive excessively
- Body position: More stable, hands and club path more controlled

### Step 2: Practice at Slow Speed Initially

**Critical Learning Protocol:**
- DON'T blast full-speed shots while trying to learn new pattern
- Go at speed where you KNOW you're executing the change
- Many golfers will be tight in hip flexors (may need stretching)
- Build up speed gradually as pattern becomes comfortable

**Practice Progression:**
1. Rehearse motion without ball (slow motion)
2. Chip shots with new feel
3. Half-speed swings
4. Gradually increase to full speed

### Step 3: Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Don't: Force Lead Knee Outward**
- Some players will push lead knee away from target
- This is NOT the goal - it should happen from pelvis movement

**Don't: Turn Feet Inward to "Stay Centered"**
- Restricts necessary rotation
- Forces arms-only swing
- Prevents proper hip rotation pattern

**Don't: Use Narrow Stance**
- Even tall players need adequate width
- Narrow stance may help backswing turn but costs downswing rotation
- Result: Imbalanced rotation (more back than through)

**Don't: Practice While Guessing**
- Use video or go slow enough to feel the movement
- Blasting shots and hoping you did it correctly doesn't create change

## Performance Benefits (Verified by AMG)

### Clubface Control
- Hand path goes around body more naturally
- Less late clubhead flash/buckle
- Eliminates straight start line with overdraw pattern
- Reduces excess face rotation

### Impact Position
- Better balance of rotation (similar degrees back and through)
- More stable body position at impact
- Trail hip flexor engagement creates proper sequencing
- Both knees properly flexed (not driven excessively)

### Transition Sequence
- "Almost automatic" transition from backswing to downswing
- Proper lower body/upper body separation
- Stretch creates elastic rebound effect
- No need to consciously "start" downswing with specific move

### Plane and Path
- Prevents getting "way under plane" in downswing
- Eliminates excessive tilt at top of swing
- Club motion stays on proper path
- Reduces need for compensations

## Key Conceptual Shifts

### 1. It's Conceptual, Not Physical
- Both amateur examples were physically capable of elite pattern
- By end of their GEARS sessions, both were executing correctly
- Understanding WHAT needs to happen unlocks the movement

### 2. Different Than "Spinning Around Like a Top"
- Not about rotating everything together
- Not about maximum rotation degrees
- About DIFFERENTIAL rotation between pelvis and legs
- Creating stretch = creating stored energy

### 3. Focus Shift From Trail to Lead (Backswing)
- Most instruction focuses on trail hip internal rotation
- AMG has better success focusing on lead hip external rotation
- Lead hip focus prevents over-backing in and excessive tilt

### 4. Focus Shift From Legs to Pelvis (Downswing)
- Traditional: Drive knees toward target
- AMG: Pull pelvis away from legs
- Creates proper hip joint work instead of just moving limbs

## Success Markers

**You're Doing It Right When:**
- Feel stretch from lead toe to hands in backswing
- Transition feels automatic (not forced)
- Trail hip flexor engagement in downswing
- More stable body position throughout
- Better clubface control and start line
- Video shows lead leg straight-ish in backswing, trail leg straight-ish at impact
- Exit improves (less high, flippy finish)

**Warning Signs You're Not There Yet:**
- Still kicking trail knee forward in backswing
- Still driving knees aggressively in downswing
- Hanging back on trail foot through impact
- Lead heel spinning inward (pirouette move)
- Club getting under plane
- Inconsistent start lines and excessive draw

## Equipment/Setup Factors

**Stance Width:**
- Don't sacrifice downswing rotation for backswing turn
- Adequate width required for proper sequencing
- Height alone doesn't determine optimal width

**Foot Position:**
- Some foot flare is natural and acceptable
- Avoid turning feet inward excessively
- Must allow for proper rotation in both directions

## AMG's Personal Applications

**Instructor 1 (previously over-backed in):**
- Used to flatten hips and back butt in
- Now focuses on pulling pelvis away from lead leg in backswing
- Eliminates slack and excessive tilt
- Prevents flippy hooks with high exit
- Describes it as finding a "cheat code"

**Instructor 2 (previously overkicked trail leg):**
- History of driving trail knee forward
- Trail leg would straighten early
- Now feels control over clubface for first time
- Hand path works around body properly
- No more late buckle or excess face rotation

## Integration Notes

**This Pattern Enables:**
- Proper pressure shift (can't pirouette if pressure is correct)
- Natural transition sequence
- Clubface consistency
- Power from elastic stretch (not muscular forcing)
- Sustainable, repeatable motion

**This Pattern Requires:**
- Understanding the concept first
- Potentially hip flexor flexibility work
- Patient practice at slower speeds
- Video feedback or kinesthetic awareness
- Adequate stance width
- Proper foot positioning

## Summary

The internal/external rotation pattern revealed in GEARS data shows that elite players don't simply "rotate" as a unit - they create differential rotation between pelvis and legs that generates elastic stretch. The key sequence: lead hip external rotation (pelvis away from lead knee) in backswing, then trail hip external rotation (pelvis away from trail knee) in downswing. By focusing on pulling the belt buckle away from the lead femur going back and away from the trail femur coming through, golfers can access this pattern without needing to think about multiple moving parts. The payoff is automatic transition sequencing, better clubface control, and consistent ball striking. Practice slowly with video feedback until the pattern becomes natural, allowing speed to build gradually. The issue for most amateurs isn't physical capability - it's conceptual understanding of what movement should actually occur.
