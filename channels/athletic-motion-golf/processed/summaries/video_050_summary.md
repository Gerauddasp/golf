## Overview

This short video addresses one of the most common requests from golfers: getting more rotation at impact. The AMG team reveals a counterintuitive truth—trying to force rotation at impact is the wrong approach. Instead, proper rotation is a natural consequence of a correct backswing and proper club positioning on the downswing. Through a real-world case study, they demonstrate how fixing the backswing alone increased a student's impact rotation from 29° to 43° open in just 15 minutes, without any specific instruction to "get open."

## Key Concepts

### The Rotation Paradox
- **Common Request**: "I want to get more rotation at impact"
- **Common Mistake**: Actively trying to force the body open during the downswing
- **Problem Indicator**: Odd compensations with the trail leg that actually prevent rotation
- **AMG Philosophy**: "We never really teach a whole lot of getting open"

### The Causal Chain: Backswing → Downswing → Rotation
1. **Good Backswing** → Club in better position at the top
2. **Good Club Position Downswing** → Body naturally opens
3. **Natural Opening** → Proper rotation at impact

**Why It Works**: If the club is in a good spot coming down, the only way to get it back out in front of you is for your body to naturally open up. Unless you're doing something unnatural with your lower body, this rotation happens automatically.

### The Trail Leg Issue
- When golfers consciously try to rotate more, they often create compensations in the trail leg
- These compensations actually **kill** the ability to rotate properly
- The forced movements are "unnatural" and interfere with the body's natural sequencing

## Real-World Case Study

### The Student's Journey

**Initial State:**
- Backswing: Very closed
- Impact Rotation: 29° open

**Intervention:**
- **Only instruction given**: "We got to get more open at impact by fixing the backswing"
- **No instruction** about rotating, getting open, or changing impact position
- **No lower body cues** or compensatory movements taught

**Results (15 Minutes Later):**
- Impact Rotation: 42-43° open (48% improvement)
- Backswing Position: Improved/fixed
- Method: Changed backswing ONLY

**Increase in Rotation**: 13-14° improvement in pelvic rotation at impact

## Biomechanical Principle

### Rotation as Effect, Not Cause

**The Fundamental Truth**: "Getting open is a result of what happens before it"

- **Sequence Dependency**: Impact position is determined by positions earlier in the swing
- **Natural Movement**: The body will rotate properly if not blocked by poor positions
- **Club Path Drives Body**: The club's position on the downswing dictates how the body must move
- **First Principles**: To change the effect (rotation), you must change the cause (backswing)

### Why Forcing Rotation Fails

1. **Compensatory Pattern**: Creates unnatural lower body movements
2. **Timing Issues**: Disrupts the natural kinematic sequence
3. **Efficiency Loss**: Fighting against biomechanical reality
4. **Inconsistency**: Requires conscious manipulation rather than natural motion

## Diagnostic Framework

### If You Lack Rotation at Impact

**Step 1: Check Your Backswing**
- Is the club in a closed position at the top?
- Is your body position setting up a poor downswing path?

**Step 2: Evaluate Downswing Club Position**
- Is the club approaching from an inside or outside path?
- Is the clubface orientation correct?

**Step 3: Assess for Compensations**
- Are you doing "odd stuff" with your trail leg?
- Are you consciously trying to force rotation?

**The Fix**: Address the backswing first. "That's the first place you got to look."

## Key Takeaways

1. **Stop Trying to Force Rotation**: Conscious attempts to "get open" at impact create compensatory movements that actually prevent proper rotation

2. **Fix the Backswing First**: Proper rotation at impact is a natural consequence of a correct backswing position—this is where diagnosis and correction should begin

3. **Trust the Kinematic Sequence**: If the club is in the right position on the downswing, your body will naturally rotate to get the club back in front of you

4. **Measure What Matters**: Track backswing position, not just impact rotation. The 29° → 43° case study proves that fixing the cause (backswing) automatically fixes the effect (rotation)

5. **Natural Movement Wins**: Work with your body's natural biomechanics rather than forcing positions—remove the obstacles (poor backswing) and rotation happens automatically

## Practical Application

### For Instruction
- Resist the urge to give impact-based rotation cues
- Focus diagnostic effort on backswing quality
- Let rotation improvement be the validation of backswing fixes

### For Practice
- Stop actively thinking about "getting open" during the swing
- Dedicate practice time to backswing mechanics
- Film your backswing position to identify closed or open patterns
- Trust that impact rotation will improve as backswing improves

### For On-Course
- Mental cue should be about backswing position, not impact rotation
- Trust the process—if backswing is sound, rotation will happen
- Avoid mid-round compensations with lower body trying to force rotation

## AMG Scientific Insight

This video exemplifies AMG's data-driven, causality-focused approach to instruction. Rather than treating the symptom (lack of rotation), they identify and fix the root cause (backswing position). The 48% improvement in just 15 minutes with a single focus area demonstrates the power of understanding swing biomechanics and the kinematic sequence. The lesson: rotation at impact is not a position to achieve but rather an inevitable consequence of correct earlier positions.
