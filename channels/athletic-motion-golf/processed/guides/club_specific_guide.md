## Introduction: Club-Specific Biomechanics {#introduction}

### Why Different Clubs Require Different Approaches

While the fundamental golf swing pattern remains similar across all clubs, **specific biomechanical adjustments** are necessary for optimal performance with different club types.

**Key Variables:**
1. **Club Length:** Affects swing plane, arc width, timing requirements
2. **Loft:** Determines optimal angle of attack and ball position
3. **Ball Position:** Influences shoulder alignment and attack angle
4. **Shaft Lean:** Varies dramatically between driver (0-2°) and irons (8°)
5. **Attack Angle:** Ranges from +5° (driver) to -4° (short irons)

**AMG Principle:**
Understanding these differences prevents harmful "one swing fits all" approach that destroys consistency across the bag.

---

## Driver {#driver}

### Biomechanical Setup

**Ball Position:**
- Forward in stance (inside lead heel or further forward)
- Allows ascending blow
- Positions shoulders properly for upward attack

**Spine Tilt:**
- MORE side tilt than irons
- Trail shoulder significantly lower than lead
- Necessary for positive attack angle
- Creates proper shoulder alignment

**Weight Distribution:**
- Slight lead-side bias acceptable (55-60%)
- NOT hanging back on trail side
- Maintains dynamic balance

### Impact Requirements

**Shaft Lean Reality** (Video 75):
- **Critical Difference:** Driver needs 0-2° forward shaft lean MAXIMUM
- **Iron Comparison:** Irons use ~8° forward lean
- **Modern Instruction Problem:** Forward lean emphasis improves irons but creates disasters with driver
- **Symptoms of Excessive Lean:** Blocks (face can't square), low hooks (over-compensation)

**Attack Angle:**
- **Optimal:** +3 to +5° ascending (hitting up on ball)
- **TrackMan Data:** Tour average varies by player type
- **Slower Swingers:** More upward preferred (+4 to +5°)
- **Faster Swingers:** Can use less (+2 to +3°)

**Lead Shoulder Position** (Video 41):
- At or slightly BEHIND setup position at impact
- NOT forward like with irons
- This is KEY difference for attack angle
- Forward shoulder = descending blow = distance loss

### Common Driver Issues

**Handle Too Deep** (Video 72):
- **Problem:** Handle gets too far in front with shaft parallel
- **Creates:** Geometry problem forcing backing out
- **18-Wheeler Analogy:** Need to turn corner early
- **Solution:** Deliver club earlier with "tickling grass" feel
- **Result:** Gives long arc time to properly sequence, vertical shaft at impact

**Pull-Twist Pattern** (Video 79):
- **Problem:** Excessive handle pulling + late face rotation
- **Creates:** Timing-dependent inconsistency
- **Diagnostic:** Vertical alignment stick at ball position
- **Reality:** Forward ball position + long shaft require different mechanics

**Applying Iron Mechanics** (Video 75):
- **Issue:** Players improving iron play (shaft lean) apply same to driver
- **Result:** Disaster - blocks, low hooks, inconsistency
- **Fix:** Understand driver needs different impact conditions

### Driver Swing Thoughts

**Geometry & Timing** (Video 72):
- "18-wheeler turning corner" feel
- Deliver earlier than irons
- "Tickling grass" through impact zone
- Let long arc complete

**Give It Time** (Video 74):
- **Geometric Principle:** Larger circles need more time than smaller circles
- Longer club = larger arc = more time required
- Don't rush transition
- Slight pause at top beneficial

**Width Feel**:
- Wide backswing arc
- Maintain distance from body
- Rectangle shape preserved
- Shoulder retraction active

### Driver Practice Drills

1. **Vertical Shaft Checkpoint**:
   - Alignment stick at ball position
   - Verify swing allows vertical shaft at impact
   - Tests if mechanics suit driver geometry
   - Immediate feedback

2. **Tickle the Grass Feel**:
   - Practice sweeps without ball
   - Shallow attack angle
   - Ascending blow feel
   - Brushing turf lightly

3. **Time the Arc**:
   - Slow motion swings
   - Feel larger circle requirement
   - Pause at top practice
   - Build patience in transition

---

## Fairway Woods {#fairway-woods}

### Attack Angle Requirements

**TrackMan Tour Data** (Video 71):
- **PGA Tour Average:** 0° (zero) attack angle
- **Range:** Maybe 1-2° down for some players
- **Faster Swingers:** 2-3° down but still relatively neutral
- **Key Point:** NOT a descending blow like irons

**Contact Feel:**
- "Barely tickle the grass"
- Brush the sole
- Zero or near-zero attack angle
- Sweeping motion

**Impact Location on Face:**
- Just above bottom groove
- Not equator (too high)
- Not bottom groove (too low)
- Optimal launch conditions

### Common Fairway Wood Faults

**Topping** (Video 67):
- **Root Cause:** Trying to hit down like irons
- **Attack Angle Issue:** Too steep for fairway wood design
- **Weight Transfer:** Similar to other topping causes

**Inconsistent Contact** (Video 76):
- Varying attack angle
- Arc width inconsistency
- Low point control issues

**"Helping It Up"** (Videos 67, 76):
- **Error:** Scooping to get ball airborne
- **Reality:** Loft does the work
- **Need:** Neutral sweep, not lift

### Fairway Wood Solutions

**Tee Clipping Drill** (Videos 67, 76):
- **Setup:** Place tee flat on ground (practice mat ideal)
- **Execution:** Sweep tee cleanly off turf without breaking it
- **Feedback:** Instant and clear
  - Broken tee = too steep (hitting down)
  - Missed tee = topped (too shallow or rising)
  - Clean clip = perfect
- **Practice:** 10-20 reps before hitting balls

**Wide Arc Emphasis** (Video 76):
- Fairway woods need WIDER arc than irons
- More sweep than chop
- Maintain width longer
- Rectangle preservation

**Mental Cue** (Video 67):
- "Sweep it—pretend the tee's still there"
- Use when hitting actual shots
- Reinforces proper feel
- Prevents reverting to descending blow

**Simple Tip** (Video 74):
- Give club TIME to complete arc
- Larger circle than irons/wedges
- Pause at top beneficial
- Don't rush transition

**PGA Tour Secret** (Video 71):
- Zero attack angle
- Brush sole through impact
- Trust loft to elevate ball
- Neutral arc bottom positioning

### Why Tour Players Prefer Fairway Woods

**Trend:** Increasingly favor fairway woods over long irons

**Reasons:**
- More forgiving on attack angle
- Larger sweet spot
- Better from various lies
- Easier to achieve neutral attack angle consistently

---

## Hybrids {#hybrids}

*Note: Limited hybrid-specific instruction in the 92 videos analyzed. Hybrids generally follow fairway wood principles with slightly more descending blow acceptable (0 to -2°).*

**General Approach:**
- Closer to fairway wood than iron technique
- Neutral to slightly descending attack angle
- Forward ball position (slightly behind fairway wood)
- Sweep with minimal divot

---

## Irons {#irons}

### Impact Requirements

**Shaft Lean** (Videos 41, 58, 75):
- **Optimal:** ~8° forward shaft lean at impact
- **Purpose:** Compresses ball, creates penetrating flight
- **Delofting Effect:** Dynamic loft less than static loft
- **Critical:** This is BYPRODUCT of proper mechanics, not conscious creation

**Shaft Lean Myth** (Video 46):
- **Popular Drill:** Shaft extension drill (prevent stick hitting side)
- **Problem:** Teaches pulling arms across for shaft lean
- **Reality:** AMG never discusses shaft lean in lessons
- **Truth:** Focus on proper mechanics, shaft lean appears naturally

**Ball-First Contact:**
- Contact ball before ground
- Divot in FRONT of ball
- Descending blow required
- Compression achieved

**Lead Shoulder Position** (Video 41):
- **Critical:** 2-2.5 inches FORWARD of setup position at impact
- **Differs from Driver:** Driver has shoulder at/behind setup
- **Creates:** Proper descending angle of attack
- **Measurement:** Specific to irons for compression

### Attack Angle

**By Iron Type:**
- **Long Irons (4-6):** -3 to -4° attack angle
- **Mid Irons (7-8):** -4 to -5° attack angle
- **Short Irons (9-PW):** -5 to -6° attack angle

**Divot Pattern:**
- Forward of ball
- Consistent depth
- Direction matches target line
- Width appropriate for club

**Common Error:**
+3° attack angle with 7-iron = WRONG pattern (too shallow/ascending like driver)

### Iron Swing Mechanics

**Upper Body Position:**
- Body must shift forward
- Lead shoulder 2-2.5" ahead
- NOT behind like driver
- Creates descending blow geometry

**Weight Transfer:**
- 85-95% on lead side at impact
- More forward than driver
- Earlier in downswing
- Creates consistent low point

**Release:**
- Three wrist movements required (Video 58):
  1. Ulnar deviation (uncocking)
  2. Supination (rotation)
  3. Extension
- Body rotation contribution minimal
- Wrist action creates clubface rotation (45-65°)

### Iron Drills

**Video Analysis with Vertical Line** (Video 41):
- Draw line from lead shoulder at address
- Check position at impact
- Should be 2-2.5" forward
- Down-the-line view required

**Buddy Finger Drill** (Video 41):
- Partner provides reference point
- Kinesthetic feedback
- Feel upper body moving forward
- Build proper pattern

**"Just Do It" Drill** (Video 41):
- Active self-correction
- Feel the shift forward consciously
- Progressive integration
- On-course position check

**Divot Pattern Monitoring**:
- Should be in front of ball
- Consistent direction
- Appropriate depth
- Forward shaft lean evidence

---

## Wedges {#wedges}

### Full Swing Wedges

**Shaft Lean:**
- Similar to irons (~8° forward lean)
- Maximum compression
- Spin generation
- Penetrating ball flight

**Attack Angle:**
- Steepest of any club (-5 to -6°)
- Deepest divots
- Ball-first contact critical
- Significant forward weight

**Distance Control:**
- Consistent tempo primary factor
- Progressive speed integration
- Same mechanics, varying speeds
- Club selection over swing manipulation

### Partial Wedges

**Connection Drill Caveat** (Video 42):
- **When It Works:** Partial wedge shots
- **Setup:** Towel/headcover under trail arm
- **Application:** Short pitches, punch shots
- **WARNING:** Harmful when applied to full swings
- **Problem:** Restricts necessary trail arm elevation for full swings

---

## Chipping {#chipping}

### Chip vs Pitch Definition (Video 93)

**AMG Classification System:**

**Number One (Chip Shot):**
- **Purpose:** Maximum roll, minimum air time
- **Setup:**
  - Hands high (even with/above trail thigh)
  - Face square to slightly shut
  - Narrow stance
  - Ball back of center
- **Backswing:**
  - Straight back low to ground
  - Minimal wrist hinge
  - "Putting stroke with loft"
- **Release:**
  - Minimal to none
  - Low hands through impact
  - Abbreviated follow-through
- **Result:**
  - Low trajectory
  - Releases and rolls like putt
  - Predictable distance control

**Number Two (Pitch Shot):**
- See Pitching section below

### Low Chip Shot Technique (Video 70)

**When to Use:**
- Very tight lie
- Need absolute minimum height
- Running up to hole
- Minimal green to work with

**Setup Modifications:**
- **Ball Position:** Back in stance
- **Stance Width:** Narrow (one club width between heels)
- **Lead Toe:** Out 45 degrees
- **Distance:** Stand only ONE FOOT from ball (elevates handle significantly)

**Swing Mechanics:**
- Forward body press on backswing
- Shut face angle from closer proximity
- NO-release motion through impact
- Leading edge contact (NOT bounce)

**Key Distinction:**
This is more extreme than standard chip—use for specific situations requiring absolute minimum trajectory.

### Chipping Drills

**Setup Positioning Drill** (Video 70):
1. Practice narrow stance
2. Get close to ball (one foot)
3. Elevated hands position
4. Lead toe out 45°

**Forward Press Body Motion** (Video 70):
- Slight forward press on backswing
- Maintains shaft lean through impact
- Prevents flip/scoop
- Low trajectory result

**No-Release Impact Drill** (Video 70):
- Practice impact position
- Minimal wrist rotation
- Sustained lean
- Lead edge contact

**Tempo Matching** (Video 94):
- **Critical for Consistency:** Match backswing and downswing speeds
- **Common Errors:**
  - Slow/short backswing → over-acceleration
  - Fast/long backswing → deceleration
- **Solution:** Feel equal speeds throughout

---

## Pitching {#pitching}

### Number Two Pitch Shot (Video 93)

**Purpose:**
- Higher trajectory
- More spin
- Soft landing
- Less roll than chip

**Setup:**
- **Hands:** Lower than chip (normal height)
- **Face:** Open (more loft exposure)
- **Stance:** Slightly wider than chip
- **Ball Position:** Center to slightly forward

**Backswing:**
- **Path:** Toe-up and AROUND (not straight back)
- **Wrist Action:** Allow natural hinging
- **Arc:** More rounded than chip
- **Body Rotation:** More active than chip

**Impact:**
- **Body Extension:** Critical for spin generation
- **Release:** More active than chip
- **Bounce Utilization:** Slide under ball
- **Face Control:** Maintain loft

**Result:**
- Higher launch
- More backspin
- Shorter roll
- Softer landing

### Flop Shots (Video 95)

**The "Cheat Code": Long & Slow Tempo**

**Primary Factor:**
NOT the open face (secondary) - it's the TEMPO

**Critical Technique:**
- **Backswing:** Long AND slow
- **Downswing:** Maintain slow tempo
- **Mechanism:** Allows club to slide cleanly under ball
- **Result:** Near-vertical launch with minimal roll

**Setup:**
- Face open (but tempo is more important)
- Weight favoring lead side
- Ball position slightly forward

**Swing Feel:**
- Exaggerated slow motion
- Long, flowing arc
- Complete finish
- Trust tempo to create height

### Pitching Drills

**Toe-Up Awareness Drill** (Video 93):
- Practice toe-up position in backswing
- Feel club rotating around
- Not straight back
- Builds proper arc pattern

**Straight Back vs Around Comparison** (Video 93):
- Alternate between chip (straight) and pitch (around)
- Feel the difference
- Understand why each works
- Match technique to shot requirements

**Long & Slow Flop Practice** (Video 95):
- Tempo exaggeration drill
- Build kinesthetic awareness
- Progressive speed reduction
- Trust mechanism

**Spin Production Validation** (Video 93):
- Practice Number Two technique
- Verify spin creation
- Body extension emphasis
- Measure results

## Short Game: Chip vs Pitch Decision Matrix

| Situation | Recommended Shot | Why |
|-----------|-----------------|-----|
| Tight lie, little green | Low chip (Video 70) | Minimum trajectory, maximum control |
| Fringe, lots of green | Standard chip (Number One) | Roll like putt, predictable |
| Need to carry bunker/rough | Pitch (Number Two) | Height + spin required |
| Tight pin, fast green | Flop (Video 95) | Soft landing, minimal roll |
| Uphill to pin | Chip preferred | Let slope slow ball naturally |
| Downhill to pin | Pitch/flop | Need spin to hold green |

### Short Game Consistency (Video 94)

**Universal Principle:**

Match backswing and downswing speeds for consistent contact and distance control.

**Tempo Errors:**
1. Slow/short back → over-acceleration down = inconsistent distance
2. Fast/long back → deceleration down = chunking, poor contact

**Solution:**
Equal speeds throughout motion = solid contact + predictable distance

---

## Bunker Play {#bunker}

*Note: Minimal bunker-specific instruction in the 92 videos analyzed. AMG focus primarily on full swing mechanics.*

**General Principles:**
- Open face for bounce utilization
- Ball forward in stance
- Contact sand before ball
- Follow-through essential
- Speed through sand (not deceleration)

---

## Putting {#putting}

*Note: Very limited putting instruction in the 92 videos analyzed. AMG primary focus is full swing biomechanics and ball-striking.*

**General Principles:**
- Face aim most critical factor
- Tempo consistency
- Solid contact (sweet spot)
- Read green accurately

---

## Club Selection Strategy

### When Club Choice Matters

**Long Approach Shots:**
- **Modern Trend:** Fairway woods over long irons
- **Reason:** More forgiving on attack angle errors
- **Why It Works:** Easier to achieve neutral/slightly descending consistently
- **Tour Example:** Increasing prevalence on tour

**Short Approaches:**
- Match technique to shot requirement:
  - Maximum roll = Chip (Number One)
  - Need height = Pitch (Number Two)
  - Soft landing = Flop technique
- Don't force one method for all situations

**Distance Gaps:**
- Consider attack angle differences
- Driver vs 3-wood may have similar carry
- Iron gapping affects by attack angle consistency
- Wedge gapping critical for scoring

## Troubleshooting by Club

### Driver Issues

**Symptom:** Blocks or low hooks
- **Likely Cause:** Too much forward shaft lean (Video 75)
- **Fix:** Vertical shaft at impact, not forward lean

**Symptom:** Inconsistent with good iron play
- **Likely Cause:** Applying iron mechanics to driver
- **Fix:** Understand driver-specific requirements

**Symptom:** Loss of distance despite solid contact
- **Likely Cause:** Descending blow vs ascending
- **Fix:** Lead shoulder position, attack angle

### Fairway Wood Issues

**Symptom:** Topping frequently
- **Likely Cause:** Hitting down like irons (Video 67)
- **Fix:** Tee clipping drill for zero attack angle

**Symptom:** Inconsistent contact
- **Likely Cause:** Variable attack angle (Video 76)
- **Fix:** Tee clipping drill on practice mat

**Symptom:** No distance difference from long irons
- **Likely Cause:** Same descending blow with both
- **Fix:** Learn neutral sweep for fairway woods

### Iron Issues

**Symptom:** Thin contact, no divot
- **Likely Cause:** Lead shoulder not forward enough (Video 41)
- **Fix:** Upper body shift, lead shoulder 2-2.5" ahead

**Symptom:** Good contact but low ball flight
- **Likely Cause:** Positive attack angle (too shallow)
- **Fix:** +3° with 7-iron is wrong—need descending

**Symptom:** Fat shots
- **Likely Cause:** Scooping, early release (Video 92)
- **Fix:** Impact bag drill, trail hip rotation

### Short Game Issues

**Symptom:** Inconsistent distance control
- **Likely Cause:** Tempo mismatch (Video 94)
- **Fix:** Match backswing/downswing speeds

**Symptom:** Wrong trajectory for situation
- **Likely Cause:** Using chip when pitch needed (or vice versa)
- **Fix:** Technique selection based on shot requirements (Video 93)

**Symptom:** Thin/fat chips
- **Likely Cause:** Helping it up or decelerating
- **Fix:** Forward press, no-release motion (Video 70 for low chips)

## Advanced Concepts

### The Secret Difference (Video 75)

**Critical Understanding:**
The problem with applying one swing to all clubs isn't just attack angle—it's **shaft lean at impact**.

**Why This Matters:**
- Driver with 8° forward lean = DISASTER
- Iron with 0° lean = weak, inconsistent
- Must adjust feel for different clubs
- Same swing pattern, different impact conditions

### Arc Size & Timing (Video 74)

**Geometric Principle:**
Larger swing circles (longer clubs) require more TIME than smaller circles (shorter clubs).

**Practical Application:**
- Driver/fairway woods: Need more time, slight pause beneficial
- Mid irons: Moderate timing
- Wedges: Can be quicker, more compact

**Don't Rush Transition:**
Especially with longer clubs—let backswing complete fully before starting downswing.

### Club-Specific Feels

**Driver:**
- "Tickle the grass"
- "18-wheeler turning corner"
- "Give it time"
- Wide arc sensation

**Fairway Woods:**
- "Sweep the tee"
- "Barely brush grass"
- "Tee still there"
- Neutral arc bottom

**Irons:**
- "Ball then divot"
- "Trap it"
- "Compress"
- "Lean into it" (subtle)

**Chips:**
- "Putt with loft"
- "Hands high"
- "Straight back low"

**Pitches:**
- "Around and up"
- "Extend through"
- "Slide under"

**Flops:**
- "Long and slow"
- "Let it slide"
- "Soft hands"
