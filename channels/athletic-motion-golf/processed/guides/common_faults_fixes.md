## Ball Flight Issues

### Slice {#slice}

**Symptoms:**
- Ball starts relatively straight, curves significantly right (RH golfer)
- Weak, high ball flight
- Significant loss of distance
- Unpredictable curvature amount

**Root Causes:**

1. **Face Open Relative to Path** (Primary cause)
   - Clubface angle at impact doesn't match swing path
   - Path may be fine, but face is open

2. **Grip Issues** (Videos 53, 90)
   - Lead hand heel pad misplaced
   - Trail thumb positioned on top (excessive leverage)
   - Promotes open face through impact

3. **Loss of Width / Lawnmower Move** (Video 6)
   - Collapsing into turn
   - Hands too close to body
   - Forces steep, outside path

4. **Poor Release** (Videos 56, 58)
   - Insufficient forearm rotation
   - Grip security issues preventing proper release
   - Body rotation alone cannot square face

**Solutions:**

**Hanger Drill** (Video 25):
- Use hanger training aid for tactile feedback
- Learn proper forearm rotation pattern
- BB pellet component teaches release timing
- Natural body rotation with proper wrist action

**Grip Correction** (Videos 53, 90):
- Behind-the-back grip method
- Finger-base placement (not palm)
- Proper heel pad position on top of grip
- Trail thumb placement correction

**Width Maintenance** (Video 6):
- Shoulder retraction drill (30-35°)
- Rectangle maintenance between arms/shoulders
- Chest-high backswing checkpoint
- Prevent collapsing into turn

**Release Training** (Video 58):
- Three wrist movements: ulnar deviation, supination, extension
- Focus on supination (forearm rotation)
- 45-65° rotation required in milliseconds
- Cannot rely on body rotation alone

---

### Hook {#hook}

**Symptoms:**
- Ball starts straight or right, curves sharply left
- Sometimes with good distance but unpredictable
- Can be "snap hook" (sudden, severe left)

**Root Causes:**

1. **Face Closed Relative to Path**
   - Too much forearm rotation
   - Timing issue with release
   - Path may be correct but face too closed

2. **Pelvis Over-Rotation** (Video 19)
   - Excessive pelvis rotation in backswing
   - Creates forward bend at top
   - Leads to backward tilt at impact
   - Results in blocks AND hooks

3. **Inside Path with Closed Face**
   - Club approaching too much from inside
   - Combined with closed face at impact
   - Often from "swing inside-out" over-correction

**Solutions:**

**Split-Stance Drill** (Video 19):
- Lead foot aligned with trail heel
- Restricts excessive pelvis rotation
- Focus on internal hip rotation
- Maintain weight retention on trail side

**Path Monitoring**:
- Film down-the-line
- Check club path relative to body
- Ensure not excessively inside-out
- Balance with proper face control

**Release Timing**:
- May need to delay rotation slightly
- Grip security check (Video 57)
- Ensure not manipulating face closed
- Natural release pattern vs forced rotation

---

### Pull {#pull}

**Symptoms:**
- Ball starts left of target, flies straight (no curve)
- Often solid contact and good distance
- Directionally frustrating

**Root Causes:**

1. **Missing Arm Lowering** (Video 33)
   - Not lowering lead arm during transition
   - Should lower along shirt seam angle
   - Creates outside-in path
   - Face square to path = pull

2. **Laid-Off at Top** (Videos 37, 45)
   - Club pointing right of target at top
   - Often from takeaway pause drill
   - Creates pull compensation in downswing
   - Club "tips out" over hands

3. **Shoulders Open Too Early**
   - Upper body leading rotation
   - Pelvis not initiating properly
   - Kinematic sequence reversed

**Solutions:**

**Shirt Seam Arm Lowering Drill** (Video 33):
- Lower lead arm along natural angle toward rib cage
- Coordinate with body rotation
- Automatic shaft shallowing results
- No forced manipulation needed

**Static Arm Lowering Awareness**:
- Practice motion without club
- Feel proper path
- Build kinesthetic pattern
- Integrate slowly with full swing

**Takeaway Correction** (Videos 37, 45):
- Avoid pause at takeaway
- Continuous motion preferred
- Proper plane from start
- Prevents laid-off compensation

---

### Push {#push}

**Symptoms:**
- Ball starts right, flies straight
- Often with driver
- Good contact but directionally off

**Root Causes:**

1. **Shaft Lean with Driver** (Video 75)
   - Too much forward shaft lean at impact
   - Appropriate for irons (8°) but disastrous with driver
   - Driver needs 0-2° maximum
   - Blocks face from squaring

2. **Path Too Inside-Out**
   - Swing path excessively from inside
   - Face square to path = push
   - Often from over-correction of slice

3. **Late Release**
   - Holding face open too long
   - Insufficient rotation
   - Timing issue

**Solutions:**

**Driver-Specific Feel** (Video 72):
- "18-wheeler turning corner" thought
- Deliver club earlier
- "Tickling the grass" sensation
- Allow larger arc time to sequence

**Shaft Lean Awareness** (Video 75):
- Different for driver vs irons
- Driver: vertical shaft at impact
- Avoid "trapping" with driver
- Distinct feels for different clubs

**Release Timing**:
- May need earlier rotation
- Check grip security (Video 57)
- Ensure proper forearm rotation
- Natural vs forced timing

---

### Block {#block}

**Symptoms:**
- Starts right, stays right, weak trajectory
- Loss of distance
- Feel of incomplete follow-through

**Root Causes:**

1. **Pelvis Over-Rotation + Shaft Lean** (Videos 19, 75)
   - Excessive backswing pelvis rotation
   - Combined with forward shaft lean
   - Face can't square properly
   - Geometry prevents proper release

2. **Early Extension Blocking Rotation**
   - Pelvis thrust toward target line
   - Prevents continued rotation
   - Stalls turn through impact

3. **Stuck Position**
   - Arms trapped behind body
   - Trail femur position issue (Video 55)
   - Cannot release club properly

**Solutions:**

**Split-Stance Drill** (Video 19):
- Restrict excessive backswing rotation
- Internal hip rotation focus
- Prevent forward bend at top
- Maintains proper sequencing capability

**Early Extension Fix** (Video 73):
- Backswing problem, not downswing
- "3 forward, 3 back" principle
- Lead femur management
- Trail hip counterbalance

**Trail Femur Position** (Video 55):
- Knee at or just inside ankle (limit)
- Wall drill for tactile feedback
- Joint stacking relationship
- Prevents "stuck" position

---

## Contact Problems

### Topping {#topping}

**Symptoms:**
- Contact above ball's equator
- Weak, low ball flight
- Significant distance loss
- Often with fairway woods

**Root Causes:**

1. **Weight Stuck on Trail Foot** (Video 12)
   - Weight remains on trail side at impact
   - Arms pulled inward
   - Low point behind ball
   - Rising into impact

2. **Helping It Up / Scooping** (Video 67)
   - Trying to lift ball
   - Incorrect angle of attack (fairway woods)
   - Rising through impact zone
   - Early wrist uncocking

3. **Incorrect Low Point** (Fairway Woods)
   - Too steep for fairway woods
   - Need zero attack angle
   - Trying to "hit down" like irons

**Solutions:**

**Forward Hip Shift Drill** (Video 12):
- Lead hip shifts forward during downswing
- Transfer weight from trail to lead foot
- Proper ground contact results
- Solid compression achieved

**Tee Clipping Drill** (Video 67):
- Place tee flat on ground
- Sweep cleanly off turf
- Zero attack angle for fairway woods
- "Barely tickle the grass" feel

**Weight Transfer Training**:
- 80-90% lead side at impact
- Progressive shift through downswing
- Lead leg bracing
- Proper low point forward of ball

---

### Fat Shots {#fat-shots}

**Symptoms:**
- Contact ground before ball
- Divot behind ball
- Significant loss of distance
- Heavy feel at impact

**Root Causes:**

1. **Scooping / Early Release** (Video 92)
   - Wrist uncocking too early
   - Trying to "help" ball up
   - Low point too far back
   - Club bottoming out early

2. **Weight Hanging Back**
   - Similar to topping cause
   - Low point not shifting forward
   - Trail side dominant at impact

3. **Posture Loss**
   - Standing up or backing away
   - Changes arc bottom
   - Inconsistent low point

**Solutions:**

**Impact Bag Drill** (Video 92):
- **Primary Focus:** Trail hip rotation delivery
- Body-driven vs arm-pull
- Proper rotation through impact
- Hip-led movement pattern

**Grip Twist Component** (Video 92):
- Secondary focus on face control
- Twist grip through impact
- Squares face with shaft lean
- Prevents scoop

**Weight Transfer**:

- Lead side dominance at impact
- Proper low point location
- Consistent bottom positioning

---

### Thin Shots {#thin-shots}

**Symptoms:**
- Contact on or just above equator
- Lower than desired trajectory
- Acceptable distance sometimes
- Inconsistent results

**Root Causes:**

1. **Minor Version of Topping Issues**
   - Weight distribution
   - Low point control
   - Arc bottom position

2. **Early Extension**
   - Rising through impact
   - Changes club-ground relationship
   - Arc shallows at wrong time

3. **Setup Drift**
   - Imperceptible changes accumulate
   - Ball position relative to stance
   - Distance from ball
   - Spine angle

**Solutions:**

**Setup Monitoring** (Video 99):
- Constant verification essential
- Imperceptible drifts sabotage swing
- Video documentation
- Return to baseline regularly

**Low Point Control**:
- Tee drills for feedback
- Forward weight at impact
- Lead leg bracing
- Consistent arc bottom

---

### Toe Hits {#toe-hits}

**Symptoms:**
- Contact on toe of clubface
- Distance loss
- Offline direction
- Uncomfortable feel

**Root Causes:**

1. **Loss of Posture**
   - Standing up through impact
   - Usually compensatory
   - Arc shifts away from ball

2. **Arms Extending Too Early**
   - Pushing away from body
   - Arc widening at wrong time
   - Often from casting

3. **Setup Too Close**
   - Starting position issue
   - Compensation creates toe contact

**Solutions:**

**Foot Spray Feedback** (Video 87):
- Dr. Scholes foot spray on clubface
- Immediate visual feedback
- Spray → hit 3-5 shots → analyze pattern
- Adjust based on contact location

**Posture Maintenance**:

---

### Heel Hits {#heel-hits}

**Symptoms:**
- Contact on heel of clubface
- Significant distance loss
- Often causes hosel contact (shanks)
- Very offline

**Root Causes:**

1. **Early Extension** (Video 73)
   - Pelvis moving toward ball
   - Brings clubface closer to body
   - Arc shifts toward heel
   - 99.99% originates in backswing

2. **Lead Elbow Driving Forward** (Video 30)
   - Pushing elbow out in front
   - Brings entire club closer
   - Prevents proper delivery

3. **Setup Too Far**
   - Starting too far from ball
   - Reaching at impact
   - Compensation pattern

**Solutions:**

**Early Extension Fix** (Video 73):

- Lead femur management
- "3 forward, 3 back" principle
- Lead knee position test
- Depth gauge training (foam roller at toes)

**Elbow Path Correction** (Video 30):
- Simply lower arm to side (shirt seam)
- NOT driving forward
- Trail arm reconnection
- Proper delivery path

**Setup Optimization**:
- Find optimal distance
- Arms hang naturally
- No reaching required
- Neutral starting position

## Swing Faults

### Casting / Early Release {#casting}

**Symptoms:**
- Loss of lag angle
- Wrists uncocking too early in downswing
- Loss of power and compression
- Inconsistent contact

**Root Causes:**

**THE KEY INSIGHT: Casting originates in the BACKSWING (Video 80)**

1. **Trail Arm Lowering Instead of Lifting** (Video 80)
   - **Segment-to-Segment Analysis:** Arms lower relative to torso in backswing
   - Elite pattern: Increase 40-45° arm-torso angle
   - Amateurs: Decrease this angle = casting inevitable
   - Counter-intuitive: Arms can lower relative to torso while club appears to rise

2. **Grip Issues** (Video 53)
   - Three primary grip faults promote casting:
     1. Lead hand heel pad misplacement
     2. Trail thumb "glide-off" ("air in grip")
     3. Trail thumb on top (excessive leverage)

3. **Trail Arm Not Reconnecting** (Video 61)
   - Large gap between trail elbow and rib cage at transition
   - Maintains arm bend WITHOUT reconnecting to torso
   - Club "jack knifes" down
   - Two movements required: reconnect then extend

4. **Wrist/Grip Security** (Video 56)
   - Loose grip allows early release
   - Lack of delayed wrist set
   - Missing "float" at transition

**Solutions:**

**Split-Hands Drill** (Video 80):
- **Primary Fix:** Grip shoulder-width apart in backswing
- Forces proper arm lift (makes lowering impossible)
- Slide hands together at top
- Creates later release automatically
- Immediate feedback

**Head Circle Checkpoint** (Butch Harmon):
- Hands stay outside imaginary circle around head at top
- Visible space between head and hands = correct
- Hands behind/inside circle = arms lowered = casting coming

**Grip Correction Drills** (Video 53):
1. **Heel Pad Placement Drill:** Proper position on top of grip
2. **Trail Thumb Security Drill:** Prevent glide-off
3. **Thumb Position Check:** Not on top of grip

**Trail Arm Reconnection** (Video 61):
- **Checkpoint:** Trail elbow near rib cage at transition
- Practice position holds
- Feel reconnection before extension
- Eliminate visible gap

**The Float** (Video 56):
- Grip security first (firm but mobile)
- Delayed wrist set (natural hinging)
- Club finishes backswing while body starts downswing
- Lag retention through proper sequencing

---

### Steep Downswing / Over the Top {#steep-downswing}

**Symptoms:**
- Outside-in swing path
- Pull or pull-slice ball flight
- Divots pointing left
- Inconsistent contact

**Root Causes:**

1. **Bow Wrist "Fix" Makes It Worse** (Video 37)
   - Common advice: Bow lead wrist at top to shallow
   - Actually creates LAID-OFF position
   - Laid-off = forced to pull and steepen in downswing
   - Opposite of intended effect

2. **Backswing Mistiming: "Up Early, In Late"** (Video 51)
   - Adding depth too early in backswing
   - Should delay moving arms across until lead arm parallel
   - Early depth = late flop = club tumbles = steep
   - Proper timing creates automatic shallowing

3. **Sam Burns Setup Flaw** (Video 59)
   - Body twisted left/open at address
   - Trail forearm elevated
   - Creates outside takeaway
   - Laid-off top → steep downswing

4. **Missing Rotation Prerequisites** (Video 16)
   - Three requirements before adding rotation:
     1. Slack in transition (not maxed out)
     2. Proper clubface position
     3. Arms working down (not left behind)
   - Without these, rotation makes steepness worse

**Solutions:**

**Forearm Rotation Awareness** (Video 37):
- Natural wrist angles (not bowing/cupping manipulation)
- Club-behind-back grip training
- Club-on-shoulder punch drill
- Alignment stick across forearm

**"Up Early, In Late" Pattern** (Video 51):
- **Checkpoint:** Down-the-line at lead arm parallel
- Hands should NOT be deep yet
- Elbow-shoulder-C7 angle maintained
- Delay moving arms across
- Results in automatic shallowing

**Setup Correction** (Video 59):
- Square hips and shoulders
- Level forearms at address
- Trail forearm not elevated
- Neutral body alignment

**Rotation Prerequisites Check** (Video 16):
- Verify slack exists at top
- Clubface on top of shaft
- Arms able to work down while body rotates
- Bracketing practice (steep → shallow → middle)

**Weighted One-Handed Club Drill** (Video 51):
- Forces proper loading
- Cannot flip or tumble club
- Teaches proper depth timing
- Build to full swing

---

### Early Extension {#early-extension}

**Symptoms:**
- Hips thrust toward ball in downswing
- Loss of spine angle
- Standing up through impact
- Compensations required for contact

**Root Causes:**

**CRITICAL INSIGHT: 99.99% a BACKSWING problem (Video 73)**

1. **Lead Femur Management Failure**
   - Lead knee moves forward in backswing without trail hip counterbalance
   - Creates inevitable thrust pattern
   - Cannot be fixed in downswing (too late)
   - Pattern set by halfway down checkpoint

2. **"Knee Kick In" Fault** (Video 85)
   - Lead knee moves excessively inward at top
   - Breaks three-dot alignment (hip-knee-ankle)
   - 20 yards of distance lost
   - Power generation compromised

3. **Compensatory for Steep Path**
   - Body lifts to prevent club crashing into ground
   - Secondary issue, not primary cause
   - Fix steep path first

**Solutions:**

**"3 Forward, 3 Back" Principle** (Video 73):
- Lead femur moves forward 3 inches
- Trail hip counterbalances back 3 inches
- Turn around pelvis center
- No net forward movement of center

**Lead Knee Position Test** (Video 73):
- **Critical Checkpoint:** Halfway down position
- Lead knee must return to (or behind) starting position
- If forward = early extension inevitable
- Film and verify

**Depth Gauge Training** (Video 73):
- Foam roller or box at toes
- Monitors knee depth boundaries
- Tactile feedback
- Prevents excessive forward movement

**Three-Dot Alignment** (Video 85):
- **At Top:** Hip-knee-ankle relationship
- Knee should NOT kick inward excessively
- Maintain vertical stack
- Enables proper rotation

**Shaft Barrier Drill** (Video 85):
- Prevents knee kick in
- Forces proper backswing pattern
- External control for motor learning
- Progressive removal

---

### Loss of Posture {#loss-of-posture}

**Symptoms:**
- Standing up during swing
- Spine angle changing
- Inconsistent contact
- Loss of power

**Root Causes:**

**IMPORTANT DISTINCTION:** "Losing posture" has two meanings:

1. **Proper Extension** (Video 44) - NOT A FAULT
   - Elite players extend 21° from address to impact
   - Pelvis goes from 16° anterior tilt to 5° posterior tilt
   - This is NORMAL and NECESSARY
   - Visual: "Flat back" from 45° angle
   - Maintain side bend while extending

2. **Early Extension** - FAULT
   - Pelvis moving toward target line
   - See Early Extension section above
   - Compensatory movement

3. **True Loss of Side Bend**
   - Rarely the primary issue
   - Usually compensatory
   - Fix other faults first

**Solutions:**

**Understanding "Losing Posture"** (Video 44):
- **The Myth:** "Maintain posture" throughout swing
- **The Data:** Pros extend significantly (21°)
- **The Reality:** Extension ≠ early extension
- **The Fix:** Stop trying to maintain rigid posture

**45-Degree Flat Back Check**:
- Film from 45° angle
- Have helper verify flat back appearance
- Upper body forms straight line
- This is CORRECT despite 3D extension

**Swing Coach App Head Tracking** (Video 44):
- Real-time feedback
- Monitors head position
- Verifies proper movement pattern
- Technology-assisted training

**If True Early Extension**:
- See Early Extension section
- Fix backswing root cause
- Lead femur management
- "3 forward, 3 back"

---

### Loss of Width {#loss-of-width}

**Symptoms:**
- Hands too close to body
- Collapsed trail arm at top
- Narrow backswing
- Steep downswing compensation required

**Root Causes:**

1. **"Lawnmower Movement"** (Video 6)
   - Overindexing rotation and depth
   - Sacrificing width for turn
   - Collapsing into rotation
   - Most common amateur fault

2. **Trail Arm Collapse**
   - Insufficient shoulder retraction
   - Thinking "connection" means no space
   - Bend without elevation

3. **Connection Misinterpretation** (Video 47)
   - Rigidly keeping arm against ribs
   - Should allow arm to horizontal
   - Connection (adduction) ≠ no elevation

**Solutions:**

**Shoulder Retraction Drill** (Video 6):
- **Measured Movement:** 30-35° retraction
- Trail shoulder blade moves toward spine
- Maintains width while turning
- Not just "turn more"

**Rectangle Maintenance**:
- Keep "box shape" between arms and shoulders
- Two arms form top/bottom
- Two shoulders form sides
- Breaking rectangle = losing width

**Chest-High Backswing Drill** (Video 6):
- Stop at chest height
- Verify width maintained
- Shoulder retraction visible
- Arms haven't collapsed

**Arm to Horizontal** (Video 47):
- Trail upper arm reaches approximately horizontal
- Tricep parallel to ground
- Throwing motion comparison
- Natural athletic position

**Frame Preservation** (Video 51):
- Maintain elbow-shoulder-C7 angle
- Don't collapse frame early
- Delay adding depth
- "Up early, in late"

---

### Sway {#sway}

**Symptoms:**
- Excessive lateral movement in backswing
- Weight too far toward trail side
- Difficult to return to ball
- Inconsistent contact

**Root Causes:**

1. **Lack of Internal Hip Rotation** (Video 27)
   - Not rotating properly at trail hip joint
   - Sliding instead of rotating
   - Loss of rotational power

2. **Pelvis Over-Rotation** (Video 19)
   - Too much lateral movement
   - Exceeds optimal ~1 inch limit
   - Combined with excessive rotation

**Solutions:**

**Turn-in-the-Box Drill** (Video 27):
- **Belt Buckle Cue:** Center → inside of trail ankle
- Expected movement: 0.5-1.5 inches lateral, ~45° rotation
- Internal hip rotation at trail hip joint
- Plumb bob alignment verification

**Split-Stance Drill** (Video 19):
- Lead foot aligned with trail heel
- Restricts excessive movement
- Forces proper rotation pattern
- Focus on internal hip rotation

**Bird's Eye Concept** (Video 31):
- Pelvis rotates around CENTER
- Not around trail hip
- Both hips move symmetrically
- Minimal center point shift

---

### Reverse Pivot {#reverse-pivot}

**Symptoms:**
- Weight on lead side at top of backswing
- Weight on trail side at impact (opposite of desired)
- Very steep shoulder plane
- Weak, inconsistent contact

**Root Causes:**

1. **Excessive Side Tilt**
   - Lead shoulder diving too much
   - Trail shoulder not going up and back
   - Steep spine angle

2. **Lead Hip External Rotation Failure**
   - Not allowing lead hip to rotate properly
   - Restricts backswing pivot
   - Forces upper body tilt compensation

**Solutions:**

**Shoulder Movement Pattern** (Video 20):
- Trail shoulder up and back MORE than lead down and forward
- NOT 1:1 ratio—highly asymmetrical
- Fence feel drill (turn behind imaginary fence)

**Lead Hip External Rotation** (Video 65):
- Belt buckle pulls AWAY from lead femur
- Lead leg straightens
- Creates depth without lateral slide
- Film face-on to verify

**Weight Shift Monitoring**:
- Should feel ~60-70% trail side at top
- NOT 100% on trail side
- Maintains ground contact both sides
- Proper loading for transition

---

### Chicken Wing {#chicken-wing}

**Symptoms:**
- Lead arm collapses/bends excessively after impact
- Elbow pointing outward
- Weak, high ball flight
- Inconsistent contact

**Root Causes:**

1. **Trying to "Hold Posture"**
   - Resisting natural extension
   - Fighting biomechanical necessity
   - Lead arm forced to fold awkwardly

2. **Path Too Inside-Out**
   - Swing path excessively from inside
   - Lead arm must bend to avoid body
   - Compensation for other faults

3. **Lack of Proper Release**
   - Not allowing natural club swivel
   - Trying to "hold angles"
   - Lead arm folds improperly

**Solutions:**

**Understanding Proper Extension** (Video 44):
- Body MUST extend through impact
- 21° of extension is NORMAL
- Trying to prevent this creates chicken wing
- Allow natural movement

**Scott Hamilton Drill** (Video 77):
- Lead-hand-only half swings
- Teaches proper lead arm fold
- Natural weight-driven release
- "Left exit" through club swivel
- Lead arm folds post-impact (mirror of trail arm in backswing)

**Path Correction**:
- If too inside-out, neutral path allows straight lead arm longer
- Film down-the-line
- Verify proper path
- Eliminate need for compensation

---

## Power & Distance Issues

### Lack of Distance {#lack-of-distance}

**Symptoms:**
- Below expected distance for skill level
- Good contact but limited yardage
- Fatigue from effort without results

**Root Causes:**

1. **Poor Kinematic Sequencing**
   - Not generating ground-up power
   - Arms dominant instead of body-driven
   - Loss of sequential acceleration

2. **Timing Issues** (Video 2)
   - Not creating speed early in backswing
   - "Bunny slope" speed graph vs "steep hill"
   - When > what/how much

3. **Trail Leg Issues** (Videos 34, 48, 85)
   - Incorrect knee flex pattern
   - Trail leg collapse preventing rotation
   - Pelvis rotation limited (20-30° vs 45° optimal)

4. **Loss of Width** (Video 6)
   - Narrow backswing
   - Loss of arc size
   - Reduced clubhead travel distance

5. **Weight Shift Problems** (Video 55)
   - Excessive slide replacing rotation
   - Femur position issues
   - "Stuck" position

**Solutions:**

**Early Loading for Speed** (Video 2):
- Add 7 mph early in backswing = 7 mph more at impact
- Pre-shot speed priming routine
- Four detailed drills
- Rory McIlroy timing pattern

**Trail Leg Training** (Videos 34, 48, 85):
- **Knee Flex Pattern:** Gain +6° flex in backswing (don't straighten)
- **Trail Leg Extension Drills:** Vertical + rotational movement
- **Space Invader:** Knee moves forward through impact
- **20-Yard Gain Example:** Fix knee kick in fault

**Width Maintenance** (Video 6):
- Shoulder retraction (30-35°)
- Rectangle maintenance
- Chest-high checkpoint
- Prevent lawnmower collapse

**Internal/External Hip Rotation** (Video 65):
- Differential rotation pattern
- Backswing: Lead hip external, trail hip internal
- Downswing: Trail hip external, lead hip internal
- Creates elastic stretch and automatic power

**Halfpipe Pivot** (Video 62):
- Angled pivot (not level spinning)
- Lead hip "to wall and stay there"
- Trail leg diagnostic (shin/femur toward target at top)
- X-factor optimization

---

### Inconsistent Speed {#inconsistent-speed}

**Symptoms:**
- Variable clubhead speed
- Unpredictable distances
- Some swings fast, some slow

**Root Causes:**

1. **Setup Drift** (Video 99)
   - Imperceptible setup changes
   - Accumulate over time
   - Affect entire kinematic sequence

2. **Tempo Variations**
   - Inconsistent backswing speed
   - Variable transition timing
   - React to last ball syndrome

3. **Sequencing Breakdown**
   - Arms taking over some swings
   - Body-driven others
   - No consistent pattern

**Solutions:**

**Progressive Speed Integration** (Video 99):
- 25% → 50% → 75% → game speed
- Feel recalibration at each level
- Build consistent pattern
- Parameter focus (not ball flight)

**Setup Monitoring**:
- Constant verification essential
- Video documentation
- Return to baseline regularly
- Prevent imperceptible drift

**Body's Trackman**:
- Daily biomechanical calibration
- As important as ball flight
- Parameter-focused practice
- 1-2 specific movements per session

### Loss of Lag {#loss-of-lag}

**Symptoms:**
- Wrist angle releasing too early
- Loss of compression
- Reduced distance
- Inefficient power transfer

**Root Causes:**

**SEE CASTING SECTION** - Loss of lag = casting

Primary causes:
1. Trail arm lowering instead of lifting in backswing (Video 80)
2. Grip issues (Video 53)
3. Trail arm not reconnecting (Video 61)
4. Wrist/grip security (Video 56)

**The "Hold Lag" Myth** (Video 32):
- Biomechanically impossible to "hold" through impact
- Must release to make ground contact
- Question is WHEN and WHERE, not whether

**Solutions:**

See Casting Solutions above, plus:

**Understanding Lag Reality**:
- All golfers (including pros) release lag
- Difference is timing and location
- Poor players release "up here" (early downswing)
- Elite players release late but still release

**Focus on Backswing**:
- Fix arm lift pattern
- Proper width maintenance
- Correct sequencing
- Lag becomes byproduct

## Tempo & Timing

### Rushed Transition {#rushed-transition}

**Symptoms:**
- Fast, jerky change of direction at top
- Loss of rhythm
- Inconsistent contact
- Feel of being "quick" or "snatchy"

**Root Causes:**

1. **Slow Backswing Compensation** (Videos 3, 4)
   - Too deliberate/slow in backswing
   - Forces hurry-up to complete
   - Overthinking takeaway then rushing

2. **Not Understanding "The Float"** (Video 5)
   - Thinking pause means stop everything
   - Club should pause while body starts
   - Kinematic sequence requires this

**Solutions:**

**"More Motion" in Backswing** (Videos 3, 7):
- Generate "little more motion" early
- Proper momentum naturally dissipates into quiet transition
- Race car analogy: Correct speed into corner = smooth exit

**Two-Count Pause Drill** (Video 4):
- Pause at top
- Will feel like "half an hour"
- Recalibrates tempo awareness
- Prevents rushed transition

**The Float Understanding** (Video 5):
- Pause in CLUBHEAD, not body
- Lower body starts while club finishes
- Cannot slam into reverse at 50 mph
- Kinematic sequence requires overlap

**Pendulum Rhythm Drill** (Video 7):
- Continuous motion pattern
- Trail foot heel lift timing
- Natural swing flow
- No segmented positions

### Slow Backswing Problems {#slow-backswing}

**Symptoms:**
- Overly deliberate takeaway
- Inconsistent transition
- Loss of rhythm
- Bouncing at top

**Root Causes:**

1. **Too Much Control**
   - Thinking about too many positions
   - Consciously controlling every inch
   - Prevents natural motion

2. **Misunderstanding Tempo**
   - Think slower is better
   - Actually creates issues
   - Momentum management problem

**Solutions:**

**Speed Up Backswing** (Video 10):
- Counter-intuitive: MORE speed in backswing
- Proper momentum creates stable transition
- Natural dissipation into quiet top
- Prevents bouncing

**Quick-Slow-Quick Pattern** (Video 83):
- Fast takeaway
- Slow at top
- Fast through impact
- Reverse of common error pattern

**Continuous Motion** (Video 7):
- No pause at takeaway
- Flowing movement
- Natural momentum
- Athletic pattern

---

### Poor Tempo {#poor-tempo}

**Symptoms:**
- Rushed, slow, or inconsistent rhythm
- Variable results
- Difficulty finding consistent feel

**Root Causes:**

1. **No Consistent Pattern**
   - Different tempo each swing
   - Reacting to last ball
   - No baseline to return to

2. **Thinking During Swing**
   - Too many conscious thoughts
   - Interrupted flow
   - Mechanical vs athletic

**Solutions:**

**Short Game Tempo Training** (Video 94):
- Match backswing and downswing speeds
- Equal tempo throughout motion
- Avoid slow/short → fast compensation
- Avoid fast/long → deceleration

**Quick-Slow-Quick Drill** (Video 83):
- 1-2 practice swings with pattern
- Then replicate over ball
- Establishes consistent baseline

**Progressive Speed Integration** (Video 99):
- 25% → 50% → 75% → game speed
- Maintain consistent pattern at each speed
- Feel recalibration
- Build automatic rhythm

## Diagnostic Flowchart

### If Ball Flight is Your Issue:

1. **Slice** → Check grip (Videos 53, 90), width (Video 6), release (Video 58)
2. **Hook** → Check pelvis rotation (Video 19), path, release timing
3. **Pull** → Check arm lowering (Video 33), takeaway (Video 37), sequencing
4. **Push/Block** → Check shaft lean (Video 75), pelvis rotation (Video 19), release

### If Contact is Your Issue:

1. **Topping** → Check weight transfer (Video 12), attack angle (Video 67)
2. **Fat/Thin** → Check scooping (Video 92), weight transfer, setup drift (Video 99)
3. **Toe/Heel** → Check foot spray feedback (Video 87), posture, early extension (Video 73)

### If Swing Pattern is Your Issue:

1. **Casting** → **CHECK BACKSWING FIRST** (Video 80), grip (Video 53), trail arm (Video 61)
2. **Steep** → Check bow wrist myth (Video 37), timing (Video 51), setup (Video 59)
3. **Early Extension** → **99.99% BACKSWING** (Video 73), lead femur, knee position

### If Distance is Your Issue:

1. **Check Sequencing** → Early loading (Video 2), kinematic pattern
2. **Check Trail Leg** → Knee flex (Video 34), rotation (Video 48), position (Video 85)
3. **Check Width** → Shoulder retraction (Video 6), rectangle maintenance
4. **Check Hip Pattern** → Internal/external rotation (Video 65), halfpipe (Video 62)

## Key Diagnostic Principles

### 1. Most Faults Originate in Backswing or Setup
- Casting: Backswing arm pattern (Video 80)
- Steep Downswing: Backswing timing (Video 51) or setup (Video 59)
- Early Extension: 99.99% backswing problem (Video 73)
- Poor Tempo: Backswing speed issues (Videos 3, 4)

### 2. Fix Root Cause, Not Symptom
- Early extension = symptom; lead femur management = cause
- Loss of lag = symptom; trail arm lift = cause
- Steep downswing often = symptom of laid-off (which is caused by takeaway)

### 3. What You Feel ≠ What You Do
- Video verification essential
- Exaggerated feels often necessary
- Technology provides objective truth
- 2D video creates illusions (use 3D concepts)

### 4. Setup Drift is Real
- Imperceptible changes accumulate (Video 99)
- Sabotages swing changes
- Constant monitoring required
- Return to baseline regularly

### 5. One-Two Focus Areas Maximum
- Don't work on everything
- Parameter-focused practice
- Allow motor learning time
- Progressive integration
