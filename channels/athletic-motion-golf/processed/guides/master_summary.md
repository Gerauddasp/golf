## Introduction to AMG's Approach {#introduction}

### Core Philosophy

Athletic Motion Golf represents a paradigm shift in golf instruction, moving from feel-based teaching to **evidence-based biomechanics**. Using technologies like GEARS 3D motion capture, Trackman launch monitors, and force plates, AMG has analyzed millions of swings to identify what elite players actually do—often contradicting decades of traditional instruction.

### Key Differentiators

1. **Data Over Feels**: What you feel ≠ what you do. AMG emphasizes video verification and measurement.
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Fixing symptoms vs. addressing underlying biomechanical issues.
3. **Individual Variation**: Respecting physical differences while identifying universal patterns.
4. **3D Understanding**: Golf swing occurs in 3D space; 2D video creates illusions.
5. **Tour Player Benchmarks**: All instruction backed by analysis of elite players.

### Technology Arsenal

- **GEARS 3D Motion Capture**: Tracks 1000+ data points per swing
- **Trackman**: Ball flight and club delivery data
- **Force Plates**: Ground reaction forces and weight transfer
- **AMG Swing Coach App**: Real-time feedback for practice
- **High-Speed Video**: Multi-angle swing analysis

## Biomechanics Fundamentals {#biomechanics-fundamentals}

### 1. Spine Angle & Pivot

**Virtual Spine Angle (Video 13)**
- **Optimal Position**: 90° neutral spine at top of backswing
- **Measurement**: 3D virtual line through pelvis and rib cage
- **Common Error**: Excessive side tilt (steep spine angle) or reverse spine
- **Key Insight**: What looks like "vertical spine" on 2D video is actually 74-80° in 3D
- **Tennis Ball Pivot Concept**: Imagine rotating around tennis ball at spine base
- **Benefits**: Optimal rotation, back safety, consistency

**Posture Changes During Swing (Video 44)**
- **The Myth**: "Maintain your posture" throughout the swing
- **The Reality**: Elite players extend 21° from address to impact
- **Data**: Pelvis goes from 16° anterior tilt to 5° posterior tilt
- **Key Distinction**: This is proper extension, NOT early extension/thrust
- **Visual Checkpoint**: "Flat back" appearance from 45° camera angle
- **Critical**: Must maintain side bend while extending (3D movement)

### 2. Pelvic Motion & Hip Rotation

**Hip Depth & Rotation (Video 26)**
- **Two Critical Movements**:
  1. Hip depth during rotation (not flat spinning)
  2. Pelvic tilt (anterior-posterior) while rotating
- **Universal Pattern**: Present in ALL elite players
- **TPI Assessment**: Pelvic tilt isolation test reveals restrictions
- **Common Issue**: Shaking during isolation = underdeveloped motor patterns

**Center-Axis Rotation (Video 31)**
- **Misconception**: Rotating around trail hip
- **Reality**: Pelvis rotates around its CENTER in both directions
- **Bird's Eye View**: Right hip moves TOWARD ball in downswing
- **Result**: Proper weight transfer and power generation

**Internal/External Hip Rotation (Video 65)**
- **The Discovery**: Elite players create differential rotation between pelvis and legs
- **Backswing Pattern**:
  - Lead hip: External rotation (pelvis turns AWAY from lead knee)
  - Trail hip: Internal rotation
- **Downswing Pattern**:
  - Trail hip: External rotation (pelvis turns AWAY from trail knee)
  - Lead hip: Internal rotation
- **Creates**: Elastic "stretch" that powers automatic transition
- **Visual Checkpoint**: Lead leg straight in backswing, trail leg straight at impact

### 3. Shoulder & Ribcage Mechanics

**Shoulder Plane & Movement (Video 20)**
- **Key Principle**: Trail shoulder must move up and back MORE than lead shoulder moves down and forward
- **Not 1:1 Ratio**: Far more asymmetrical than golfers realize
- **Diagnostic**: Film down-the-line, draw vertical line from lead shoulder at address
- **Checkpoint**: At top, significantly more body mass behind line than in front
- **"Fence Feel" Drill**: Imagine turning behind fence 6 inches in front of chest

**Head Movement Reality (Video 23)**
- **The Myth**: "Keep your head still"
- **The Reality**: Head MUST move to appear stable (like camera gimbal)
- **Biomechanics**: Shoulders rotate MORE ACROSS than DOWN due to spine tilt
- **Two Common Errors**:
  1. Happy Gilmore lifting
  2. Excessive left tilt (reverse pivot)
- **Solution**: Fix pivot first, head follows naturally

### 4. Weight Shift & Ground Forces

**Proper Weight Transfer (Video 55)**
- **Common Error**: Replacing backswing slide with excessive downswing slide
- **Joint Stacking**: Hip-knee-ankle A-frame relationship
- **Backswing Limit**: ~1 inch lateral movement maximum
- **Downswing Limit**: Knee at or just inside ankle
- **Key Insight**: Trail femur position is #1 cause of "stuck" swings
- **Wall Drill**: Tactile feedback for proper limits

---

## Backswing Mechanics {#backswing-mechanics}

### 1. Takeaway

**The Two-Dial System (Video 9)**
- **T Dial (Turn)**: Body rotation = horizontal movement
- **L Dial (Lift)**: Arm elevation = vertical movement
- **Critical**: Both dials must turn at EQUAL rates
- **Target**: 45-degree swing plane
- **Common Error**: Perfect position rehearsal without body turn, then add full pivot in real swing
- **Result**: Everything gets sucked inside (too much turn, not enough lift)

**Body-Driven Takeaway (Video 40)**
- **Principle**: Lead shoulder rotation drives takeaway (not isolated club manipulation)
- **Key Checkpoint**: Hands and club head move along same track
- **Common Fault**: "Scissoring" where hand path diverges from club path
- **Success Metric**: Uniform lowering rates through impact

**Inside Takeaway Fix (Video 69)**
- **Technology**: Hack Motion wrist angle tracking
- **Main Drill**: "Cast feel" technique with progressive speed
- **Scientific Concept**: Wrist angle dynamics and spatial awareness
- **Performance Impact**: Improvements across entire bag from proper takeaway

### 2. Trail Arm in Backswing

**Trail Arm Elevation (Video 11)**
- **Critical Concept**: Trail arm should move UPWARD (not backward/behind)
- **Pattern**: Arms go up AS body turns
- **Feel**: Arms should feel "more in front" throughout backswing
- **Asymmetric Movement**: Trail arm lowers MORE in downswing than it lifts in backswing

**Connection vs. Elevation (Video 39)**
- **The Dangerous Misinterpretation**: Lowering trail arm during backswing
- **Key Distinction**: Connection (adduction) and elevation are DIFFERENT movements
- **Reality**: You can have both simultaneously
- **Jake Knapp's Drill**: Glove under arm demonstrates maintaining connection while allowing elevation

**Backswing Trail Arm Lift (Video 80)**
- **Casting's True Origin**: In the BACKSWING, not downswing
- **Segment-to-Segment Analysis**: Trail arm must LIFT relative to torso
- **Elite Pattern**: Increase 40-45° arm-torso angle from address
- **Counter-Intuitive**: Arms can lower relative to torso even while club/hands appear to rise
- **Split-Hands Drill**: Forces proper arm lift (makes lowering impossible)
- **Head Circle Checkpoint**: Hands stay outside imaginary circle around head at top

### 3. Width & Depth

**The #1 Width Mistake (Video 6)**
- **Core Concept**: Distance between hands and body = "most important real estate in swing"
- **Main Problem**: Overindexing rotation and depth at expense of width
- **The "Lawnmower Movement"**: Collapsing into turn
- **Solution**: Trail shoulder retraction (30-35° measured) combined with arm lift
- **Key Drill**: Shoulder-width arms-straight drill (foolproof mechanics)
- **Rectangle Maintenance**: Keep box shape between arms and shoulders

**Depth Without Losing Posture (Video 91)**
- **Data**: Analysis of 1,112,949 swings
- **#1 Fault**: Hands too deep at top BUT achieved by losing spine angle
- **Critical Insight**: HOW you create depth matters more than how much
- **Proper Method**: Depth at expense of posture causes steepening, not shallowing
- **Individual Variation**: YOUR optimal depth determined by mobility
- **Club-on-Shoulder Drill**: Find personal depth limit while maintaining posture

**Up Early, In Late (Video 51)**
- **Mistiming Problem**: Adding depth too early in backswing creates steep downswing
- **Elite Pattern**: Delay moving arms across until after lead arm reaches parallel
- **Checkpoint**: Down-the-line view at lead arm parallel
- **Rory McIlroy Example**: Maintains elbow-shoulder-C7 angle throughout backswing
- **Automatic Shallowing**: Proper backswing loading creates shallowing without manipulation

### 4. Wrist Positions & Grip

**Grip Fundamentals (Video 57, 90)**
- **Paradox**: Maintain firm grip pressure while retaining wrist/forearm mobility
- **Common Error**: Gripping at address position causes palm-heavy placement
- **Solution**: Grip with altered arm rotation for finger-base placement
- **Two Tour Methods**:
  1. Behind-the-Back Method
  2. In-Front Method
- **Benefits**: Freer wrist hinge, better release, more speed

**Grip-Related Casting (Video 53)**
- **Three Primary Causes**:
  1. Lead hand heel pad misplacement (creates wobble)
  2. Trail thumb "glide-off" (most common - "air in grip")
  3. Trail thumb on top (excessive leverage, promotes early release)

### 5. Tempo & Timing

**Tempo Mistakes (Videos 1, 3, 4, 5)**
- **Pattern #1**: Slow takeaway + fast second half = rushed transition
- **Pattern #2**: Overthinking takeaway + hurrying to complete = tempo dysfunction
- **Solution**: Generate "more motion" in early backswing
- **Race Car Analogy**: Too slow into corner causes unpredictable exits
- **Tour Player Pattern**: Smooth acceleration throughout entire backswing

**The Pause Misconception (Video 5)**
- **Key Insight**: "Pause" happens in CLUBHEAD, not body
- **Driving Analogy**: Can't slam car into reverse at 50 mph
- **Proper Sequencing**: Lower body starts downswing while club completes backswing
- **Error**: Stopping everything at top ruins kinematic sequence

**Speed in Backswing (Video 2)**
- **Revolutionary Finding**: Adding 7 mph early in backswing = 7 mph more at impact
- **Speed Graph**: Amateur "bunny slope" vs tour "steep hill"
- **Rory Comparison**: Student matched Rory's timing pattern
- **Key Quote**: "When you do something is more important than what or how much"
- **4 Detailed Drills**: Including "Pre-Shot Speed Priming" routine

## Transition & Downswing {#transition-downswing}

### 1. The Transition

**The "Float" (Video 56)**
- **Critical Moment**: Club finishes backswing while body starts downswing
- **Three Keys**:
  1. Air-tight grip security
  2. Delayed wrist set (natural 90° hinge at top)
  3. The float (club lags behind body rotation)

**Trail Knee in Transition (Video 34)**
- **The Myth**: "Straighten your trail knee" in backswing
- **GEARS Data**: Tour players BEND trail knee during backswing (avg +6° flex)
- **The "Knee Switch"**: Lead leg bent in backswing, trail leg bent in downswing
- **Wave Pattern**: Trail knee follows flexion pattern, not static positioning
- **Lead Arm Parallel Drill**: Emphasizes trail knee gaining flex through transition

### 2. Arm & Club Lowering

**Trail Arm Lowering (Video 30, 35, 82)**
- **Universal Pattern**: ALL elite players lower trail arm to outside of trail hip
- **Shirt Seam Angle**: Lower along this natural angle (not vertically)
- **NEVER Seen**: "Leading with elbow" doesn't exist in $1.7B+ career earnings analysis
- **Simplicity**: Described as "simplest and physically easiest move in golf"
- **Trail Arm Reconnection (Video 61)**: Two movements required:
  1. Reconnect to torso during transition
  2. Extend through impact

**Elbow Position Reality (Videos 81, 84, 86)**
- **Bird's Eye Overhead Analysis**: Trail elbow moves DEEPER and farther BEHIND pelvis
- **Pelvis Box Reference**: Elbow never moves in front of pelvis
- **35 Milliseconds Pre-Impact**: Elbow actually moves FARTHER OUTSIDE through impact
- **Myth Debunked**: "Get elbow in front of hip" contradicts elite biomechanics
- **Visual Illusion**: Traditional camera angles mislead; overhead perspective corrects

### 3. Lower Body Sequencing

**Trail Leg Movement (Video 48, 85)**
- **Common Problem**: Trail leg collapse preventing proper hip rotation
- **GEARS Data**: Pelvis only 20-30° open vs tour average 40-45°
- **Solution**: Trail leg straightening during downswing (vertical + rotational)
- **Not Forward Collapse**: Specific movement pattern required
- **20-Yard Gain Example**: 57-year-old gained 20 yards fixing "knee kick in" fault

**Trail Knee Pattern (Video 49)**
- **Space Invader Concept**: Trail knee moves FORWARD through impact
- **Every Joint Has Swing Plane**: Knee travels forward-and-around toward ball
- **Heel Release**: Must come off ground to enable proper motion
- **Pelvis Rotation Result**: 45° open at impact

**Lead Leg Bracing (Video 85)**
- **Three-Dot Alignment**: Hip-knee-ankle vertical stack
- **Stance Width**: Outside hip width minimum
- **Transition Checkpoint**: Knee over ankle, hip behind
- **Uppercut Release**: Final speed component

### 4. Hip & Pelvis Motion

**The Halfpipe Concept (Video 62)**
- **Misconception**: "Turn" as level plane rotation
- **Reality**: Angled pivot (halfpipe vs spinning top)
- **Lead Hip Principle**: "To the wall and stay there" (bracing)
- **X-Factor Optimization**: 20° to proper separation
- **Shopping Cart Analogy**: Acceleration → bracing → transfer
- **Trail Leg Diagnostic**: Film at top - shin/femur should angle toward target

**Early Extension Root Cause (Video 73)**
- **Misleading Term**: Real issue is "early thrust" (pelvis toward target line)
- **99.99% Backswing Problem**: Not fixable in downswing
- **GEARS Proof**: Improper lead femur management in backswing makes thrust inevitable
- **"3 Forward, 3 Back" Principle**: Lead femur forward, trail hip counterbalances back
- **Lead Knee Position Test**: Must return to starting position by halfway down

**Pelvis Over-Rotation (Video 19)**
- **Common Fault**: Excessive pelvis rotation during backswing
- **Biomechanical Chain**: Over-rotation → forward bend → backward tilt at impact → blocks/hooks
- **Split-Stance Drill**: Lead foot aligned with trail heel for correction
- **Focus**: Internal hip rotation and weight retention

### 5. Upper Body Management

**Shoulder-Hip Relationship (Video 54)**
- **#1 Fix**: Shoulders remain ~40-45° closed relative to hips PASSIVELY
- **Critical Error**: Actively keeping shoulders closed while yanking arms
- **Proper Method**: Let pelvis carry arms through sequencing
- **Lazy Susan Principle (Video 63)**: Pelvis rotation naturally brings upper body around
- **Warning**: Going against generational elite patterns is "really dicey"

**Rotation Prerequisites (Video 16)**
- **Three Must-Haves Before Adding Rotation**:
  1. Slack in Transition: Rotational capacity remaining at top
  2. Proper Club Face Position: Face on top of shaft at top
  3. Arms Working Down: Not "leaving them up" while rotating
- **Bracketing Practice**: Intentionally steep → intentionally shallow → find middle
- **Data-Driven**: Swing Coach app protocol for monitoring hand path

## Impact & Release {#impact-release}

### 1. Impact Position

**The "Create Space" Myth (Videos 88, 96)**
- **Biggest Myth in Golf**: Need to create space by wiping hands across body
- **Reality**: Hands stay on trail side through impact
- **Visual Illusion**: Created by hip rotation while camera stays stationary
- **GEARS Data**: Trail elbow moves ~8 inches OUT and AROUND toward ball
- **Handle Position**: 2-3 inches HIGHER and 4-5 inches FORWARD at impact
- **All Tour Players**: Operate within tight biomechanical window

**Standing Up Through Impact (Videos 14, 15)**
- **"Staying Down" Myth**: Terrible description, opposite of reality
- **Elite Pattern**: Move UP with pelvis starting around lead arm parallel
- **The Difference**: Add SIDE TILT simultaneously while rising
- **3D Motion**: What you see on 2D is deceiving
- **Diagnostic**: Standing up is compensatory, not primary fault
  - Cause 1: Overly steep club path
  - Cause 2: Weight too far back
  - Cause 3: Club too far underneath

**Practice Position (Video 17)**
- **Critical Checkpoint**: Transition position (waist-high to impact)
- **Elite Pattern**: Rehearse this position for kinesthetic awareness
- **Key Metric**: Trail knee LOWER than lead knee through impact
- **Natural Cascade**: Trail knee lower → hip tilt → upper body tilt automatic
- **Common Fault**: Bending trail knee while letting trail hip RISE

### 2. Release Mechanics

**Wrist & Forearm Release (Video 58)**
- **Misconception**: Body rotation squares clubface
- **Reality**: Minimal body rotation from shaft parallel to impact
- **Clubface Rotation Required**: 45-65 degrees in milliseconds
- **Three Essential Wrist Movements**:
  1. Ulnar deviation (uncocking)
  2. Supination
  3. Extension
- **Common Deficiency**: Most amateurs under-perform ulnar deviation
- **Paradox**: Golfers obsessing over shaft lean typically lack it

**The Scott Hamilton Drill (Video 77)**
- **Primary Drill**: Lead-hand-only half swings
- **3D Validation**: Matches what elite players actually do
- **Cannot Be Overdone**: Practice for hours safely
- **Natural Weight-Driven Release**: Club swivel creates "left exit"
- **Key**: Lead arm folds post-impact (symmetry with trail arm in backswing)
- **Shaft Lean Reality**: Appears WITH release, not instead of it

**Lag & Release Reality (Video 32)**
- **The Myth**: "Hold lag" through impact
- **Biomechanical Impossibility**: Holding angle = missing ground by 2 feet
- **Must Release**: Question is WHEN and WHERE, not whether
- **Elite Difference**: Poor players release too early in downswing

### 3. Shaft Lean

**Shaft Lean vs Release (Video 46, 58)**
- **Harmful Drill**: Shaft extension drill (prevents stick hitting side)
- **Problem**: Teaches pulling arms across body for shaft lean
- **Reality**: Shaft lean is BYPRODUCT, not conscious creation
- **AMG Never Discusses**: Shaft lean appears naturally from proper mechanics
- **Driver vs Irons (Video 75)**:
  - Irons: ~8° forward shaft lean
  - Driver: 0-2° max (essentially vertical)
- **Modern Instruction Issue**: Forward lean emphasis improves irons but disasters with driver

### 4. Divot Contact

**Proper Divot Taking (Video 28)**
- **Location**: In FRONT of ball (not behind or absent)
- **Counter-Intuitive Truth**: "Holding lag" PREVENTS proper divot
- **Biomechanics**: Maintaining wrist angle shortens effective club length
- **Release Necessity**: Must release for club to reach turf after ball
- **Physical Proof**: Forward divot = correct ball-first sequence

## Common Faults & Fixes {#common-faults}

### 1. Casting

**Root Causes**
- **Backswing Origin (Video 80)**: Arms lowering instead of lifting relative to torso
- **Grip Issues (Video 53)**: Three primary grip faults promote casting
- **Trail Arm Mistakes (Video 61)**: Failing to reconnect trail arm during transition
- **Wrist Problems (Video 56)**: Grip security and delayed wrist set issues

**Solutions**
- **Split-Hands Drill**: Forces proper arm lift in backswing
- **Head Circle Checkpoint**: Hands stay outside circle around head
- **Grip Correction Drills**: Address three specific grip faults
- **Trail Arm Reconnection**: Two-part movement (reconnect then extend)
- **The Float Practice**: Club finishes while body starts downswing

### 2. Steep Downswing

**Root Causes**
- **Common "Fix" Makes It Worse (Video 37)**: Bowing lead wrist at top creates laid-off position
- **Backswing Mistiming (Video 51)**: Adding depth too early in backswing
- **Sam Burns Example (Video 59)**: Setup flaw (open body, elevated trail forearm)
- **Rotation Without Prerequisites (Video 16)**: Missing three critical elements

**Solutions**
- **Forearm Rotation Awareness**: Natural wrist angles, not manipulation
- **"Up Early, In Late" Pattern**: Delay arm movement across
- **Setup Correction**: Square hips/shoulders, level forearms
- **Club-on-Shoulder Punch Drill**: Trains proper plane

### 3. Topped Shots

**Root Causes**
- **Weight Stuck Back (Video 12)**: Weight on trail foot at impact
- **Fairway Woods (Video 67)**: Incorrect angle of attack
- **Helping It Up (Video 67)**: Scooping motion

**Solutions**
- **Forward Hip Shift Drill**: Transfer weight from trail to lead foot
- **Tee Clipping Drill**: Sweep tee cleanly off turf for zero attack angle
- **Mental Cue**: "Sweep it—pretend the tee's still there"

### 4. Loss of Width

**Root Causes**
- **Lawnmower Move (Video 6)**: Overindexing rotation at expense of width
- **Trail Arm Collapse**: Insufficient shoulder retraction
- **Connection Misinterpretation (Video 47)**: Rigidly pressing arm against ribs

**Solutions**
- **Shoulder Retraction Drill**: 30-35° measured movement
- **Rectangle Maintenance**: Keep box shape between arms/shoulders
- **Arm to Horizontal**: Allow natural lift to tricep parallel position

### 5. Early Extension

**Root Causes**
- **Backswing Problem (Video 73)**: 99.99% originates in backswing, not downswing
- **Lead Femur Management**: Moving forward without trail hip counterbalance
- **Knee Kick In (Video 85)**: Lead knee moving excessively inward at top

**Solutions**
- **"3 Forward, 3 Back" Principle**: Balanced pelvis center rotation
- **Lead Knee Position Test**: Return to start by halfway down
- **Depth Gauge Training**: Foam roller/box at toes for boundaries
- **Three-Dot Alignment**: Hip-knee-ankle vertical stack

### 6. Pull Shots

**Root Causes**
- **Missing Arm Lowering (Video 33)**: Not lowering along shirt seam angle
- **Club Tipping Out**: Laid-off position causes pull compensation

**Solutions**
- **Shirt Seam Arm Lowering Drill**: Lower toward rib cage along natural angle
- **Static Awareness Drill**: Pattern building without ball
- **Coordinate with Body Rotation**: Integrate arm lowering with pivot

### 7. Inconsistent Contact

**Root Causes**
- **Off-Center Hits**: Not finding sweet spot
- **Swing Path Issues**: Club not tracking properly
- **Setup Drift**: Imperceptible changes accumulate

**Solutions**
- **Foot Spray on Clubface (Video 87)**: Visual feedback on contact location
- **Double Club Drill (Video 64)**: Identifies problematic arm
- **Setup Monitoring**: Constant verification of fundamentals

---

## Speed & Power Training {#speed-power}

### 1. Timing-Based Speed

**Early Loading Concept (Video 2)**
- **Discovery**: Adding speed EARLY in backswing = speed at impact
- **Data**: 7 mph early gain = 7 mph at impact (87 → 94 mph)
- **Speed Graph**: Tour players show "steep hill" vs amateur "bunny slope"
- **Stretch-Shortening Cycle**: Early loading creates elastic energy
- **Pre-Shot Speed Priming**: 4-drill progression for implementation

**Backswing Speed (Video 10)**
- **Counter-Intuitive**: Speed UP backswing for effortless power
- **Proper Momentum**: Naturally dissipates into quiet transition
- **Race Car Analogy**: Correct speed into corner = smooth exit

### 2. Lower Body Power

**Trail Leg Action (Video 62)**
- **Angled Pivot**: Halfpipe concept vs level spinning top
- **Lead Hip Bracing**: "To wall and stay there"
- **Trail Leg Internal Rotation**: Backswing diagnostic (shin/femur toward target)
- **Lead Side Stacking**: Knee over ankle, hip over knee at impact

**Hip Rotation for Speed (Video 65)**
- **Differential Rotation**: Pelvis vs legs through hip joints
- **Elastic Stretch**: Creates automatic transition power
- **Backswing**: Lead hip external, trail hip internal rotation
- **Downswing**: Trail hip external, lead hip internal rotation

**Ground Forces (Video 85)**
- **20-Yard Gain**: Real example from fixing one leg move
- **Force Generation**: Proper bracing and sequencing
- **Lead Leg Stack**: Critical for power transfer

### 3. Sequencing

**Kinematic Sequence (Videos throughout)**
- **Order**: Ground → pelvis → torso → arms → club
- **Lower Body Leads**: Pelvis starts before shoulders
- **Shoulder-Hip Differential**: 40-45° separation maintained
- **Trail Knee Timing**: Gains flex through transition
- **Arm Lowering**: Coordinates with body rotation

---

## Club-Specific Instruction {#club-specific}

### 1. Driver

**Setup & Positions**
- **Shaft Lean (Video 75)**: 0-2° maximum (essentially vertical at impact)
- **Ball Position**: Forward in stance
- **Spine Tilt**: More than irons to enable upward strike
- **Handle Depth Problem (Video 72)**: Too deep creates geometry issues

**Swing Thoughts**
- **"18-Wheeler" Feel**: Deliver club earlier with "tickling grass" sensation
- **Give It Time (Video 74)**: Longer club needs more time than wedges
- **Don't Rush Transition**: Let backswing complete fully

**Common Issues**
- **Pull-Twist Pattern (Video 79)**: Excessive handle pulling + late twist
- **Forward Ball Position Effect**: Requires different mechanics than irons
- **Blocks/Low Hooks**: Result of too much forward shaft lean

### 2. Fairway Woods

**Contact Fundamentals**
- **Attack Angle (Video 71)**: Zero (neutral) - PGA Tour data shows 0-2° down
- **Contact Feel**: "Barely tickle the grass" with sole
- **Impact Location**: Just above bottom groove on face
- **Not Descending Blow**: Perfectly neutral arc bottom

**Common Errors & Fixes**
- **Topping (Video 67)**: Incorrect angle of attack
  - **Tee Clipping Drill**: Place tee flat, sweep cleanly off turf
  - **Mental Cue**: "Sweep it—pretend tee's still there"
- **Inconsistency (Video 76)**: Same tee drill on practice mat
- **Rushing (Video 74)**: Give larger circle more time
  - **Pause at Top**: Beneficial for most golfers
  - **Geometric Principle**: Larger circles need more time

**Setup Keys**
- **Simple Tip (Video 74)**: Long, slow tempo
- **PGA Tour Secret (Video 71)**: Brush sole through impact zone

### 3. Irons

**Impact Requirements**
- **Shaft Lean**: ~8° forward lean optimal
- **Ball-First Contact**: Divot in FRONT of ball
- **Shoulder Position (Video 41)**: 2-2.5" forward of setup
- **Lead Shoulder at Impact**: Differs from driver (at/behind setup)

**Common Faults**
- **Scooping (Video 92)**:
  - **Impact Bag Drill**: Trail hip rotation delivery
  - **Grip Twist**: Face control through impact
- **Fat Shots (Video 92)**: Same drills as scooping
- **Thin/Topped**: Weight transfer issues

**Compression Keys**
- **Angle of Attack**: Descending blow for compression
- **Body Position**: Upper body ahead at impact
- **Divot Pattern**: Forward and consistent depth

### 4. Wedges & Short Game

**Full Swing Wedges**
- **Connection Drill Caveat (Video 42)**: Works for partial wedges
- **Problem**: Harmful when applied to full swings
- **Restricts**: Necessary trail arm elevation

**Chipping**

**Chip vs Pitch Distinction (Video 93)**
- **Chip (Number One)**:
  - Setup: Hands high, face square/slightly shut
  - Backswing: Straight back low
  - Feel: "Putting with loft"
  - Result: Low trajectory, maximum roll
- **Pitch (Number Two)**:
  - Setup: Hands lower, face open
  - Backswing: Toe-up and around
  - Body: Extension for spin
  - Result: Higher trajectory, more spin

**Low Chip Shot (Video 70)**
- **Setup Modifications**:
  - Ball back in stance
  - Narrow stance (one club width between heels)
  - Lead toe out 45°
  - Stand only one foot from ball
- **Mechanics**:
  - Forward body press on backswing
  - Shut face angle from proximity
  - No-release motion through impact
  - Leading edge contact (not bounce)

**Flop Shots (Video 95)**
- **Critical Factor**: Long & slow tempo (not setup)
- **Allows**: Club to slide under ball cleanly
- **Result**: Near-vertical launch, minimal roll

**Consistency Keys (Video 94)**
- **Match Backswing/Downswing Speeds**: Equal tempo throughout
- **Avoid**: Slow/short backswing → over-acceleration
- **Avoid**: Fast/long backswing → deceleration

### 5. Putting

*Note: Limited putting instruction in the 92 videos analyzed. Primary focus on full swing mechanics.*

## Practice Methods {#practice-methods}

### 1. Effective Practice Principles

**The #1 Reason Range Sessions Fail (Video 99)**
- **"React to Last Ball" Syndrome**: Adjusting to ball flight instead of working on movements
- **Progressive Speed Integration**: 25% → 50% → 75% → game speed
- **Feel Recalibration**: At each speed level
- **Setup Foundation**: Monitor constantly - imperceptible drifts sabotage changes
- **Feel vs Reality**: Exaggerated feels often necessary for correct movements
- **Body's Trackman**: Daily biomechanical calibration as important as ball flight
- **Parameter-Focused**: Work on 1-2 specific movements, not reactive adjustments

### 2. Feedback Methods

**Video Analysis**
- **Essential Tool**: "Film relentlessly—what you feel ≠ what you do"
- **Camera Angles**:
  - Down-the-line: Plane, positions, shoulder movement
  - Face-on: Weight shift, spine angle, rotation
  - 45-degree: Illusion correction
  - Overhead: Pelvis-arm relationships
- **Checkpoints**: Specific positions for verification
- **Comparison**: Side-by-side with tour players

**Technology Integration**
- **AMG Swing Coach App**: Real-time feedback during practice
  - Head tracking
  - Hand path monitoring
  - Parameter measurement
- **Hack Motion**: Wrist angle data
- **Trackman**: Ball flight and club delivery verification
- **Force Plates**: Ground force patterns

**Simple Feedback Tools**
- **Foot Spray (Video 87)**: Contact location on clubface
- **Tee Drills**: Attack angle and low point control
- **Impact Bag**: Release and rotation patterns
- **Mirror Work**: Setup and position verification

### 3. Drill Progression

**Pattern Learning**
- **Slow Motion**: Pattern encoding without ball
- **Progressive Speed**: Gradual increase with feel maintenance
- **Feel Development**: Exaggerated movements to find correct pattern
- **Integration**: Combine with ball striking

**Constraint-Based Learning**
- **Split-Stance Drills**: Force specific movement patterns

## Debunked Myths {#debunked-myths}

### Instruction Myths

1. **"Keep Your Head Still" (Video 23)**
   - **Myth**: Head should remain motionless
   - **Reality**: Head must move to appear stable (gimbal effect)
   - **Fix**: Work on pivot, head follows naturally

2. **"Lead with Your Elbow" (Videos 81, 82, 84, 86)**
   - **Myth**: Drive elbow in front of hip/pelvis
   - **Data**: $1.7B+ career earnings analysis - NEVER happens
   - **Reality**: Elbow moves deeper and farther BEHIND pelvis
   - **Visual Illusion**: 2D camera angles mislead

3. **"Maintain Your Posture" (Video 44)**
   - **Myth**: Keep same spine angle throughout
   - **Data**: Elite players extend 21° from address to impact
   - **Proper Term**: Extension, not early extension

4. **"Create Space" (Videos 88, 96)**
   - **Myth**: Wipe hands across body to create space
   - **Reality**: Hands stay on trail side through impact
   - **Illusion**: Hip rotation while camera stationary
   - **Data**: Trail elbow moves 8" out and around, not left

5. **"Hold Your Lag" (Video 32)**
   - **Myth**: Maintain wrist angle through impact
   - **Impossibility**: Would miss ground by 2 feet
   - **Reality**: Must release; question is when/where

6. **"Anchor Your Trail Leg" (Video 60)**
   - **Myth**: Completely restrict trail leg movement
   - **Reality**: Calibrated, controlled movement needed
   - **Curb Rash Analogy**: Fix isn't opposite extreme

7. **"Close Your Shoulders" (Video 63)**
   - **Myth**: Actively close shoulders over hips
   - **Reality**: Lazy susan - pelvis brings shoulders
   - **Pattern**: Going against generational elite data is "dicey"

### Drill Myths

1. **"T-in-Pocket" Drill (Video 38)**
   - **Popular Drill**: Keep hands close by rubbing tee in pocket
   - **Problem**: Creates hoisting, laid-off position, early extension
   - **Result**: Years of inconsistency and severe misses

2. **"Connection" Drill for Full Swings (Video 42)**
   - **Problem**: Towel/headcover under trail arm
   - **Works For**: Partial wedge shots only
   - **Harmful When**: Applied to full swings (restricts elevation)

3. **"Bow Wrist" Fix for Steep (Video 37)**
   - **Common Fix**: Bow lead wrist at top
   - **Problem**: Creates laid-off position, CAUSES steepness
   - **Result**: Compensatory moves all downswing

4. **"Shaft Extension" Drill (Video 46)**
   - **Drill**: Prevent stick from hitting side
   - **Problem**: Teaches pulling arms for shaft lean
   - **Reality**: Shaft lean is byproduct, not creation

5. **"Pause at Takeaway" Drill (Video 45)**
   - **Problem**: Creates artificial positions
   - **Result**: Club flips laid-off when speed added
   - **Compensation**: Pull, then club tips out

### Technique Myths

1. **"Straighten Trail Knee" (Video 34)**
   - **Common Teaching**: Straighten trail knee in backswing
   - **GEARS Data**: Tour players BEND knee +6° on average
   - **Pattern**: Knee switch (lead bent back, trail bent down)

2. **"Rotating Around Trail Hip" (Video 31)**
   - **Misconception**: Pelvis rotates around trail hip
   - **Reality**: Center-axis rotation in both directions
   - **Result**: Right hip moves TOWARD ball in downswing

3. **"Help It Up" with Fairway Woods (Video 67)**
   - **Myth**: Lift or scoop to get ball airborne
   - **Reality**: Zero attack angle, sweep through
   - **Tour Data**: 0-2° down maximum

4. **"Lower Trail Arm Connection" (Video 39)**
   - **Misinterpretation**: Lower trail arm during backswing for connection
   - **Reality**: Connection (adduction) ≠ lowering
   - **Truth**: Can have connection while arm elevates

5. **"Skip a Stone" for Elbow (Video 30)**
   - **Popular Feel**: Drive elbow out in front
   - **3D Reality**: Opposite of what elite players do
   - **Warning**: Coordinated golfers will perform incorrect feel, destroying swing

## Key Takeaways

### Universal Patterns from Data

1. **3D Analysis Required**: 2D video creates systematic illusions
2. **Backswing Determines Downswing**: Most faults originate in backswing
3. **Byproducts, Not Creations**: Many "positions" result from proper movements
4. **Individual Variation Exists**: Within universal biomechanical patterns
5. **Tour Player Data**: Tight tolerances despite individual styles

### AMG Philosophy

1. **Measure Don't Guess**: Technology over feels
2. **Root Cause Focus**: Fix source, not symptoms
3. **Feel ≠ Real**: Video verification essential
4. **Respect Physics**: Biomechanics and geometry constrain options
5. **Progressive Learning**: Slow integration with speed increases

### Practice Priorities

1. **Setup Foundation**: Constant monitoring prevents drift
2. **Movement Patterns**: Focus on biomechanics, not ball flight
3. **Progressive Speed**: Build from 25% to game speed
4. **Video Analysis**: Essential feedback tool
5. **Parameter Training**: 1-2 focus areas per session

### Common Threads

1. **Simplicity**: Natural movements easier than compensations
2. **Sequencing**: Lower body leads, upper follows
3. **Timing**: When > what/how much
4. **Rotation Quality**: Around center, with depth, proper tilt
5. **Width Maintenance**: "Most important real estate"
