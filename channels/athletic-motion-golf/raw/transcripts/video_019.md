A really common problem we're seeing now

[0:00:01.920 - 0:00:06.720]
for golfers that come into AMGC for

[0:00:04.240 - 0:00:08.160]
lessons is overturning the pelvis on the

[0:00:06.720 - 0:00:09.760]
back swing. And we can see that when we

[0:00:08.160 - 0:00:12.080]
measure swings and gears. Problem with

[0:00:09.760 - 0:00:13.440]
that is once they overturn their pelvis,

[0:00:12.080 - 0:00:15.200]
a lot of times they move it too much

[0:00:13.440 - 0:00:16.800]
towards a target, gets them into too

[0:00:15.200 - 0:00:19.439]
much forward bend here at the top and

[0:00:16.800 - 0:00:21.600]
gets them tilting too far back at impact

[0:00:19.439 - 0:00:23.439]
causing blocks and hooks and also

[0:00:21.600 - 0:00:25.359]
doesn't get the pelvis open enough at

[0:00:23.439 - 0:00:27.599]
impact. So what I want you to do, take

[0:00:25.359 - 0:00:29.279]
your normal stance, take your lead foot

[0:00:27.599 - 0:00:30.800]
and line it up with your trail heel.

[0:00:29.279 - 0:00:32.559]
You're going to make a back swing,

[0:00:30.800 - 0:00:34.399]
keeping some weight on that trail foot

[0:00:32.559 - 0:00:36.079]
so you feel the internal rotation to

[0:00:34.399 - 0:00:38.480]
this hip instead of backing it in

[0:00:36.079 - 0:00:40.960]
towards a target. Take it to the top.

[0:00:38.480 - 0:00:44.399]
Plant your lead foot down. Just hit an

[0:00:40.960 - 0:00:44.399]
easy shot to get a feel for
