So, we had a gentleman come in last week wanting to get more speed and he was trying more rotation. >> Longer and straighter. That's all. >> Longer and straighter is all he wanted. It's on the front door. So, what he was trying to do was more back swing rotation and more depth. What he was missing and what was really just wreaking havoc with his ability to generate speed was both of those were causing him to lose width. And by that I mean just how far we keep our hands away from the center of our body basically. >> And he had more rotation. He had too much back swing rotation. So he could check that off his list. He had his hands so far behind him. And the more I take my hands behind me, the closer my hands get to me. So he had overindex two things at the expense of the one really important thing. We say this distance between my hands and my body is the most important real estate in the golf swing. And what he was doing was overindexing his arm bend before he was exhausting his arm bend before his arm lift could kick in and it ruined his speed. >> Yeah. And his idea of moving the arm was a lot of this >> the lawnmower movement >> lawnmower move that we've preached against for many years now because it just causes so many more problems and it helps. >> He was tying himself in knots. trying to turn more, trying to get the club deeper, all that. And once we showed him what we're going to show you today, he was like, "It cannot be this easy." But it is. And that's that's the whole goal of this, right? We want good movements are easier movements. Pro movements are easier movements. Let's talk about how to make this thing easier because I know a lot of people out there watching this video are trying to do the same thing to get more speed. >> Part of the issue is if you're thinking that the arms don't really lift at all. So, if your your thought process is there's no arm lift, you're gonna kind of wrap your arms around your body and take this trail arm kind of around the rib cage too much because you're afraid to have any up and down in the arms. I'd say that's a big problem right there as far as this goes. >> Right. And again, it's it's overindexing the turn. So, I can turn more if I get my body out of positions and really start to crank. And it's going to be very natural for me to help me turn, right? Because your arms have weight, the club has weight. If I use that lever and that weight to make me turn more, I'm going to chew up all that width at the sake of getting more turn, which he could not recover from. >> Yeah. And you thought, okay, if depth at no at all costs, like if I'm trying to touch that wall right there, I'm not only going to turn, I'm also going to pull my trail arm way behind my rib cage. >> You're going to come out of posture and you're really going to reach. Right now, you've choked yourself out, we like to say. >> Yeah. Uh, exactly. And there's a parameter in the swing coach app that that shows that and I've showed people that and they're like, "Wow, I have to be out in like front of me." It's such a different feeling because they they don't understand that the turn is what provides the inward motion. You still need depth or the width with your hands and arms. >> That's exactly right. So, we're going to show you how we worked on it with him. So, we're going to have Sean set up. See if you can set up for this down the line camera. Actually, no. We'll use the Trackman. >> Okay. >> Down the line camera so you don't have to move. And we had him make chest high back swings. So basically stopped his swing at chest high and then we just had him stand up and without moving his arms res square in a talking posture. So we're going to have Sean do that. >> So if I had him go halfway back, it was something like that. >> Okay. Now resquare. >> So there's my address position. So from there, we just had him stand up and resquare his chest to the target without moving his arms. So his hands were already outside of his shoulder too early. And you got no you can't get space between your body and hands. >> Yeah. You've you've limited where you started at a dress here by bringing this around too much. >> Yes. So what we had him do was do that again. >> This is a very common motion. Yeah. I mean how many times have we done that in a lesson? >> We've done that. Now you now do the same thing and res square. Hands are basically where your glove hand is basically right in the middle of your torso. >> Yeah. And it could be off a little bit here. And the other thing to look at is making sure your right arm doesn't start going around. Those two coupled together. Too much this way and too much this way. Puts you in a very bad spot. >> Go back to that spot again. No, I'm sorry. The bad spot. >> Yep. >> So when I did this again, I'm pushing on his shoulder. So it's retracting his shoulder. What that did, if Seawn resquares again, he's got arm lift. So, he went from no arm lift to me pushing his shoulder and his hands away to arm lift, which is what he was missing. >> You make a great point. It's there. You're if you do it wrong, you actually would be lowering in relation to it's an arm lowering. >> And something that Mike did there that we do a lot, you know, he pushed my shoulder kind of back behind me and spread that angle out between my hands and my shoulder. One of the key things to that that helps a lot of people is think about moving your shoulder away from your hands instead of just pushing your hands away from your shoulder. Because if you just have a poor shoulder position here in terms of where the width would be and you just push your hands away, it doesn't really fix the problem. You can see in video how much I can move that trail shoulder but back away from my hands and that's a really good feeling if you can do that right there. Sean's hiding the his trail shoulder from the face on camera. Exactly. So do that. Switch around and do that to the down the line the big camera there. >> So if I'm like this. So if I'm pinned up here this So we see a lot of people. You can see it from this angle. I pulled my hands behind me too much. My elbow. So if I go up there and do that and then I fix it by pushing my shoulder away from my hands. You can see how different that looks compared to that in terms of where the hands are in relation to the body. much different shoulder dynamics than just trying to reach roll the shoulders forward and reach away from you. >> Yeah. So, if I showed you from this, let's say someone has this problem where they keep this shoulder kind of packed. I would call it like if I was going to arm wrestle, that's a packed shoulder. >> So, if I just push my hands away, I've seen people do this and I'm like, that's not it. >> No, >> you have to learn it's a learned it's a learned motion to pull that shoulder, retract it back so you can push away with your hands at the same time. If you can do that, it's very challenging from there not to put the club in a good spot on the down swing. >> You want your shoulders to move more than your chest. Meaning, I can rotate this chair around. Everything's turning together. But that's like turning like a block of wood. I want my shoulder retraction to be way more than my chest turn. It's like a sixth gear in the golf swing. Think when we measured it, I could get to 35. You were like at 34 degrees. That's an extra 30° of turn you're getting by just operating the shoulders correctly. >> So this shoulder goes that way and the socket would be protraction, right? And the right one retracts. Now I can have all this width with some wrist set. And if I just pivot from there, the club and the arms work down in front where they're supposed to. I'm in this great spot to hit hit from. >> So let's do one with the width. >> Okay. >> So what what do you like to do for a drill help here? holding the club shoulder width, right? >> And keeping your arms straight >> and turning the back to the target. You'll feel with the arm straight, you probably going to have to move the shoulder the right way. So, it's a straight and then slide the hand down and you almost can't mess this up. You could even start down from there. >> Yeah, cuz if you roll that trail shoulder forward, you won't be able to turn. It's >> awkward. It's very awkward. >> So, it's kind of down in the sockets here. Boom. Turn the back to the target. Make the trail shoulder disappear behind my head and then slide the hands down. And you know that's a pretty good mark of where your back swing would end up. >> All right. So, let's do that now with >> fancy >> when you reconnect and make a down swing. Just chip it out there. >> Yeah. So, normal setup. >> Yep. >> Here. Shoulders down. I'm going to turn it back to the target. Slide my hand and chip it. Okay. >> Okay. And pat my belly and rub my hand somersault. Yep. Okay, good. So, all that width, you can see his right shoulder is visible on the target side because of the retraction. This >> is a great drill. >> And then you got the width in the down swing. Yeah, that's the real estate we want to preserve. You first got to be able to get yourself in that position. And this is such a good drill. >> Yeah. One of my favorites for for learning how to do it cuz you you you can't you really can't do it wrong as long as you keep that arm straight. Keep you got to keep the arm straight. Some of you are going to go off the rails because you're just not used to making a back swing with turning. You're used to making a back swing with pulling the elbow behind you. >> Yeah. So, think about it. If if I make the box, keep the box intact. >> Yeah. >> And then slide your hand down. So, I'm keeping the box here, the rectangle intact. Slide the hands down. Swing from there. You don't need to hit a ball. Just swing through. and you'll have a whole different sense of when you start to turn, this club is going to come right down into the slot really automatically. >> Film yourself. Say it all the time. Don't rely on your intent. Don't rely on a rehearsal. Film yourself. Make sure you're doing it. Then be aware as you're doing it so you start to develop the feels. You got to earn feels, guys. If you earn the feel, you'll be able to calibrate those feels because the better you get at doing that, the less extreme it's going to feel, the more normal it's going to feel. So, you don't want to chase feels. You want to use feels based on the reality that you can play with, not just chasing, hey, Sean said it feels like this or him, so I'm going to try to do that in my swing. I want to know what it feels like to me to do the right movement. If you want another drill to help you with this movement, right?
