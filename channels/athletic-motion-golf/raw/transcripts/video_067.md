[0:00] One of my favorite tips to help people

[0:01] with fairway woods is to learn how to

[0:03] clip a golf tea off the ground. By being

[0:06] able to clip this tee off the ground,

[0:07] you have to have the club come in at a

[0:09] shallow angle of attack. Basically, call

[0:11] it a zero angle of attack. That gives

[0:12] you the best chance to catch the fairway

[0:15] wood in the right part of the face and

[0:17] launch it up in the air. And you're

[0:18] seeing a lot more fairway woods on the

[0:20] tornado as well because they're so much

[0:21] easier to hit. So, ditch your long

[0:23] irons, grab some fairway woods, and see

[0:25] if you can make a wide swing with the

[0:27] club head so you can clip this tee.

[0:30] I just was able to clip that off the

[0:32] turf. If I put a ball down, I'm going to

[0:34] try to do the same thing. I'm not going

[0:36] to try to help it up and I'm not going

[0:37] to hit down a lot. I'm going to try to

[0:39] sweep it. Pretend the tea's still there.
