[0.00] If you guys have any issues with pulls,

[3.20] right? We had two golfers that came in

[4.56] yesterday for a lesson, both pullers.

[6.32] They were missing this piece. That arm

[8.48] lowering, your shirt seam is kind of at

[10.48] an angle, right? Cuz you're bent, you're

[11.76] bent forward in golf posture. You lower

[13.44] your arm on that same angle. Now, it

[16.08] never gets looks like that in the swing

[18.24] because the body's turning.

[19.44] >> But watch what the club does as I do

[21.76] that. That's the shallowing move. It's

[23.36] not a manual shallowing. It doesn't

[25.12] require any of that. If I get up here

[26.88] and lower that arm to the rib cage

[28.48] without changing too much in my wrist

[30.48] mechanics and pivot, that club is going

[32.88] to sit on a shallow angle.
