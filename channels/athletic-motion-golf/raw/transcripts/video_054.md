[0.08s - 3.28s] You see good players go up to the top of the swing right before the club finishes. The lower body will kind of initiate a little bit,

[3.28s - 9.28s] right? Just a couple degrees. It's not a big fire. And as it goes, the lead arm will pin just a little bit more to give it a little more time.

[9.28s - 13.28s] And you're going to see the knees square up. Mhm.

[13.28s - 20.64s] By the time the the hands get, you know, not even below the waist, above the waist here, the knees will be back to square.

[20.64s - 34.88s] This is where the confusion comes in. So do do what you just did there. That was awesome. We all know now hopefully that the lower body kind of starts going from closed to open. Now, the question comes, what's the upper body doing? And we're going to talk about the shoulder. What the shoulder is doing relative to that.

[34.88s - 45.6s] This is where I think it can go off the rails. It's not like I'm trying to shut my shoulders the whole down swing. No, I'm just letting them be carried. They're going to be closed automatically to my hips as long as I don't fire. They're still going to be right at that round 40 45° closed.

[45.6s - 62.16s] I think the kiss of death is to keep it closed and yank on the arms. So, let the pelvis carry the arms. And as you do that, there's some frontal plane motion here that helps send this club downward if you get positioned right on the on the back swing.
