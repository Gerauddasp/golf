[0:00] under the microscope. Today, we're going to look at the common advice of leading

[0:01] the down swing with your trail elbow, driving your elbow in front of your

[0:03] navl, or kind of driving your elbow out in front like you're skipping a stone.

[0:05] To truly understand what's happening to the trail elbow during the swing, we're

[0:09] going to give you a camera angle you've likely never seen before. We'll move the

[0:13] camera directly above the player, positioning it 90° perpendicular to his

[0:17] pelvis, providing a precise bird's eye view. This unique perspective will allow

[0:21] you to see everything that moves in front of the player throughout his

[0:25] entire swing, regardless of his body's position or rotation. To make this even

[0:30] clearer, we'll utilize this pelvis box, which will remain perfectly square to

[0:33] and aligned with the front of his pelvis. This visual aid will instantly

[0:36] show you what is or isn't positioned in front of the player. So here at a dress,

[0:39] you can see that this multiple major champion indeed has his elbow, the blue

[0:42] dot, positioned in front of his pelvis. At this shaft parallel point in his back

[0:45] swing, it's clear that his elbow is already moved well outside his pelvis

[0:47] box. His elbow is no longer in front of him, which is primarily due to his

[0:52] shoulders rotating about 30° more than what his pelvis is rotating. Moving to

[0:54] the lead arm parallel position, his elbow continues to drift away from his

[0:56] pelvis, propelled by the increasing rotation of his shoulders compared to

[1:00] his pelvis. By the time he reaches the top, you can see that his elbow is

[1:03] nearly as deep as his right hip, marked by the red dot here. Up to this point,

[1:06] nothing might seem out of the ordinary, but this is all just setting the stage

[1:09] for what happens next in the down swing, which will contrast sharply with what's

[1:11] often taught should happen in the down swing. As we reach lead arm parallel in

[1:15] his down swing, observe how his elbow is now positioned deeper and farther behind

[1:17] his right hip. This movement results from him lowering his trail arm as his

[1:20] pelvis rotates. Yet his shoulders maintain the same close relationship

[1:22] with his pelvis that they had at the top of the swing. Time-wise, he's beyond the

[1:26] midpoint of his down swing and his elbow has shifted farther away and behind his

[1:29] hip. This is literally the opposite of what the common advice like drive the

[1:31] elbow in front, lead with the elbow, or skip a stone, or get your elbow in front

[1:35] of a navl would have you
