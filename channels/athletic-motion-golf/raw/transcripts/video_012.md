If you're topping the ball, the main reason is that your weight and your body is too far back on your trail foot here at impact. So instead of hitting into the ground like you could do when you top the ball, you end up pulling your arms closer and just nipping the top of the ball.

So, in order to fix it, what I want you to do is make sure when you start down on the down swing, you get your lead hip more forward. So, it'll feel like the weight is shifting from your right foot towards your left foot here at impact.

When you do that, you'll be able to brush the ground a little bit more forward and hit a little bit more solid shot. Something like that.

[3.28s] If you're topping the ball, the main

[5.44s] reason is that your weight and your body

[7.68s] is too far back on your trail foot here

[10.00s] at impact. So instead of hitting into

[12.16s] the ground like you could do when you

[14.64s] top the ball, you end up pulling your

[16.88s] arms closer and just nipping the top of

[18.88s] the ball. So, in order to fix it, what I

[22.08s] want you to do is make sure when you

[25.12s] start down on the down swing, you get

[27.76s] your lead hip more forward. So, it'll

[30.64s] feel like the weight is shifting from

[32.32s] your right foot towards your left foot

[34.24s] here at impact. When you do that, you'll

[36.48s] be able to brush the ground a little bit

[38.00s] more forward and hit a little bit more

[39.84s] solid shot. Something like that.
