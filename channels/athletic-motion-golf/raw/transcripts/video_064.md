[0:00] Do you know which arm is killing your

[0:01] back swing? Here's a great way to find

[0:03] out. Take two clubs, hold them just

[0:05] under the head so that you can set up at

[0:07] a dress here with the shafts about 6 in

[0:09] apart. Make your back swing and try to

[0:11] keep the shafts the same distance apart

[0:13] all the way to the top. What you're

[0:14] going to find is normally one of the

[0:16] arms will be active in a way that gets

[0:18] these shafts crossed up. So, work on

[0:21] this. If you can get them to swing up to

[0:22] the top and even start into the down

[0:24] swing and into impact, you'll start to

[0:26] train each arm separately, which goes a

[0:28] long way to making a better golf swing.

[0:30] So, once you do that a few times, bring

[0:33] your ball up here. If I can do it, try

[0:35] to feel that same thing as you take the

[0:38] club back, make a swing,

[0:41] see if you can feel it through the shot.

[0:44] I think you'll find you hit a lot better

[0:45] shots.
