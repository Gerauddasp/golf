[0:00] Drill number three is one I'm sure you've seen before. We see it a lot still done today. And I'm talking about the full swing. I've done this for a solid summer. Setting up to it. Back swing pointing at the target line. Not bad advice. No.

[0:14] But then coming down and never letting this club, the shaft extension hit me in the side for a full swing.

[0:22] Not good. Do not do that. Please do not do that.

[0:25] It's literally the opposite of what happens.

[0:27] Yeah. If that was a a sword, it would cut you right in two.

[0:29] Should cut me in half. The goal is to get shaft right by pulling the arms across you, which we've made hopefully enough videos now recently that you know that is not how shaffling is created.

[0:40] I mean, the funny part is we never even talk about shaft in a lesson.

[0:45] Two days ago, we we showed the player who had no shaft how much shaft he got at the end of the lesson.

[0:50] That's how it should work.

[0:51] But it's the byproduct. Trying to to fix these impact positions, like a drill like this is a disaster because it doesn't transfer to your golf swing.
