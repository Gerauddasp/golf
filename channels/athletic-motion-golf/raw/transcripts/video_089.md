[0:00] If you want a perfect back swing, you need to try the Gilchrist drill. I got this from Gary Gilchrist, top 50 teacher, and it's one of my favorite ones to give to students.

[0:08] You hook the club around your lead elbow and then grab the center of the shaft here with your lead hand. Put your trail hand under the shaft so your elbow is touching here, right where your elbow bends.

[0:18] Now, as you turn to the top, I want you to keep your trail elbow in contact with the shaft. If you pull the elbow away, you know you pulled your arm behind you too much.

[0:27] And the other thing that you can pay attention to is if you try to overbend, you'll feel some resistance here. So it helps you keep your trail arm at about 90 degrees, which is a good benchmark to use.

[0:37] So take that up there a few times. Feel that. Make sure your arm's not coming off. Make sure you're not over bending. Pivot. Take your arm up.

[0:43] The other thing you can feel, keep your trail arm a little more level to the ground. Don't keep it stuffed down on your rib cage.

[0:50] And then once you feel that a few times, try to make a swing feeling that same thing. I think you'll like the result. You'll have more width and hit the ball more solid.
