[0:00] If you're having some pain out there, this is probably a pretty good video to watch.

[1:12] >> And we see a lot of slide fixes as that recipe. Don't want to do that.

[2:32] >> He took out all of this action and he took his total slide and just added it to the to the front side.

[6:08] >> His hip joints are inside of his knee joints, which are inside of his ankle joints. You really don't want to stack those

[12:64] either on the back foot or the front foot. He wants to basically keep his knee on or just inside of his ankle joint coming down. You need to have a brace there. coming down. I want to avoid this kind of massive knee slide or massive hips like start to lead a little with the hips. And that's my end point right there.

[35:12] >> Last week, we had a golfer come in and he was just complaining about not hitting it solidly. And he said in our kind of little pre- lesson interview, he said he had gotten rid of his slide in the back swing, but that hasn't helped him hit the ball more solidly. And once we saw him warm up, it was easy to see why. He was oversliding in the down swing. So, he had took away the lateral motion away from the target and replaced it with way too much lateral motion towards the target. There has to be some of both.

[64:00] >> Yeah. You need to understand, you know, when you're playing golf, what's the the end ranges that you're looking to play inside of? And it's kind of a simple way to think about you just kind of play inside your feet. But there's a little more to it than that because there's a little more lateral on the down swing. But what Mike's saying is this gentleman came in,

[81:68] >> he took out all of this action, but

[84:08] >> which is good, right? You don't want to do that.

[85:92] >> He took his total slide and just added it to the to the front side. So, he was getting himself in a bad position with a lot of spine tilt to the right and we could see it on gears. Just a lot of mis hits.

[96:80] >> So, what we did throughout the lesson was show because he couldn't, you know, if you got force plates, it's easy to see or gears because you can measure all that stuff. But when he went home, he wasn't going to have any of this. So, we spent a lot of time in the lesson showing him how to visually recognize what was the proper amount. So, let's talk a little bit about the back swing because a lot of golfers fix slide in the back swing and that winds up just being overslide in the down swing.

[122:40] >> Yeah. So, I mean it depends on what club you're hitting and kind of how much, but let's just say I have an iron in my hand. You know, you don't need too much. You're basically just kind of stepping on your trail foot. You might get an inch or so here early in the back swing. And that's pretty much the end of it.

[137:04] >> Yeah, it's like a golf ball width at the most.

[139:92] >> And like Sean was alluding to earlier, if you just think of your hip joint, just keeping that inside of your ankle

[146:24] >> when the hip gets outside or even over top of the ankle for most people, that's too much, too hard to recover from.

[151:76] >> And and it can be deceptive. So, because you have to understand the more

[156:72] >> the more you turn the pelvis, it kind of narrows up, right?

[160:32] >> So, you could slide and we see this a lot. If you're looking at your swing on a on on a video from face on and you have lots of pelvis turn, you can still slide over slide away from the target and it still kind of look visually okay because you don't realize that that turn pelvis you could shift two three inches and still look like you're in a good spot. That's why you have to really pay attention to the details on this.

[184:24] >> That's exactly right. So back swing wise, I don't want to take this hip and just slide forward like that. We see a lot of slide fixes as that recipe.

[194:80] >> Don't want to do that. We want to allow the belt buckle to come over to the right side without the right side going past the ankle.

[201:36] >> Yeah. It's it's kind of learning. We've said this before is like internally rotating into this trail without like a lot of golfers are kind of we call it kind of banging the hip over and it slam

[212:80] >> ringing the bell. It's that little bell swinging and banging off the side of the inside of the right side of the bell. And a lot of you out there are probably having pain. I think you can get some just met berscitis. I know that um I've worked with people that have been diagnosed with it from oversliding one way or the other way, right?

[230:64] >> You start slamming your body into like end range on either side, you start having some pain. So if you're having some pain out there, this is probably a pretty good video to watch.

[237:84] >> Yeah. Neither one of these movements, lateral movements, overdoing them is good for rotation. So you start to put all the pressure on those joints and kind of this ring ringing the bell kind of movement.

[248:16] >> Okay. So once you get yourself sorted out in the back swing, let's really dive into the down swing. And the cool way to think about this is you've got a hip joint, you've got a knee joint, and you've got an ankle joint on your lead side. You want to keep the relationship, just narrow the gap. So Sean goes to a normal setup. He's going to have his legs angled at kind of like an A-frame.

[270:64] >> Yeah. are just just a little bit wider than my hips.

[273:52] >> Yeah. Right. So, his hip joints are inside of his knee joints, which are inside of his ankle joints. You really don't want to stack those either on the back foot or the front foot.

[282:72] >> Yeah. More of a short game,

[284:16] >> right?

[284:56] >> Setup.

[285:04] >> So, at setup, he's got that relationship. Now, as he progresses through the swing, he wants to basically keep his knee on or just inside of his ankle joint coming down. You need to have a brace there.

[297:92] >> Yeah.

[298:48] >> Going forward with the momentum.

[299:92] >> Yeah. So, you know, back swing pretty much at the top of the swing. I' got my recentering. I'm in the middle basically

[307:36] >> coming down. I want to avoid this kind of massive knee slide or massive hip slide. So, the the feeling that we like to give golfers is that once you get here and you're getting ready to change direction, your hips, the center of your hips is kind of back in the middle. Your hips are turned at this point. I'm feeling like that's the end of the forward motion with my lead side. I'm just letting my right side come towards the left.

[331:44] >> Yep.

[332:08] >> With a fairly stable left leg and then I can internally rotate into the lead hip.

[336:64] >> That's exactly right. That's the key point. The things that will undo this for you is if again you go to the top where my knee is inside my hip. Now I've got really nothing that kind of stops me when I add momentum to that and I'll slide out past it.

[351:28] >> Yeah. That this spinning hip we would call it where you're just spinning around your ankles. And a lot of you look like this. So this knee kicks in a lot

[358:80] >> because it's antislide away. It

[361:36] >> you're actually in a spot where it can cause you to overslide and get really stuck because you don't have this motion where the and you've talked about it. We've starting to look at this a lot. The distance between the knee and the center of the pelvis. You don't want to squeeze those as you're coming down. basically you're blocked and it's going to cause you to overslide instead of this nice natural leg kind of getting in a position where you can turn into the leg and then that allows the club face and the club to release.

[388:08] >> We're going to talk about this more in in following videos. That is the most common stuck in the golf swing.

[394:64] >> If you can't get open, look at that.

[396:16] >> You hear stuck in the swing and thinking about trail arm and club. We see more stuck swings because of what this femur does than anything else in the swing.

[406:00] >> Yeah.

[406:48] >> So that's essentially what Sean just showed you is getting stuck for pivot. You see early extension happen from all that. You see lack of rotation. You see too much slide.

[414:80] >> You know it's

[415:60] >> So that's the first place to look.

[416:80] >> Yeah. And this is just a detail from looking at a million golf swings. I notice it a lot with golfers that once they kind of get turned and get this, let's say the legs positioned pretty good at the top. If you overpull like that way with your foot, you might see your foot twist a little funny. That's that motion where you're you're you're pulling in the ground in a way with your foot that's causing more of that instead of like letting this knee and the hip kind of turn together a little bit. So, you can get to a point where you are braced into that.

[444:40] >> We're going to cover this in detail in a future video, but you're exactly right.

[447:68] >> Watch out for that. So, a good way to do this is to grab We've got our our plane board cushion here. Is just to grab I'm going to have Sean stand on a straight left leg so we can know where to put this. I'm going to do it actually the low side. Okay. So, put put your knee right over your ankle. So, that's straight right there. Perfect.

[464:72] >> Yeah. So, you can't really do it yet. You have to kind of like prop yourself up. That would be straight, right? Right there.

[469:36] >> Yep.

[469:92] >> Okay. Now, go to your golf stance.

[471:44] >> Yep.

[471:92] >> So, we've got a we've got a space built in now between his knee and the cushion. We've used trash cans. We've used Amazon boxes. We've used anything just to give you a feedback device. Okay. So, set up to it.

[483:20] >> Yeah.

[483:52] >> So, that's going to be Sean's wall. He can play to the wall, but we don't want him banging into the wall with either the knee or the hip.

[490:72] >> Yeah. So, back swing. I'm turning away from this leg like we talked about. It's kind of 50/50 here.

[498:08] >> Pelvis in the middle. And then coming down, I'm letting this leg start to lead a little with the hips. And that's my end point right there. And when I do that, I can feel how I'm winding into this hip now. And I get that internal rotation of the lead hip, which causes the pelvis to decelerate. And then the club can speed up basically.

[517:76] >> Now, a lot of you have played, we'll call them, high lateral movement sports, like basketball for me, infield for baseball for Sean. When I do this, it feels like there is zero lateral movement in the down swing

[531:28] >> big time,

[532:24] >> right? just because lateral movement just came so naturally for so many years. Don't be surprised if you don't feel like you're moving laterally by moving laterally the right amount,

[542:80] >> you know. And something that you have to watch out for, too. And um I'm guilty of this because it's been preached so hard over the years is overly kind of banking this back foot in it. It actually makes this trail leg straighten a little too much and it causes again it can cause this hip to get too far forward. So, you know, just make sure that that trail foot is kind of turning. So, this trail leg can turn in some, which is way different than just uh keeping the heel leading the toes a ton.

[571:76] >> Yeah. So, again, when you film your swing, and hopefully you are filming your swing, just keep an eye on the relationship between hips, knees, and ankles pretty much stay throughout the whole swing inside of those, especially as the stance gets wider and the club gets longer.

[585:84] >> Now, yeah. And as I'm going to make a little mini swing here as you as you swing it through, you know, you you want to balance up on that leg, you might have your hip in front of the foot just a little bit with full body extension. But so just be careful that you're not going this way,

[599:76] >> right?

[600:08] >> Once your once your hip gets up to the wall here, the right one meets it instead of the right one backing away. That's just a key point cuz you don't want to be throwing the baby out with a bath water with any of this stuff, especially the forward lateral motion. Just the key is you're creating this

[616:40] >> stable base that you can turn into like you do in the back swing turn into the trail leg. You've got to turn into this lead leg at some point rather than continuing on down the fairway which is a recipe for inconsistency with face angle distance control and fat thin chuts.

[632:56] >> We're not supposed to do any of those.

[635:76] >> If you want another drill to help you cure the slide, we'll either do a slide. This drill will be worked for the back swing or down swing.
