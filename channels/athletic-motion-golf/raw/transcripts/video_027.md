[0:00] One of the most common questions we get asked online is, "How can I stop swaying in the back swing?" Now, most of you think of swaying as moving laterally away from the target too much in the back swing, and that's an issue for a lot of golfers. We also now in the last couple years seen a trend of swaying the other way. That's also a big issue. So, moving the pelvis this way is equally damaging to your swing. We don't want either version of those. Instead, we want to move the pelvis correctly. It's a I know it's a novel concept, but instead of doing the extremes, let's just do it correctly.

[0:36] >> Exactly. Just telling somebody to kind of move this hip behind them to fix sway, you you've gone so far in the other direction that you create a whole another set of issues.

[0:46] >> That's a great point. That's a swing cue a lot of golfers have told us, they've been told to do is to add address. My belt buckle's here in the middle of my stance. take my right hip, put it behind my belt buckle, which is this, which is a sway towards the target

[1:00] >> and super contorted. You'd almost have to turn your hips 90 degrees.

[1:03] >> Well, you see the straightening of the right leg, which we know doesn't happen. You get all those things. That's not a fix for over swaying the other way.

[1:13] >> No.

[1:13] >> So, you don't want to fix one issue with a problem.

[1:17] >> Exactly.

[1:17] >> I don't want to fix a hook with a slice. And before you go, we go too far here, you know, this corresponds to other videos we've shot. Your lower body will actually respond to what your upper body does. So, if you're in good shape, right about halfway back, but then you're trying to maybe tilt the or extend the upper body in to finish the top of the back swing, that will also kick your hip. That's a super common sway.

[1:39] >> Super common. Trying to keep the head relatively centered and trying to add some speed and get some movement going. We see a lot of we call it ringing the bell,

[1:48] >> right? where the the we had to look it up. A little bell inside of a bell, a little ball inside of a bell is called the clapper.

[1:55] >> So it's like dong dong doing that. We don't want to do that either.

[1:58] >> No.

[1:59] >> So instead, what is a good pelvis movement do?

[2:02] >> So we've talked about this before. You know, you're trying to internally rotate the hip instead of just spinning the pelvis. There's two different ways to look at it, right? You can either spin the pelvis or you can internally rotate into the trail hip and do work at the actual hip joint. So, the way to feel it is to feel like you're turning your belt buckle into your upper part of your your trail leg here without sacrificing the angle of this leg. So, you may get a little bit like I have an angle to my trail at address. It's angled inward slightly.

[2:33] >> In the first part of the takeaway, you may get that straightening up a little just because there's that just little shift into the trail leg to get things moving. By the time you get to the top, you're going to be back where you started on that angle and your belt buckle is going to be turned into that leg in this manner and that means you've rotated correctly.

[2:49] >> So if I'm again, the belt buckle is a great cue. So if my belt buckle starts, if I don't have a weird setup in either direction, I'm just kind of 50/50 or 55 45, my belt buckle is going to be roughly center of my stance somewhere thereabouts. I've got to move my belt buckle to the right to not sway to not That's too much to the right and certainly that's moving it to the left. That's a sway either way. So, I've got to let it move to the right. And while I keep angle to this leg, not super complicated. Now, we'll put gears on the screen. The dot for gears, right? You've seen our videos before, is it goes on the outside of the the body, right? Just right to the body. And then we can also show the hip joint. You're going to see those movements. The hip will go back and in a little bit if I move my belt buckle basically to the inside of my ankle. That's the proper hip movement by just thinking belt buckle off center to the inside of my foot. Not that movement and not that movement. It's a really really simple movement to make.

[3:56] >> Yeah. And the thing that can throw it off, again, be cognizant of what you're doing upstairs here. Because if you start to go too much, shoulder to the ground, start trying to lean your spine, extending too much, that's a kicking motion of the lower body. Remember, everything's interrelated. Everything counts.

[4:14] >> So, if you're doing something up here and putting something in that's causing this to go right, you got to figure out the direction of this upper body motion, too. All this stuff has to work together.

[4:24] >> Now, this be a little tough love. A lot of you are under the impression that, oh, why you show pro movements? Because I'm not a pro and they're super flexible. No, this is physically so much more difficult to do ringing the the bell or even doing this than just taking your belt buckle and doing this. Like, who who watching this video cannot make this movement? So, we don't want to hear this is a pro move. It's too difficult to do.

[4:50] >> That's been passed over many moons ago.

[4:50] >> The good movements are physically easier to do. So, a drill that we like to do for this, and this is super easy to train, is I'm just going to set an alignment stick down. We'll use this camera over here to be the middle of my stance. Okay. So, I'm going to straddle this equally, and I'm going to use my club as kind of a plumb bob here. So, I'm going to take it right on my belt buckle, make a pivot so it shifts over, doesn't go past me. We don't want to do that.

[5:15] >> I'll hold a club here against your right hip.

[5:17] >> Okay. So, I'm just going to move it this way.

[5:19] >> That's it.

[5:19] >> That's it. He's turned inside over.

[5:22] >> My hips have turned roughly 45 degrees. I haven't flattened my hips and overc cranked them. I haven't shoved my belt buckle. Whoops. My belt buckle hasn't gone forward. That overturns my hips. Again, it it's so difficult to convince golfers a lot of times to do less because we all think we're not doing enough of the right movements. Sometimes we're just doing poor movements too much.

[5:47] >> So, we're going to go here. there. If you can do that, do it with your eyes closed a few times. Do it with your arms, upper body now, and then start doing a swing in the club. Now you have a worldclass pelvis movement. It's literally this simple.

[6:02] >> Yeah. When you start stacking good lower body movements, good upper body movements, and you learn the arms and on the wrist action, you're building a swing that's going to last because it's you're building the good foundational pieces. And this movement, moving my belt buckle across to the inside of my ankle, is going to move your pelvis. It's going to sway your pelvis in 3D roughly/ inch to an inch and a half depending on how wide your hips are, all those sorts of things and all that.

[6:28] >> It's going to move it and then it's going to shift back as you recenter and then on through the other side. Like that's how easy it is to make good pelvis movements. The pelvis is so important because everything above it, like Sean was just alluding to, becomes affected if the pelvis movement is poor. So, get a plumb bob, get a alignment stick, you these two tools or a camera, you've got everything you need to do to build a high caliber elite pelvis movement pivot in your golf swing.
