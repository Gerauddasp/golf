[0.16s] Leading with the elbow is at best an

[2.24s] illusion, but mainly just a myth. These

[4.56s] players have won over a staggering $1.7

[7.359s] billion with a B playing this great

[10.32s] game. And out of all those players, we

[12.16s] haven't found one yet that leads with

[14.4s] the elbow or skips a stone or drives

[16.72s] their elbow in front of their navl on

[18.56s] the down swing or any other version of

[20.64s] that same technique. However, what all

[22.8s] those players do have in common is they

[24.88s] lower their trail arm towards the

[26.72s] outside of their trail hip and they keep

[29.039s] it there into and well past impact.

[31.84s] Lowering your arm might be the simplest

[33.76s] and physically easiest move in golf, far

[36.64s] easier than trying to force the elbow in

[38.719s] front, requiring a simultaneous external

[41.6s] rotation of your shoulder, which is

[43.52s] something else that doesn't happen in

[44.879s] the swings of great players. So to wrap
