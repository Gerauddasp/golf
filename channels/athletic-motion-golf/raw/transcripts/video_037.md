Last week, we had a gentleman come see us for a half-day lesson. He was struggling with being steep in the down swing, and he was correctly diagnosing a swing because he was steep. What he didn't understand was that he was making a movement to try to fix steep that was actually causing the steep. And what he was doing was going to the top of his swing and really bowing his wrist, getting his elbows together and bowing his wrist. You can see from this down the line camera that that really lays the club face off. So, as soon as you pull on the shaft, it stands it up. And then he was trying to save it by thrusting the hips forward and really getting the body up and out of the way to kind of drop it under late. He was a good enough golfer to do that on occasion. Like he said, he'd be plugging along pars pars pars and then boom, out of bounds. It's out of nowhere. And he was like, I don't know why I'm on so inconsistent. When you do that movement, you you're loading one of those OB balls in the chamber. Th this particular topic is a good one and I like discussing the lessons that we've had because this will help a whole lot of people. You know, this might not be for everybody, but this one video alone will help somebody to the point where they're like, "Hallelujah, I needed this." And that's why we're doing these. So, let's just say you got an orthodox grip normal. And your idea to fix your slice is to bow the wrist. Okay?

So, you take it up to the top and you start to bow the wrist. So, you know, the average for really great players is slightly extended at the top of the back.

It's a little bit of cup.

Yeah. And then there's the movements of the body and the way the club moves will flatten it out some, but it's a little bit of cup, which oh, by the way, allows you to get the club, we call it propped up between the arms, which is key for lowering the club down and letting it shallow. what you're doing, you're baking in an extra move that causes the club to normally go in the laid off direction and it it points the club to the sky, right? So, when I do that, club to the sky, laid off, unless I put in an extra move because any club that's tip laid off, the force that I'm putting on the club is kind of like down and out, right? That's everybody. I don't It's If you're going to hit a ball, that's where I was going. You ain't going that way and you're not going that way. If I do that to a club that's kind of laid off and below my hands, let's just say somewhere in there, and I pull on that, you can see what that does. So, you're putting in a move that's making the steep happen, unless you put another move in there, and you're making things more complicated. You're not really fixing the real issue of why you got steep in the first place. You're actually making it worse.

Now, you can do this at home. Put your arm parallel to the ground. Okay? Now, I want you to focus on the the top of your forearm. Don't let it rotate. Okay, this is going to be key. Arm up. Don't let that rotate. And just bow your wrist. You're going to feel that club start to pull. I'm trying not to let this rotate, but I can see it moving because there's so much mass now away from this joint that it's really pulling that arm forward. Now, if I do that at the top of the swing,

I've got the club dipping and pulling me this way, like you said, maybe you can go with it,

put another move in,

which is going to drop it under. Or what 99% of you are going to do is resist that by adding a torque to hold that club up. Now, I've got I've built in a steepening move that's going to show up way too early. And this is why we love teaching this swoosh sickle, whatever you call it, where the club tracks back toward the club head tracks back toward you some. If you're trying to do that, but then put a bow in there, you're doing a late flop of the club head, we call it. It's the flopping away and dropping. If I kept letting the club go, it would hit somewhere there. Right?

If you let the club go, it should hit somewhere over here. Think about a John Dailyaly. He did it perfectly. He clicked the club around the clock. Now, if I throw a boeing action in there, I've added in something that's making me have to make another compensating move. So, if I pull on that, it's going to tumble the face. If I do that and it tumble, it's going to be so close that like Mike said, I have to put another again another move in. Can you play like that? Obviously, a lot of things depend on the grip and the anatomy of how you move and everything. But the most breadandbut way to play is just feel like you make a fist up there with a fairly neutral grip and you got it just about right and you can hit every shot from there. That's the fix. Because adding a movement that requires more movements to offset that in the down swing for most of us is not going to pan out like we think it's going to, right? We're not trying to do more in the down swing. We're not trying to recover from something we do in the back swing. The down swing is a reaction to your back swing. So this club's on that kind of you just imagine it working on that kind of swing plane. It's called a plane of glass. And I go I get it working well. and I just jam it through and bust that plane of gas. It's got to go back out the other way to get it back on plane. I can't just keep circling it back in there. It's it's it's it's going to be disaster for you. So, I love the analogy of kind of making a punch up there at the top. Explain to everyone what you're talking about with that and how we can train that.

Little mini grip lesson. Just stick the club behind you here and grab it. You could also put it off to your side and just let your arm hang. That'll give you kind of the right amount of rotation in your your your hand here when you grip it. If I take that up and punch and make a turn and then punch the air and put my other hand on it, that puts me in a really good spot with a strong wrist position that when I start down, it may flatten a little before it goes back into extension, which is a natural kind of wrist flow pattern instead of me having it here and having to fight it to keep it from tumbling out over. So, just to put it on your shoulder, turn fist, put your other hand on, start down. You'll be amazed how good that looks.

You took my words right out of my mouth like this is one of our favorite drills. Put the club on your shoulder. Turn to the top and kind of punch up and back. So, I wouldn't punch this way or this way. Punch up and back. And you're going to have either a flattish or slightly cupped wrist. Maybe one or two degrees bow, but anything but that. You're going to really struggle with where this mass starts to go. When you have that mass veering off its track in the back swing, you've got to make up for it in the down swing.

Yeah. And one more little thought processor that I've used, we've used to help people in lessons, like if I if I put my left arm up in front of me and I keep this flat, the face will be turned away just a little bit with a good looking grip. If I just set this stick like this and swing that up there, I don't want to get too far off of this because I've got to when I pull on it, it's going to go through that again. So, if you could just get up there and keep this

Well, your stick should have some angle to it. So, if you just flopped it down, your stick would get you let let it stay down. Your stick would get too flat.

Exactly. That's not what we're after.

You're getting away from that alignment. And that alignment, if I pull on it and it's in a good spot, comes right down here in line with the hands at checkpoint six and we're releasing on through. So, that's just something we've used over the years to help people. So, a bow wrist isn't a fix for poor club face, poor, you know, you can have a strong grip, but have the club face open, have the club open in your grip. It's not a fix for that. It's not a fix for steep in the down swing. In fact, a lot of time it feeds steep in the down swing. Make sure I love that alignment stick across the form. Make sure you've got that going into the top correctly. You're going to see yourself having to make such far more simpler movements to make a good swing. We're trying to make it easy on you. And if you have time to hit a thousand balls a day, you can do try to do whatever you want. You may figure it out. But if you're like most of us, build something that's kind of neutral, breadand butter that allows you to hit all the shots. You don't have any holes in your game. The fist at the top is a good one. We've used for a long time. And these are things that we've used. Yes, we do have a YouTube channel. We're also real instructors. We have real people.

We're real life people. You can't some of these ideas that you see over the years online if they don't hold up with someone standing in front of you. You got to put something in somebody's head that's standing in front of you that works.

So if you start teaching a lot over the years, we've given thousands and thousands and thousands of lessons. You start figuring out what helps people quickly and they can hang on to for a long time. And this has been a staple over the years. Make that fist. Get the club in a good spot going into the top as it starts coming back at you. when you pull on that club, oh, by the way, it lays behind you more. You can do all those things. So, that's what we're getting at. Somewhere in the middle of the road works. Now, if you're inconsistent, maybe this isn't your fault. You don't have a bow wrist, but if you're inconsistent and not happy with that, click on the link in the first pin comment below. and got another drill to help you
