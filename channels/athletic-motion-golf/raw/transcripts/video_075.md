[0.16s] the difference between how we try to

[2.08s] deliver an iron and how we try to

[4.48s] deliver a driver. Now, most golfers are

[6.879s] understanding of the angle of attack

[8.88s] difference, right? Downward angle attack

[10.96s] with the irons, upward angle attack with

[12.48s] a driver, but there's something else

[14.32s] that really keeps golfers from driving

[15.92s] the ball well. probably one of the main

[17.76s] reasons you start struggling with the

[19.439s] driver.

[20.32s] >> Um especially as you start getting

[22.32s] better as a player, it's having too much

[24.88s] of this handle forward with impact

[27.519s] because kind of the trend now is

[28.88s] everybody get this handle way out in

[30.48s] front. If you do it with a driver, it

[32.079s] can be disastrous because you either

[33.92s] going to hit blocks or overt twist the

[35.6s] handle and start hitting low hooks and

[37.12s] neither one of those are very fun,

[38.399s] >> right? So you've the to average for

[40.399s] shaft lean, forward shaft lean with

[42.079s] irons right around 8°, right? Which is

[44.559s] great for an iron. you want to

[45.76s] decompress it and and get the launch you

[48.079s] want. It's not that way with a driver.

[49.84s] We want basically zero. We want that

[51.84s] shaft vertical to about one one two

[54.48s] degrees max. So pretty vertical.
