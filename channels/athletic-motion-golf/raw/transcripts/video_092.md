## Raw Transcript

[0.08s] If you're fatting or scooping your

[1.52s] irons, this drill will help a lot. So,

[3.44s] basically, you put your impact bag down

[5.28s] here that you can get off our website.

[7.20s] And what you're trying to do is hit the

[9.92s] bag, but put on the brakes, but you're

[12.08s] going to try to feel like the trail side

[14.24s] of your hip is coming around to bring

[16.08s] the club to the bag. That's a lot

[18.16s] different from a lot of you are just

[19.36s] pulling on your arms and having to scoop

[21.44s] because the body's not working

[22.72s] correctly. The other thing you can do

[24.08s] here when you pop the bag is make sure

[25.76s] you have a little twist on the grip here

[27.76s] so that you can square the face. Cuz if

[29.36s] you've had shaft lean and you've never

[30.88s] had it before, you're going to leave the

[32.08s] face open. So the little Golf Pride logo

[34.08s] here, my grip. As I'm coming in, make

[35.92s] sure I have a little twist. And I'm

[37.60s] going to put the brakes on to feel the

[40.40s] impact.
