## Raw Transcript

[0:00] improve your swing dramatically by doing

[0:01] this one drill.

[0:02] >> And you know, at a dress when you grip

[0:04] it, it'll be off your forearm a little

[0:06] bit here, right? And it'll be kind of

[0:08] unccocked. So, this part of the hanger

[0:10] will be on your forearm. Now, I like it

[0:12] because as you swing back, it'll kind of

[0:14] stay on your left forearm. And this

[0:16] actually has a BB in it. So, you get a

[0:17] two for one with this drill. This this

[0:19] club actually has a BB that's floats up

[0:21] and down. So, you're going to float that

[0:23] BB into the grip, right? And as I come

[0:26] down here, I I need to let that VB shoot

[0:31] that way. But I'm trying to do it while

[0:34] still maintaining a little bit of

[0:35] pressure here on this hanger. Now, it'll

[0:37] finally come off and get on the right

[0:38] forearm, especially as it swings up

[0:40] here. It'll be on the right forearm

[0:41] through here. You can see that this part

[0:44] of the hanger is behind my forearm.

[0:46] Basically,

[0:48] >> look how much it moves as the top part

[0:51] flips over to square it. It's you're not

[0:54] holding it. And then doing this motion,

[0:56] it actually un cocking it this way. And

[0:59] let the body turn and some forearm

[1:01] rotation.
