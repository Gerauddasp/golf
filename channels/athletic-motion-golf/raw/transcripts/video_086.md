[0.08s] another top pro, illustrating the
[1.92s] illusion and debunking the myth. Pro
[3.92s] number two is also a former world number
[6.00s] one and multiple major champion. He's
[8.24s] often highlighted as the prototype
[10.00s] example of someone who leads with their
[11.92s] elbow or gets their elbow quickly in
[14.08s] front of their center line in the down
[15.92s] swing. At address, he too also has his
[18.08s] elbow well inside of his pelvis box. At
[20.40s] checkpoint number two, he isn't as
[22.24s] rotated with his shoulders, which
[24.32s] positions his elbow still barely inside
[26.64s] of his box, but it's still in front of
[28.32s] him. By the time he reaches checkpoint
[30.32s] three, his elbow is no longer in front
[32.64s] and for the first time outside of his
[34.64s] box. As he hits the top, pro number
[36.72s] two's movement start to mirror what we
[38.64s] saw with pro number one. with his elbow
[41.36s] moving further outside and drawing
[43.84s] deeper towards his right hip. By
[45.84s] checkpoint number five, which is well
[47.60s] beyond the midpoint of his down swing,
[49.76s] his elbow was moved even farther outside
[52.08s] his box and deeper towards his hip.
