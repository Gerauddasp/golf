[0.08s - 2.72s] do this drill if you struggle to hit

[1.6s - 4.72s] your fairway woods.

[2.72s - 5.04s] >> I'll just take a tea and get out of the

[4.72s - 6.64s] way

[5.04s - 8.16s] >> on the mat here is perfect because it'll

[6.64s - 9.76s] sit kind of flush. It's not up on the

[8.16s - 11.759s] grass or anything. So, if you have a mat

[9.76s - 13.599s] at your house, this is great practice

[11.759s - 15.28s] just for kind of the low point of where

[13.599s - 16.72s] the club bottoms out and how much it's

[15.28s - 18.72s] coming down and the angle it's coming

[16.72s - 21.6s] down. So, what you're trying to do here

[18.72s - 24.48s] is make a swing where you can clip that

[21.6s - 26.8s] tee without banging into the ground or

[24.48s - 28.16s] breaking the tea. So, you couldn't do

[26.8s - 29.84s] anything like this, right? Because you

[28.16s - 31.76s] would snap the tee. You can't do

[29.84s - 34.16s] anything like this because you can't get

[31.76s - 36s] to the tea. So, you have to kind of sw

[34.16s - 37.76s] have a kind of a widish arc with the

[36s - 39.36s] club so it just kind of lines up for

[37.76s - 40.64s] impact. You don't want to be doing this.

[39.36s - 42.879s] You're trying to get this ball up in the

[40.64s - 46s] air, right? So, I'll just make a couple

[42.879s - 48.079s] of practice swings trying to feel that

[46s - 49.44s] just barely brush the grass like that.

[48.079s - 52.64s] And I'll get in there and I'll see if I

[49.44s - 52.64s] can do one kind of slow.
