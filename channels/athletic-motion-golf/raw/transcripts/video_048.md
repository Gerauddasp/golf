## Video Description

If your hips aren't opening up like they should — this lesson will show you exactly why… and what to do about it.

In this swing breakdown with Mike Granato and Shaun Webb from Athletic Motion Golf, we use the Gears Golf 3D system to measure and correct one of the most common problems amateur golfers face: not getting open enough at impact.

If you've dealt with a trail leg that collapses, hips that stall, and too many left-side misses. In this video, Mike and Shaun walk me through real data from Gears — and show me why my knee movement was killing my hip rotation… and what to feel instead.

This isn't theory or guesswork — you'll see the numbers on screen:
• Pelvis rotation
• Trail knee movement
• Rotation imbalances
• Clubface control issues

And the exact cues and feels to fix them.

Whether you're a competitive golfer or just want to stop flipping and start compressing… this swing fix is a total unlock. Especially if you're over 40, tight in the hips, or struggling to get more open without losing balance.

We're not "trying to rotate more" — we're learning how to move the trail leg so the pelvis can finally clear. The difference was instant… and measurable.

## Key Topics Covered

1. **Trail Leg Collapse Issue**
   - Common problem among amateur golfers
   - Prevents proper hip rotation
   - Leads to left-side misses and flipping

2. **Gears 3D Data Analysis**
   - Pelvis rotation measurements
   - Trail knee movement patterns
   - Rotation imbalances quantified
   - Clubface control metrics

3. **The Core Problem**
   - Right knee collapse during downswing
   - Creates imbalance between knee and pelvis rotation
   - Prevents hips from clearing properly
   - Affects golfers over 40 and those with hip tightness

4. **The Solution**
   - Proper trail leg movement pattern
   - Not about "trying to rotate more"
   - Learning how to move trail leg so pelvis can clear
   - Instant and measurable improvement

5. **Practice Application**
   - Starting at lower speed to establish pattern
   - Before/after rotation comparisons
   - Matching pro-level hip numbers
   - Locking in the correct feel
   - Why generic "just get open" advice doesn't work

6. **Benefits of Measured Feedback**
   - Visual data provides clear targets
   - Eliminates guesswork
   - Creates repeatable patterns
   - Helps maintain balance while opening up

## Target Audience

- Golfers struggling with hip rotation
- Players with trail leg collapse issues
- Golfers over 40 with hip tightness
- Anyone experiencing left-side misses
- Players who flip at impact
- Competitive golfers seeking data-driven improvement
