[0.08s - 3.28s] As you get to your fairway woods, three

[1.68s - 4.96s] wood, fivewood, seven wood, you know,

[3.28s - 6.40s] with the advent of Trackman, we can

[4.96s - 7.52s] actually see what really good players do

[6.40s - 9.44s] with these clubs. And they're pretty

[7.52s - 10.32s] much a zero angle of attack, maybe

[9.44s - 12.40s] slightly down.

[10.32s - 14.40s] >> The faster players go creep down a

[12.40s - 15.60s] couple degrees, but pretty neutral.

[14.40s - 17.36s] >> For the average player, you're trying to

[15.60s - 19.28s] get a zero angle of attack. And you're

[17.36s - 21.68s] that means you're trying to contact that

[19.28s - 23.12s] ball at the very bottom of the arc,

[21.68s - 24.80s] right? It's not coming down. It's not

[23.12s - 26.80s] coming up. You just got right at the

[24.80s - 28.24s] bottom. You want to try to feel the

[26.80s - 29.84s] entire, you know, you're brushing the

[28.24s - 32.56s] sole of the club right there where the

[29.84s - 35.04s] ball is and you just barely tickle the

[32.56s - 36.96s] the grass there and that ball will hit

[35.04s - 38.64s] in the right part of the face, right?

[36.96s - 40.00s] which is kind of just up from this the

[38.64s - 42.48s] bottom groove here up towards the middle.
