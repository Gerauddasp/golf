We probably use it in every lesson for this particular topic is, you know, you want to put your knees up against it or your feet up against it. So you when you get in your dress position here, you'll have some space here. >> So you basically got a little more than a club head there. And that's that's the space you can use or should use for this. >> As you take it up to the top, your lead knee will kind of just brush it. You don't want to blast through it. And then coming down, what you're going to feel like is that the the knees are going to change, but this right one will start to bend, right? They match here somewhere halfway down because this one's starting to straighten as this one's bending. The left one straightens, which gets more space. But as that's happening, you got to let the trail knee get into the board and kind of slide against the board. So, it's kind of going towards a target.

[0.16s - 1.68s] Watch this video if you are having
[1.68s - 3.28s] troubles with your trail leg.
[3.28s - 4.64s] >> What do we use this for? We use it for a
[4.64s - 5.2s] lot of things.
[5.2s - 6.64s] >> Yeah, it's like Swiss Army knife of
[6.64s - 8.24s] training aids. We probably use it in
[8.24s - 10.48s] every lesson for this particular topic
[10.48s - 11.84s] is, you know, you want to put your knees
[11.84s - 13.28s] up against it or your feet up against
[13.28s - 14.799s] it. So you when you get in your dress
[14.799s - 16.08s] position here, you'll have some space
[16.08s - 16.56s] here.
[16.56s - 18.48s] >> So you basically got a little more than
[18.48s - 20.16s] a club head there. And that's that's the
[20.16s - 22s] space you can use or should use for
[22s - 22.48s] this.
[22.48s - 24.08s] >> As you take it up to the top, your lead
[24.08s - 25.519s] knee will kind of just brush it. You
[25.519s - 27.519s] don't want to blast through it. And then
[27.519s - 28.96s] coming down, what you're going to feel
[28.96s - 31.279s] like is that the the knees are going to
[31.279s - 33.68s] change, but this right one will start to
[33.68s - 35.36s] bend, right? They match here somewhere
[35.36s - 37.04s] halfway down because this one's starting
[37.04s - 38.96s] to straighten as this one's bending. The
[38.96s - 41.2s] left one straightens, which gets more
[41.2s - 42.96s] space. But as that's happening, you got
[42.96s - 45.44s] to let the trail knee get into the board
[45.44s - 47.2s] and kind of slide against the board. So,
[47.2s - 48.96s] it's kind of going towards a target. If
[48.96s - 51.28s] I do it from this direction, you can see
[51.28s - 53.12s] as I start to come down, it hits the
[53.12s - 55.44s] board and slides toward the target and
[55.44s - 57.12s] ends up, it depends on the stance with,
[57.12s - 58.719s] but kind of matching the lead knee here
[58.719s - 62.48s] on the side of the the lead Like
