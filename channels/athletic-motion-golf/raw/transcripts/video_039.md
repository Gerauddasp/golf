[0.16s - 4.24s] So many amateurs that we see will actually lower the arm. So if I'm at

[2.48s - 8.56s] address, right, I've got that much arm lift, they'll lower the arm in the back

[28.72s - 44.96s] this arm, as you turn back, >> it starts to elevate to get this club up

[30.40s - 50.24s] in a good spot. That's the first part of the sequence is getting the arm to work
