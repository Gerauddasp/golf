[0.08s - 3.60s] Fix your hip movement with this drill.

[1.92s - 6.08s] You can just set up in your living room

[3.60s - 8.16s] with your trusty plane board here behind

[6.08s - 10.72s] you and on the back swing. The right

[8.16s - 12.64s] side will get into the board here coming

[10.72s - 14.16s] down. You know, a lot of guys will get a

[12.64s - 15.28s] little gap right here in transition just

[14.16s - 17.44s] because they're, you know, there's some

[15.28s - 20.48s] of that kind of tucking of the rear end

[17.44s - 23.28s] going on there, the u the posterior

[20.48s - 25.28s] tilt, right? And then as they straighten

[23.28s - 26.80s] their leg, this side naturally the lead

[25.28s - 28.40s] side naturally goes back towards the

[26.80s - 29.44s] board. It doesn't need to slam into it.

[28.40s - 29.84s] Just somewhere near it,

[29.44s - 31.52s] right?

[29.84s - 33.68s] As the right one comes off. So, don't

[31.52s - 35.44s] get in this idea that you have to play

[33.68s - 38.00s] behind that

[35.44s - 40.56s] tush line at a dress. Just somewhere

[38.00s - 42.80s] near it without shoving back. And it'll

[40.56s - 44.32s] go a long ways towards making a more

[42.80s - 46.48s] natural movement which is better for

[44.32s - 46.48s] everybody.
