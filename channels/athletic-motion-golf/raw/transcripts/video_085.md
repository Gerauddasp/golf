how to gain 20 yards. Growing up in that generation of getting off the lead foot transition where he would start to get his hip out past his knee. That's death. >> Yeah. We call it the knee kick in. Right. Letting my pelvis kind of pull on my upper leg here. >> I've got something to push against. I've got a brace here which was really what produced the speed form. >> Exactly. And you see so many golfers doing it just in the name of like let me lift the foot. We're going to show you today what we showed a a golfer in one of our schools recently. How to gain 20 yards. We're talking about carry, not you hit the cart path and get another 20 yards and roll out. How to gain 20 yards. And it had to do with how he was swinging his driver or applying his left side of his lower body, the left leg in kind of the transition and down swing. Let's jump right into it and let's have Shawn go to the top. We're going to first show you what he was doing. And again, this is not unique to him. He was a good player actually. This is not unique to him. We see golfers every week do this. >> And a lot of it's being taught. So >> yes, >> that you got to understand that too. Like you might be watching videos and they're teaching this. So we'll try to clear the air today is using these force plates as an example how you get the most ground force, >> right? So, the golfer was he was um mid-50s, I think 57, and he was taught, you know, growing up in that generation of getting off the lead foot and really getting that heel off the ground to get a bigger turn. So, at the top of his swing, we'll have Seawn do his best demonstration of that. his trail knee moved in quite a bit to where his trail femur was pretty vertical and he even had some swings where he tried to get after it where that that knee would get past vertical get narrow stance to it he was even more inward than that >> right so put yourself in that position at the top >> so the knee was kicked in about like that >> he would so his transition where he would start to get his hip out past his knee >> and a lot of golfers do that >> that's death that is going to be basically turning off your lower body to generate speed and relying on just your upper body to try that. So, a lot of effort and not much payoff for that. >> Exactly. And you see so many golfers doing it just in the name of like, let me lift the foot because I think that's going to allow me to get more club head speed. Well, no, not necessarily because if you do it in the wrong way and like Mike said, kick this leg in. When you start down and kind of back in, if your hips get out over your left foot too much with this knee in, you basically blocked yourself and lose the ability to generate these good forces under your feet. >> Right? So, the first thing we had him do was go to the top of his swing. And again, you're still going to be turned. This left knee is still going to bend about twice as much as where it starts from, but your hip, knee, and ankle are going to be much more in alignment than they are out of alignment. >> Yeah. We call it the knee kick in. Right. So, if I take this to the top, I'm feeling like I'm letting my pelvis kind of pull on my upper leg here. So, like Mike said, I get this line looking more like this. Right. >> Yes. >> This way. My hips are still inside my right foot at the top. You know, I've already recentered a little, but I in no way am I kicking this in where my rear end or my pelvis would kind of kick on the other side um of where my knee is. >> And the reason this is important is exactly what he was doing in his downswing. So he would get it in here, kick in, and when he shifts forward, there was no nothing stopping him with his hip just running down the fairway. So he'd always come into impact kind of real soft knees like this. And again, he was just trying to time with his irons especially how much arm to let out so we didn't hit it fat or thin. But with his driver, he just you could not generate the speed that he was physically capable of with your knee in a line to the hip and ankle. Now, when I start down, I've got something to push against. I've got a brace here, which was really what produced the speed form. >> Yeah. So, we widen out his stance, right? That's one thing. He need to stance um quite a bit wider than what a lot of people think. Definitely outside the width of the hips. You have your a >> his were basically almost inside his hips. >> Yeah. He he thought it would let him turn more, but >> and he could turn more doing that, but it didn't help him. >> Instability at that point with the feet too close together. So, wider stance. I feel like I'm make I'm turning the pelvis away from this leg more. So, I get this kind of more alignment this way. And then kind of the key move here when I start down is to make this move. And you always talk about getting that shin kind of vertical but keeping the the top part of the hip here inside of the ankle. You want to talk about that for a second? >> Yeah. So, if you just again think of the three dots of middle of the ankle, middle of the knee, middle of the hip, and not not like the outside of your pants, but right in that hip joint. So at the top, you want those fairly much in line. >> In line this way, right? >> Yeah. Just kind of in line that it's going to be at an angle. And then what Sean was just saying, I'm trying to get my knee over my ankle now and keep my hip joint inside of that so I can really use that twisting and pushing all those cool ground forces to generate speed. I can take advantage of those now and really create a brace or breaks to hit from, which when you start to do that and apply that vertical force, now you're really kicking up the club head speed, which was like a night and day difference for him. >> And and it ties into something that, you know, I've learned from Fast Eddie hits driver here. In case anybody wants to ever take a look at these, we'll put it in one of the links. But the fact that from the top, be very careful of rolling this ankle in too much because it can shove you down the fairway too much and straighten this trail leg out too soon. >> Right? >> So, the feeling is as I'm doing this, I'm kind of twisting this foot in a different manner so that my knees go this way instead of straightening this way because you can see how that blocks me. >> Right? So, again, we didn't give this golfer any specific drills. We just had him do it those motions with feedback. So, I'm going to kind of move out of Sean's way. The first thing we're going to focus on with Shawn is just getting to the top correctly. So, let's see if you can kind of go normalish top of the swing speed and really get that lead leg in alignment. >> So, just take it to the top and stop. So, it'll be more like that feel. >> Okay, let's do it a couple more times. >> Yeah. And to me, when I do that, right, I'm internally rotating into the trail hip. And I feel like I've got a stretch right here and kind of that hip flexor area instead of being this way. So, it's that that >> Okay, let's do one where we'll use that as a down the line camera. And what I'm going to do with the shaft here is I'm going to get just above his toes, maybe 3 4 inches from his knee, and he's going to do that same movement without hitting the shaft. Good. So, you've really got to make sure the trail hip goes around rather than just letting his lead knee pull his pelvis out cuz that's early thrust. >> Interestingly enough, if you do it right, it's very challenging to hold the top of the swing, which I think is a good sign. >> It's a very good thing >> because if you can hold it up there for a long time and just kind of fall asleep, it means you didn't put any strain >> or stretch in the system. And and it goes back to years ago. I was teaching a junior golfer and uh really good player and I asked him to pose the top of the swing and he's like, "What are you talking about?" Like it just hadn't occurred to him that why would I ever do that? That was just part of his swing. >> And to me I was like, "You know what? That makes a lot of sense." And I I >> I don't mind those drills, but you have to be real careful with them because it takes that stretch shorten out of the system. So be >> do them to kind of get the feel like we're doing here, but then go back to the motion where you complete the swing. Did you feel a difference with me putting the the shaft in front of your knee? >> Yeah, cuz I tend to kick a little too much towards the target, which lets the strain off of this particular part of my body. I almost feel like I want to wind up from my my lead toe all the way to where my hands are like a big rubber band. And that's what I felt when you did that. >> And we'll have another video here soon, another CSI video talking about that allimp important stretch created around the pelvis of that knee. It's a little bit of precursor for that. So once he was able to do that, he was able to get himself in a good position, get that lead leg in a good position, then we just started working on coming coming down with some speed first without the ball and then with the ball. >> Yeah. >> The whole intent being to get that knee on top of the ankle, but keep the hip behind that knee so he can really start to break himself coming down rather than sliding through impact. >> Yeah. And you see a lot of good drivers, you know, they they transition move more there, right? Where the where the hip is still inside the knee instead of >> sliding in front of the ball or even twisting back where it's way behind the lead angle. >> Yep. >> So, I'll just >> let's put yourself in a good top and then we're going to do what you just advised and just continue to throw it through the motion all the way coming down. >> And then finally, my hips will get up under me. Instead of being into this hip already, it's here and then you're punching into that position like you see good drivers of the ball do. >> Okay. I want you to do one where this one where you kind of put the brakes on somewhere down here with some speed. >> Sure. >> And we're going to kind of check him in a snapshot there of your lead leg. >> There we go. This is what we're looking for. Knee over the ankle. Never want to see it really out past the ankle. That's big trouble. You're going to slide through impact. And then the hip right behind that. If you can get yourself in that good a position with some dynamic movement, boom. Then from there, it's just holding on to the golf club. >> Yeah. So there it, you know, we always call it the uppercut. If I'm going to hit somebody up in here, I've I need to go from here to there. And that's the last part of this through the hit, letting this club point back at me. And I feel like that's that last little boost of speed that you see really good drivers employ. >> Those two things right in that sequence gave him 20 more yards of carry on his drive.
