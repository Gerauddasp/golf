[0.24s] without making a swing go from address

[2.08s] to impact.

[2.96s] >> He was kind of like

[4.08s] >> this is what the average tour player

[6.56s] does. Some do it even way more than

[8.16s] this. That is a myth that you have to

[10.32s] create space.

[11.679s] >> This one really freaks people out. So

[13.44s] they don't realize that this

[15.2s] >> anything you've ever heard us talk about

[16.96s] good and bad can be over and underdone.

[19.359s] >> And then told him the club need to be

[21.439s] feeling lower here but higher here.

[23.92s] First draw he'd ever hit in his life.

[25.359s] Everybody knows the great players are

[27.119s] coming up for about 80% of the down

[29.679s] swing

[30.08s] >> and that can be a mind melt for people

[31.92s] too.

[32.32s] >> We were doing a lesson yesterday and the

[35.04s] golfer, you know, we were suiting him up

[36.559s] in gears, he was telling us that he's

[38.079s] been struggling with impact. And this is

[39.84s] quite a common lesson. So, one of the

[42.239s] things we like to do is, okay, well,

[43.76s] show us where you want to be at impact.

[46.32s] Show us your best impact. Like you were

[48.559s] going to be on the cover of Golf Digest.

[50.48s] Yeah.

[50.719s] >> The golfer got in position. We'll have

[52.16s] Sean demonstrate what he was doing. I'll

[53.92s] do it from down the line probably. Yeah.

[56.239s] So, it's more like he was

[57.76s] >> we'll go we always like to start him at

[59.84s] address first.

[60.96s] >> Yeah.

[61.359s] >> And then say without making a swing, go

[63.28s] from address to impact.

[64.72s] >> He was kind of like

[67.439s] kind of like that.

[68.479s] >> Yeah.

[68.88s] >> Lowered his hands and shoved his rear

[70.64s] end back.

[71.2s] >> What makes you want to do that at

[73.04s] impact? He goes, "Well, I'm I'm creating

[74.88s] space with my pelvis. I'm getting my

[76.56s] butt back and then I can get the handle

[78.88s] low."

[79.28s] >> You're like planing the handle or

[80.64s] whatever he said.

[81.36s] >> Okay. Then we put the same image you're

[83.84s] going to see on the screen right now and

[86s] showed him this is what the average tour

[88.88s] player does. Some do it even way more

[90.64s] than this. And it was like a massive

[92.72s] light bulb to him. He goes, "Well, I

[94.4s] thought standing the handle up was bad."

[96.32s] But the handle should be up higher at

[98.56s] impact. And it's going to be that way

[100s] unless you have either a a strange

[102.56s] setup, you know, abnormal setup like Mo

[105.28s] or Bryson or your way out here

[107.84s] >> or you just do something silly with your

[112.32s] equipment.

[113.2s] >> Yeah.

[113.6s] >> To like have no droop, which is almost

[115.36s] impossible because the shaft is going to

[117.28s] bend downward in the swing. So, you have

[120.399s] to be able to compensate for that. And

[122.799s] the body, which is what one of the

[124.32s] things he was trying not to do to get

[126s] everything back, the body is in that

[128.399s] space. That is a myth that you have to

[130.479s] create space from where you were at

[132.959s] address.

[133.52s] >> It it all ties back into this idea that,

[136s] you know, trying to put yourself back. I

[137.68s] mean, I know beginning golfers will come

[139.36s] in here sometimes and they'll think they

[141.599s] need to come back to impact the same

[144.16s] place where they started.

[145.76s] >> No, they're like great exactly where

[147.28s] they started. To his credit, he was

[148.879s] trying to get open and do all that, but

[150.319s] he was trying to go deeper and lower

[152.4s] than what he thought

[153.68s] >> exactly.

[154.319s] >> So, the handle's going to be roughly

[157.68s] four to five in from setup to address.

[161.92s] Now, that also coincides with roughly

[163.92s] how much you move forward.

[166s] >> Set up to impact, you mean?

[166.959s] >> Yeah. Set up to impact, I'm sorry. Yes.

[168.8s] So, if I set up here at impact, my

[171.04s] pelvis is going to be about 4 in

[172.4s] forward. My handle went four inches

[174.16s] forward. Okay. So that's the shaftling

[176.16s] element of this for what the body does.

[178.48s] The next element and he he understood

[180.48s] that he was fine with that. The next

[182.64s] element was the club handle's going to

[185.92s] be about two to three inches sometimes

[188.4s] more closer to the target line.

[191.599s] >> Yeah, this one really freaks people out.

[193.68s] So they don't realize that at impact

[196.319s] because my body motion I'm kind of

[198.48s] rotating extending this the um the

[201.2s] pelvis here to kind of tuck the hips.

[203.28s] the handle's gonna come up some. Now, is

[205.68s] there a point where it's too much? Yeah.

[207.12s] So, absolutely. Every player is playing

[208.959s] inside of a a tight window. That's why

[210.72s] there's not a million ways to do this.

[212.239s] >> Anything you've ever heard us talk

[213.68s] about, good and bad, can be over and

[215.84s] underdone. So,

[217.04s] >> every good player is a tight window.

[219.36s] >> That's no good. Exactly. Right.

[220.64s] >> That's why a That's why it's hard to get

[223.599s] too far outside the norm standard clubs.

[226.48s] Like, you can't go 4 in long, you can't

[228.72s] go 10° upright,

[230.159s] >> right? it just the the implements don't

[232.64s] work as well anymore.

[233.76s] >> The things that we talk about in our

[235.04s] videos are the things that you can do.

[237.599s] Every golfer can have the handle two to

[240.159s] three inches higher than where it was at

[241.84s] address.

[242.319s] >> Yeah. And so this

[243.2s] >> and 4 in more forward, right? None of

[245.519s] this is outlandishly difficult to do.

[248s] >> So I I was helping um a guy the other

[250.959s] day just I'll walk the bay sometimes. I

[253.12s] mean it's our place. I love helping the

[255.04s] members. And I asked him what he was

[256.639s] trying to do. He was trying to keep his

[258.16s] handle lower and he's like, "Yeah, but I

[261.44s] keep my handle lower and I have this

[262.88s] major like scoop and flip." I said,

[264.96s] "Well, if you think about it, the lower

[267.12s] your handle gets as you swing through

[269.68s] here, that's a bunker shot.

[271.36s] >> That's the most passing. So, you're

[273.44s] doing the trying to keep your handle

[275.44s] down

[276.16s] >> is going to be the wor make it worse."

[278.72s] And I looked at his swing and lo behold,

[281.44s] he was so steep that he ended up

[283.36s] standing the handle up. That's a totally

[285.04s] different ball of wax,

[286.32s] >> right? But still, you know, he was

[288.8s] trying to fix the after effects of the

[291.12s] real problem. So, I tried to get him a

[292.479s] little more on plane and then told him

[294.32s] the club need to be feeling lower here

[296.96s] but higher here. First draw he'd ever

[298.8s] hit in his life

[299.84s] >> cuz this unccocking actually squares the

[301.919s] face a little bit. See that?

[303.28s] >> Right. It's exactly right. So, that that

[304.8s] was my next point. The 4 in forward,

[307.039s] four to five inches forward that

[308.72s] everybody wants that shaft lean is only

[311.28s] doable if you get rid of this angle. So,

[314.96s] you can't have that angle and get it

[317.759s] forward or you're really going to have

[319.6s] to start to really lower your body down

[322s] when we know and not just us that

[324.32s] measures this. Everybody knows the great

[326.8s] players are coming up for about 80% of

[330.16s] the downswing.

[330.88s] >> And that can be a mind melt for people

[332.88s] too that the lowest point of the body is

[334.88s] in here. And I'm

[336.08s] >> No, the lowest point of the hands is

[337.68s] there. The body's already lowest point

[339.6s] of the body is usually up in here.

[340.96s] >> Yeah. So, body's coming up. Yeah.

[343.28s] >> Right. club releases. That also helps

[345.759s] let that this angle out,

[347.759s] >> right?

[348.24s] >> Which is different than a lot of y'all

[349.52s] are thinking it's casting, whatever.

[351.039s] It's it's not,

[352.32s] >> right? I can let the the radial out and

[354.88s] still have shaft lean

[356.88s] >> because I still have the

[358s] >> You need to let it out to have

[359.6s] >> you still have some the the the trail

[361.68s] wrist extension hasn't completely come

[363.28s] out yet, but it's swinging to be on its

[365.44s] way out. But the whole idea here that

[368.72s] once we get people to understand, set

[370.88s] them up at a dress and then put them

[372.4s] into impact and say, "Okay, if I made a

[374.639s] little swing, how would that feel?" A

[376.8s] lot of times they might square their

[378s] face and hit a draw for the first time

[379.28s] in their life or just really flush one.

[381.759s] >> Okay? So, this more than anything is a

[385.6s] concept video, right? Because

[387.759s] >> if your concept is to create space, get

[390.8s] your butt farther back, you're going to

[392.639s] struggle with this. If your concept is

[394.24s] to keep the handle low or even lower it

[396.56s] like he was trying to do, you're really

[398.56s] going to struggle with having a tour

[399.84s] like impact.

[400.479s] >> Yeah. And and I'm all for good pelvis

[402.08s] movements, but if you're trying to push

[403.919s] back farther, that is not what the best

[406.16s] players do.

[407.199s] >> No. Because the pelvis is like, let's

[409.199s] say this is my right hip, this is my

[410.96s] left hip. Okay? So, if I move my pelvis

[413.68s] without any movement towards the target,

[416.4s] which is what everybody tries to avoid,

[418.8s] and just turn on a tilt, right? Mhm.

[421.68s] >> My right side gets closer to the ball

[423.84s] than my left side.

[424.8s] >> Yeah. You can see how it

[425.919s] >> perfectly what the best players in the

[427.199s] world do.

[427.599s] >> And the left one just goes back a

[428.88s] corresponding amount. Right

[430.24s] >> now, if your idea is to move everything

[433.36s] back and not let your right move towards

[435.52s] the ball, you're ain't going to be in a

[436.96s] world of hurt.

[437.44s] >> Look what it does. It's that motion. Now

[439.84s] I have to have this kind of look. And it

[441.84s] just puts you in a contorted position

[443.44s] that you're making it harder than it

[444.88s] needs to be. Trust us on this.

[446.16s] >> You're putting your body in places that

[447.599s] your body's probably not going to enjoy.

[449.36s] >> Exactly. It's not what the best players

[450.639s] in the world do. It doesn't have to be

[452.16s] what you do either. And it's physically

[453.84s] easier not trying to do that. Cuz when

[455.919s] we showed him how to change those

[458.16s] concepts, he's like, "Oh, this is way

[460.319s] easier."

[461.36s] >> A light bulb goes off. Easier on the

[463.44s] body. It's more of a natural releasing

[466.16s] motion, too. So, the club face square is

[468.16s] easier. Hit the ball more in the center

[470s] of the face. You know, that's always

[471.44s] >> Is there a drill for this?

[473.44s] >> No. No. You know, not really. It's just

[475.199s] nice. So many things in the golf swing

[476.879s] are just trying not to do the wrong

[478.639s] things or trying to do the right things.

[481.12s] >> The drill is probably at home setting up

[483.199s] at a dress and then just kind of like

[485.84s] posing like allowing the handle to come

[488.4s] up, hips turned, the rear end tucking

[491.12s] under a little bit, the belt rising a

[492.72s] little and just kind of mimicking that.

[494.72s] And you could even like I did, you could

[496.08s] just chip an easy one from there. Just

[497.759s] pose it and then just kind of back and

[499.28s] just chip it and see what that feels

[501.44s] like. And then, you know, now coming

[503.12s] down, I'm letting this radial out at the

[505.68s] right time as I straighten my lead side

[507.199s] up and I get that nice look where the

[508.96s] club's out in front of me through the

[510.24s] hit.

[510.96s] >> Dana Dalquist has one of my favorite

[513.519s] quotes ever in the golf swing. Best

[515.519s] drill is just to do it right.

[517.519s] >> Yeah.

[518.08s] >> And like you said, go to address.

[520.88s] This hip goes back three inches. Let

[522.8s] this one come forward three inches.

[524.959s] >> And that you're going to see without I'm

[526.8s] not trying to lift my arms. I'm just

[528.88s] trying to move forward and rotate. The

[530.959s] handle comes up. That's it.

[533.76s] >> Yeah. When you rotate, you know, the the

[535.76s] left hip gets a little higher, the

[537.04s] shoulder gets up and around. That raises

[538.88s] the handle a little bit. It's like Mike

[540.48s] said, you're not just trying to go like

[541.76s] this. You're doing you're making the

[543.92s] body movements. If I just pull my hands

[546.24s] like this, have no control over the the

[548.88s] raising or lowering. I just leave my

[550.32s] hands there. You can see the body

[552.64s] movements get the handle up and forward

[554.8s] a little bit. So, you have to really try

[556.72s] to make not good movements to get this

[560.72s] wrong. So, put yourself in that

[562.32s] position. Get your mind and your body on

[564.24s] the same page. Change your concepts if

[566.56s] you need to. You'll start to hit it

[568.16s] better.
