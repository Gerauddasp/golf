We get a lot of questions through emails actually and DMs asking us how the trail knee moves in the swing. Let's kind of tackle this question first with what happens in the down swing. This is going to help you understand what needs to happen in the back swing, which is typically where we see trail knee movement start to go off the rails in the back swing. Downswing wise, what do we want to have happen with that trail knee?

>> Yeah. So, as you're starting to make your down swing, this this trail leg is going to be bending, flexing. Yep. And kind of this whole upper leg is going to be rotating.

>> Yep.

>> Um to the point where about halfway down here before your hands get to your waist, if you're looking at a down the line camera, they they'll be pretty much lined up uh square again.

>> Right. That's where we say, you know, let's say you're square at address, which no button really is, but close enough.

>> You got to resquare them very early in the down swing.

>> Yeah. And then as they continue along, this leg, the trail knee will move outward almost to a point where it almost is getting in line with your toes here. does that kind of around motion with that leg, which oh by the way, when that moves like that, it brings the trail hip around and a lot of good things happen from that.

>> So my simple brain hears you saying the trail knee bends in the down swing as the lead knee straightens.

>> We call it the switch, right? Yep. The knee switch. So lead leg more bent than the trail

>> in the back swing.

>> Yeah. The trail leg is not locked and then they switch. So, as this one starts to straighten and my trail leg starts to bend and move around in a in a line that's kind of a 45 out to the target line,

>> right?

>> As it does that at impact, it'll take on, you know, approximately 3 to one.

>> Typically, see 2:1 to 3:1 depending on the player.

>> The kiss of death would be locking the trail leg back,

>> right?

>> Bracing it off this way or kicking it outside the toe line. So, again, we're playing golf in these windows and that's a big one. So, if we know that trail knee needs to bend in the down swing, if we want to consider the back swing, what we need to do now, it's going to bend in the back swing. It makes no sense to straighten this trail leg in the back swing because the the things that we see amateur golfers do, handicapped golfers do all the time that ruins their down swing is they'll overturn the hip

>> and they lock the trail knee back. It helps to overturn the hip and or shove the pelvis forward in the back swing. Both of those are killers for good down swings.

>> Yeah. Because you only have 02 seconds in the down swing to get all these things in place for a good impact. So if your swing thought is to straighten the trail leg, a lot of times when people are taught that, they'll lock it back. in this kneecap. And we can measure it on 3D. How far the outside dot of my kneecap travels is a huge indicator of where it's going to end up when we're in that kind of halfway down hitters position, the delivery position. Because if it's too far back, there's no time to get it out of there. You end up overly square at impact with the lower body and you can't get the knee action that you see these great players have. You just can't do it. So the average that you'll see on tour with regards to trail knee bend in the back swing is to gain six degrees from address to the top of the swing.

>> Okay.

>> Okay. So good players are bending their trail knee. They're not straightening it. The problem is so this is where looking at video and taking still images of players at the top saying well he straightened his leg gets leads so many people down the wrong road. That's why you want to rely on 3D. And anyone who uses 3D should be able to tell you this trail knee bends. Now, if they're telling you it straightens, then you got to ask yourself, okay, why are they saying the opposite of what the data shows? Now, that doesn't mean at address I just start bending my knee. There's movement to this. There's a there's a pattern of movement. The same thing with wrist angles. You can't wave.

>> You can't just go wrist angle at address, wrist angle at the top, and go there, right? There's a wave to this motion. So,

>> which makes it athletic, by the way. Let's let's let's walk you through that. So, let's have you set up to that ball. So, one of the first things all good players do is have a slight shift away from the target in the back swing.

>> Yeah. So, is you know, a lot of them will even have a little trigger left. Yep.

>> So, they have a little bit of we call it stepping on the right foot and then they start.

>> Okay. So, when you do that, when you shift to the away from the target to start the swing like you see all these great players do, you're going to increase the knee flex right off the bat. You're kind of just kind of bracing that off a little bit. See, don't go

>> this way too far,

>> right? It would be weird to shift off and straighten this knee.

>> Yes.

>> Right. Because you start to get this reverse pivoting. Okay. As you recover from that initial shift off, the knee will kind of start to lose a little bit of flex back to close to where it started. Okay. So the it starts one flex, adds flex, starts to lose a little flex, and then as you start to get to the top and that down swing sequence starts to unwind, you're going to be putting in or should be putting in knee flex again by the time you reach the top in preparation for that quarter of a second down swing.

>> It's that kind of wave. So wherever you are to dress, little shift off the ball. You can see it like a macroy, right? Little shift off the ball.

>> Might gain a little there to brace. losing a little here as this club gets above uh the shoulder, start gaining a little bit in preparation for the the unwinding and you're actually lightening your body a little bit right there. That's a whole another discussion for these force plates,

>> right?

>> But that's the the action of the the knee and we got it in gears. So, we're not really making this stuff. It's one thing to say you're not right. It's another thing to say we're making it up. We're not making it up

>> or we're interpreting it wrong, which is

>> anybody that has gears can look at that.

>> Yes. So the cool part is you don't have to think about starting with a flex, bending in a little bit, straightening a little. No one we've ever taught has to think about that. The hurdle to get over is if you're a straighten the trail knee guy. That's what you have to get out of. If I just shift over, my body's going to athletically respond to that. Am I get a little recenter? It's going to add a little more flex. The issue you want to get out of your mind is straightening this knee to turn my hips. I can turn my hips a ton if I straighten this knee. That's going to throw my pelvis forward, give me either a reverse pivot or one of these kind of old school pivots like how I was taught. Now I've got issues coming way too far inside in the down swing or coming over the top if I do the reverse pivot.

>> The issue with it is you see the players that do that, they're straightening the trail leg when the good players are bending the trail leg. That's right. And when I start to see, you know, there's there's one thing and you could say, well, there's a whole lot of different ways to play golf. And there there is. Well, you can go to the driving range and see a whole lot of different ways,

>> you know, but there's certain things that the good players do that they really all get lumped together. And you don't see many players straightening the trail knee to start the down swing.

>> You just don't see it.

>> It's like you take you think of golf the golf swing mechanics as a pyramid, right? The base of the pyramid pyramid is the widest. That's where all golfers fall. So, you've got terrible golf swings, great golf swings. You got, I don't know, a thousand different ways to swing a club. As you start going up into skill, you start shedding all of these things that don't really quite work. When you get to the very top, you start to see so many people doing the same things regardless of what it looks like. That's why we don't rely on looks. We rely on measured data.

>> Yeah. You might see some stylistic stuff with the club, but you're looking at like big, like we call them big dials of the body get lumped together. They get lumped together pretty tight.

>> And if you interpret 26° of knee bend as being more than 20 degrees of knee bend, you're interpreting 3D data correctly. It's it's pretty simple. We we learned how to do that in the second grade. I think

>> this is one of those things, too. When I when I first got gears, I started you just kind of put it on yourself,

>> right? And you when I first got I probably used it for a month too before I even put it on a student because I just feel like you need to figure out how to do this and figure out what the numbers mean compared to what you're doing. And this was one of the ones that stood out to me. I'm like, why is my knee going the opposite way of all the good players?

>> You have the opposite graph, inverted graph.

>> That was one of the things that jumped out at me is like, okay, you probably don't want to do something that's completely opposite than what good players are doing. And this is the one that helped me a lot actually. It got my It stopped me from overturning because if I straighten late, it was a big backend overturn.

>> Yeah, you were you were imbalanced. You had more way more back swing rotation than open at impact

>> and that's a way to do that. Golfers are under the false impression. If I can just turn more, I can swing faster.

>> Well, you're going to have a problem because you're going to get back around square at impact and that's not good.

>> Yeah. So, I it allows me not to overturn, allows me to start my hip sequence a little sooner, which gets the the sequence and the stretch happening correctly. I can get more open with my body and a lot of good things happen just from that. So, don't discount this one. Um, it can be a real game changer.

>> And a great way to work on this is to train the down swing because if you know the knee is going to bend in the down swing and the the right knee, your trail knee has to get involved in the down swing, you're not going to be wanting to lock it in the back swing.

>> 100%. And if you do lock it, there's there's just not enough time to to get it into this position here where you've got the trail knee kicked in a little farther than where the lead knee starts going back. That's what gets you the the proper tilts and turns to the lower body and that that domino kind of cascades up through so you can deliver the club correctly.

>> So, I'm going to get out of the way and we're going to have Shawn go to lead arm parallel on his back swing.

>> Okay.

>> Just a little shift off the ball, lead arm parallel. Okay. You're going to give it a small little pump and you're going to focus on that trail knee gaining some flex as you transition into the down swing and just chip one out there.

>> Yeah. So, I've got just feeling kind of bouncy on this leg. Not locked, not super bent. Right.

>> So, I'm going to finish that right there.

>> Now, you get used to transitioning like this. Your swing to transition is going to start to accommodate the transition.

>> It's a great drill. More of a sequencing drill. That's exactly right. You know, once you've got the positions of the swing kind of sorted, it's like if you learn to play a piano, you know, you learn the right hand, the left hand. At some point, you got to put the dynamics in there of the rhythm and the timing of the song and how hard you hit the the keys.

>> And this part of it is you you learn the positions. Now, you got to sequence the the thing correctly, which tends to allow the club to be more square at impact and longer and straighter.

>> So, film yourself. Use the Swing Coach app. Use your camera on your phone. Make sure you see some flex being put in in that later part of the back swing so you can really start to add it in the down swing.
