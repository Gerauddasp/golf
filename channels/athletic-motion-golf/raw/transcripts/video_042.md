[0:00] This really popular golf drill is dangerous if done for the wrong reasons.

[0:03] I can tell you how many years I spent doing this drill.

[0:06] Yeah. So again, I don't mind it with little wedge shots. Actually can help. You really disconnected and you're not pivoting. But the problem lies when you start adding this to a full swing.

[0:16] Yes,

[0:17] you can't elevate your your trail arm enough to get it to where it needs to be.

[0:21] I was taught to have it kind of right where you've got it. Kind of right mid to higher mid bicep.

[0:26] And again, I don't mind it for these little half shots. It marries up your arm and uh swing and body turn. But if I try to make a full back swing like this, it's difficult to get the arms high enough to where they need to be at the top of the swing. So you're going to abbreviate your back swing, it's also going to get it to where it's kind of deep. And then the first move that for that golfer usually because the arm angle is so low and they turn, it sends the hand path out. So they have to do all uh they had to add a few other moves in to be playable at that
