[0:00] If you're going to do a takeaway drill,

[1.68] get the lead shoulder going across. You

[3.44] know, don't just stick the club there.

[4.64] We know that doesn't work. The body has

[6.16] to pivot. So, lead shoulder across and

[8.72] you're just kind of shaking hands with

[10.32] the left hand and putting your other

[11.52] hand on. And as you bend over a little

[13.04] bit like a golf swing, that face will

[14.80] tip down just slightly and you'll be in

[16.88] a good spot. Now, you've got the weight

[18.96] of the club kind of in line with the arm

[21.36] and and you've got the club on the back

[23.44] swing track. So, you've gone from

[25.60] address to getting it up on this back

[27.36] swing track. Now I can go up and down

[29.04] that track and the club motion will move

[32.56] along with my hands.

[33.92] >> Right.

[34.48] >> Where the other way the club motion is

[36.48] going this one direction, the hand path

[38.56] is another direction and they scissor

[40.16] the other way.

[40.72] >> They're always kind of flopping back and

[42.24] forth.

[42.56] >> Yeah. You don't get this kind of uniform

[44.32] lowering of the hands and lowering of

[45.92] the club head at a very similar rate,

[47.92] which is a good thing to do as far as

[49.60] consistency.
