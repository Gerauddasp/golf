kind of demonstrate the popular motion of what early extension is. I will challenge you if you think you're an early extender or have worked on early extension to not think of it as early extension anymore. You are early thrusting in gears. Thrust is just measuring something moving away or towards the target line. Early thrust is a back swing issue. Golfers will kind of keep this butt on the tush line, but this femur goes out. It's when they lift the left heel and this whole femur hip joint stays high and swings out. >> A lot of golfers come in for a lot of reasons to take lessons. One of the most popular ones is they have been told they early extent. Now Sean does a down the line view for this camera here kind of demonstrate the popular motion of what early extension is. They'd be like they think about an impact that they're they've moved the center of their hips, >> body kind of stands up, hips move forward. >> Yeah. Early they they're doing it too soon. >> It's a terrible term. So, I will challenge you if you think you're an early extender or have worked on early extension to not think of it as early extension anymore. The body starts extending as soon as the club moves in the best swings. You are early thrusting. in gears. Thrust is just measuring something moving away or towards the target line, >> the ball basically. >> So that would be thrust. That would be negative thrust. You are early thrusting. If you see yourself early extending, the reason we don't like the early extension term is because golfers feel the solution for that is to bend over more, which does not happen in high level players. Well, especially down by the ball, they do both hips >> right >> to both hip joints backwards through the ball. And that's one of the things we feel like is a super kiss of death and a death move. >> One of the reasons why it's a death move is that's a down swing correction for a back swing problem. Early thrust, I would say 99 I can't think of an instance where it hasn't been, but I'll say 99.99% of the time is a back swing issue. >> Yeah. Yeah, >> but because we're used to filming it from down the line, drawing a line on the butt, no one sees it until the down swing. But that horse is already out of the barn. So, you're not going to fix a back swing issue in the down swing very successfully. >> Most of the time it's it's getting out of position and not understanding how the body moves into the back swing. So, if you can kind of load it load the system up correctly, >> correct? >> It's it's um not as easy to early thrust, >> right? So, I want you to think if you're an early thruster, I want you to think of this lead femur, what it does in the back swing. >> Mhm. >> So, so often, try to do this from down the line, golfers will kind of keep this butt on the tush line, but this femur goes out. Now, that has pulled my pelvis. I've really thrusted about 3 in there. I've got no chance of keeping this butt or either hip on the line when I start the down swing. So, this is my gripe with just telling people just blanketly to lift their left heel and oh, it's okay to lift your left heel. It is okay to lift your left heel, but what most golfers do when they lift the left heel instead of just I can tap this foot up and down. It's when they lift the left heel and this whole femur hip joint stays high and swings out is the main problem. >> Yeah, that's one. Just overbending the knee. But doing that >> that throws my pelvis out. >> And lifting the heel is the one that I see the most because it keeps the trail hip high and lead hip high too. So you can't you can't get this angle of the pelvis that you're looking for. So you can play downhill. So if you're lifting it, that's one thing, but make sure you're not lifting it and swinging this thing open like a barn door this way. >> Yeah. So a great way to think about this in the back swing is my lead femur, my left femur is going to move out some. I've got to make sure my right hip counterbalances that in equal amounts. >> Makes sense. >> Three forward, three back. Now I've turned around the center of my pelvis. And I haven't early thrusted. Got every opportunity now in the down swing not to do it. When this one swings out, we've seen it go out as much as 9 in to zero in. It doesn't matter who you are. You are going to hump into the golf ball. >> Well, you're changing your pivot point. You're going boom. Now, this is your pivot point. Yes. To meet. And if you're doing that, it's almost an automatic motion, right? It's like cooked in. >> And if you want to find out if this is an issue with your swing, let's have Sean set up to this. Um, well, actually, like you're hitting a ball to this camera here, Sean. >> So, kind of a target view. Now, I'm going to put my club grip here, right on the center of his knee joint. So, he's going to make a back swing. Now, he's going to stop with the club just above his hands coming down. He's got to have this knee joint back to at least where it started, if not farther behind it if he wants to make sure his pelvis moves correctly. >> Yeah. So, I mean, that's such a good key, right? >> Been tracking a lot of knee joints lately. >> So, we can have the ability to track where this is, this dot on gear, this sensor is in space, and you start to see patterns with good players, and like you said, they all get it back >> to where it started. >> I can see if I did it wrong. Now, if you don't you didn't the pelvis has got nowhere to go but to the golf ball cuz you're always going to hit the ball. >> Yeah. So, I mean, even when you're playing, you could imagine a dot there and say, "I don't want to move too far away from that." >> Yep. >> Cuz I've got too far to go back. So, you know, you're playing in these tight windows. And we don't preach one golf swing, but we do preach that there's windows of good solid movements. >> All right. And we can also, so that's one way to gauge one if you have early thrust and how to work on it. Just think of how much that knee travels. And if you travel it way out and you can't get it back, you got to start curtailing how much it moves out. All right. So, the next thing you can do is put a kind of a depth gauge in front of your body. So, I'm going to have Sean set up to this. I'm just going to put our plane board. You can again, you can use a box or anything butted right up against her toes. Let's actually do this from down the line. >> Buted right up. He's going to put his toes right up to it. So, his goal now is in his back swing is not let his knee go past his toes. >> Yeah, this is a good one. I mean, you could use a a little box or something. >> Absolutely. Yeah. Um >> I use at home I'll use a a foam roller, one of those 24in foam rollers. Same thing. >> Yeah, it's good. It just gives you a space to play inside of. And you can use it for both knees. So, as I go to the top, this knee is going to bend naturally and it will just get up to the point. You don't need to stay away from it because that's unnatural. Let it let your knee bend to get up to it. And as you do that, >> you'll gain a little more space here. Not from necessarily the leg straightening a lot, but it's the like Mike said, the >> if you had the sensor on the gear suit, which is right here on my hip, is that as that goes back, it pulls the whole femur back some. >> Exactly. So, I see a lot of golfers are trying to keep the leg from straightening too much, which I don't mind, but they do it by they don't let any space happen here, and it's an awkward kind of contrived. >> I can keep the same knee bend and it actually turns away from it. As long as you turn into that leg, >> that's what we want. Yes. And it's always the devil's in the details. So, it's like, okay. And and when when people say, "Oh, the leg's definitely straightening." A lot of that, and you figured this out a long time ago, is the turning motion that makes it look like it's straightening more than it is. >> Is again, you're moving away from that camera, which as soon as you do that, it looks like the joint straightening. >> And part of it, too, when that turns and this femur backs away from this plane board because of the hip joint, not my knee snapping straight, that also looks like you're straighten your leg. So, the things you're seeing, you have to be real careful looking at video because you can interpret why it looks that way. Wrong. Right. >> And get some bad motion in your swing. So anyways, don't do this. >> Yes. The key here is to not bang it with your left. Yeah. >> In the back swing and then not bang it with your right in the down swing. >> Now look, that doesn't mean this. >> No, it's the opposite of that. >> That means just get the leg there so it just grazes it. And then you'll have both knees a little bit away from it halfway down. >> And the same thing. I'm not snap. I think we're seeing a lot of people now snapping this knee, trying to >> trying to get ground force. >> You, all you're trying to do is let this lead side start to extend and allow the trail leg to come to the board. Now, >> and that gets me the ideal center of the pelvis motion. >> That's exactly right. We're trying to control the depth again, the thrust of the center of the pelvis. We're not trying to restrict both ends from moving forwards and backwards. That's that's normal. We're trying to restrict the middle part of the pelvis from going forward. It >> it changes your your thought process about what you're trying to do. And that's important when you're trying to make a swing change. I know as soon as I started thinking about where the middle of my pelvis is moving, that's a lot different than each individual hip joint, >> right? And just like, you know, the the wheel on your tire, you have to let the outside rotate for the center to stay put. So, think of it that way. Use these two drills. You'll start to see what used to be called early extension, which is now the proper term, early thrust, disappear from your swing.
