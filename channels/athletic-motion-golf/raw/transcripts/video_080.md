Most often it's what's happening in the back swing that is forcing you to cast in the down swing. You may be guilty of this as well. You're trying to hold these angles to not cast. >> Instead of keeping some width with their arms away from their head, basically they end up kind of dropping this trail arm low and behind them, right? And then watch what that does to the wrist. >> In the back swing, the arm should be working up. This is normally what you going to see with the best player. This arm is working up. the club's pivoting on plane versus this. One of the most common issues that you tell us you have is casting in the down swing. And if you've ever been to the local driving range or if you've ever filmed your swing, there's a good chance you might see these angles being let go and that club head getting really far away from you very early in the down swing. What we see when golfers come in in our golf schools or our lessons is they're trying to fix that on the down swing. So, when you see the wrist move away, you may be guilty of this as well. You're trying to hold these angles to not cast, most often it's what's happening in the back swing that is forcing you to cast in the down swing just to have a chance. So, let's talk about this trail arm movement that's so often the culprit for the cast. That happens way earlier than what we see a cast. >> Yeah. And then, you know, first things first, you know, make sure the grip is in the right place in your hand. Don't grip it in the palm because the pal a palm grip in your lead hand tends to cast even worse because you can't accept the club. So, let's just start there. Now, the the piece that causes the most problem in the back swing is as the golfer starts swinging up to the top here, instead of keeping some width with their arms away from their head basically, right? Or their trail shoulder, hands away from the trail shoulder, they end up kind of dropping this trail arm low and behind them, right? And then watch what that does to the wrist. So, it's like this onetoone relationship. As soon as I do that, trying to get a bigger back swing, it unccks and they start to see that club tumble out of the top and they're not able to hang on to this angle. So, to me, a lot of it starts right in the back swing. >> Yeah. And Sean's exaggerating that for visual effect to make it easy to see. But what it's doing is, and we see this all the time when we have golfers in gears, and we'll put some of those images on the screen, is we all start with the arm extended at address, right? Lifted up. It's not we don't start at address like this. So the arm's lifted to start. You just think from the elbow to the shoulder in the back swing. The arm should be working up. If you're a caster, there's a big chance that you're doing this in the back swing, which again makes you lose those angles and you get that start of a down swing where the angles are already being let out and they're going to continue to be let out faster when the down swing starts. as he takes the the arm up to the top here. What he's saying is even though it doesn't look like it's lowering maybe on camera, as it goes behind you, it's physically lowering to the torso, right? >> Yeah. So, >> explain that to us. >> If you just bend over kind of normal golf posture, and I'll kind of use this camera here as my down the line, my arm is is lifted off my center line. Okay. So, if I just stood straight up, it would be like this. >> Yeah. So, this is what people don't realize. >> This would be normal. This is no arm lift. But when I get in golf posture, my arms hang. So there's some arm torso >> roughly around 40 45° for just about everybody. >> Beautiful. >> Now what happens in the back swing >> right in the takeaway >> the arm starts to work up or it should start to work up. You see that with the best players in the world. What we see with most amateurs is in the back swing the arm will start to work down. >> And it's such a >> exact opposite. Well, it's a mind melt because you're turning. So, the everything's kind of going up, but you got to think about what's the arm segment to the torso segment doing, not just visually. Exactly. Right. >> Not just the global view of it. >> Relative to your center line, not the ground. >> Exactly. >> Right. I think thinking of it relative to the ground or my club's getting up, how can my arm be lowering? >> This is where this is where the confusion. >> This is how that looks in the golf swing to lower your arm. This is normally what you going to see with the best players. This arm is working up. The club's pivoting on plane versus this. So, I've lowered my arm right away. I've got rid of those 45 degrees right away. And you are cooked when that happens. >> And a lot of times because of that, they'll start tilt. You know, they'll use the frontal plane here. >> All sorts of stuff. >> So, they're like, how could it be lower? And the club and the hands are going up. But you got to remember it's the arm segment to the torso segment, not just where this club is in space. And that's why I love this point of uh for the player >> for the player perspective. Yes, >> the for the player perspective, it's like what is one segment doing related to the other segment, just like we've shown with the arm lowering. >> Um, same idea. So, >> yeah, we want you to think about the swing relative to you. >> Exactly. >> Your arm relative to your torso, not your arm relative to a stationary camera or the ground. It's got to be relative to you. I think when we understand and think about the swing, okay, what am I doing? regardless of what it looks like because that's going to depend on where these cameras are located. And the cameras aren't going to move. So, you've got to know where to put things relative to your body. That's the only thing that matters. >> Exactly. And I think that's probably the one thing that we've used to help more to help people more than anything else. Getting them to understand what's this segment doing to this segment, not just overall in the swing, especially the arm lowering. And this ties into it, right? This lowering behind. So whether it's Ben Hogan on up Samne on up to the current day players, everyone lifts the trail arm and the lead arm in the back swing. It's not just >> arm bend that gets it to the top. It's up arm lift. Now it can be overdone, right? Anything can be over or underdone. >> Exactly. >> You cannot lower the arms in the back swing >> and expect to have good wrist angles because it's going to throw it out of the way. The drill we like to do for this, this is a great drill. It's got a lot of kind of pass or fail elements to it. >> Yeah. >> So Sean's going to do and you What was the old training aid called? >> Kalassi swing mag. >> Swing magic. It had a lot of good benefits in that. >> That I had one of those. I had one of those back in the day. I was probably 12 years old and it had a >> it had a a handle on it that was kind of molded like your right hand grip and it would slide. It was actually pretty darn good training a >> um I ended up getting the case the snap hooks with it, but I don't think I was using it right. So, but >> 12-year-old Sean didn't know what to do. >> I was hooking it everywhere. So, uh, my dad made me put it away, but but this drill will help with this particular issue. So, what you're going to do is grab the club shoulder width. You're going to get in your dress position like this. And you're going to keep your arms fairly straight. So, it's going to feel different if you're used to using your arms to get the club up. You're going to use a torso and a hip turn kind of get the club up there. And when you do it, your right arm will end up being pretty wide because you have the built-in width factor with your hands apart. So, what you're going to do, you're going to swing it up there, and then as a club gets to the top, you're going to slide your hands together. The trick is as you get up here, you a lot of you that are guilty of lowering the arm, you'll kind of you'll feel like your hands going to come off because you're not used to where this club and uh arms are compared to your torso. So, it's boom, slide, swing. So, it's one, slide down, swing. And when you do it right on the face on camera, you'll see some space between my head and my hands. And you can see as soon as I over retract or pull this trail arm behind me, my from the face on, my hands get behind my head here. So, >> face that camera there. >> Yeah. >> So, what what you just mentioned there is an old Butch Harmon swing queue, and it's it still applies if you have a circle around your head. So set up to it with the with the separate hands there like you >> so put a circle around Sean's head and as he goes to the top he wants to keep his hands out of his head circle. >> Yeah. See I have some u air here between my head and my hands. If I overpull this right arm behind me you can see how there's no space there anymore. >> Now that's for most normal humans rotationally. Obviously if you kept rotating and rotating and rotating the hands would eventually be back here. But for normal amount of rotation, 90° of shoulder rotation, they're going to stay out of the out of the two circles. >> Or like a lot of juniors are hyperflexible in their shoulder joints and don't really have a builtup chest. >> So, you know, you're going to get a lot more reduction of the lead arm. So, you might, but like for most players in general, this is a good drill just to monitor that anyway. Most players get the hands in the head circle by >> doing that >> lowering the arm and just pull it in which unccocks it. So, one of the cool benefits of this drill, if you'll go to the actually go to the top and try to lower your right arm >> with the drill. >> Yeah, with the drill. >> Yes. >> It's just impossible to do. Why we like this? >> Terrible. So, you're really feeling like you're almost pushing away, >> right? >> So, I feel like as I'm I'm pushing outward. That's another Butch Harmon, you know, feeling of pushing the wall. um as I get to the top and then just slide my hand down and that gives us that full turn shortish arm swing that works happens to work really good. We always say if you're going to build a golfer kind of from scratch in a lab >> big turn short arm swing. >> Yeah. Cuz the arms kind of will come with you instead of getting trapped and some of the problems you see with getting stuck is just the arms get ran off too far. Arms pull behind and now I'm I'm stuck. >> Yeah. >> On the down swing. If you know that you cast or if you think you cast, you just can't get any shaft lean, rewind it back a little bit and look at what that trail arm is doing in the back swing. Chances are you're lowering it at some point in the back swing. You may be lowering it right in the takeaway or, you know, to try to get a bigger turn without actually turning by just pulling the club farther behind you. Either one of those will be fixed with this drill. >> Yeah. And what you can do even I got a foam ball here. I'm just going to like chip one here so I don't kill you. Stand right there. So, you can do it once you get used to it. You can buy these foam balls on our website. Set up normal. Take it here up. Slide the hand down. Nice little chip. And if you do that from the face on camera, just the act of that sliding as you're unwinding, a lot of you are going to see this club down in here deeper for the first time without being completely lined up with your lead arm >> because your arms are going to be working better. >> Exactly. This is a really good one to practice at home with a foam ball into a net. Film it. Film kind of a fun exercise. Film your before swing and then film it with this drill with a foam ball and then come back on and let us know how it went in the comments because I think you're going to find you're getting the club in a much better spot here so the release happens later. >> Yep. And if you need and this drill is all about getting rid of the cast is all about giving you more compression ultimately. >> Yeah.
