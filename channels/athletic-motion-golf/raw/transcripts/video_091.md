A lot of you have downloaded the Swing Coach app and a lot of you have sent in comments telling us how much you're enjoying it and we're golfers. We're the same way. I think it's the best training app that I've ever seen for certainly practicing the swing.

>> Yeah.

>> The founder of Swing Coach Brisco sent us a text on Monday kind of listing out or asked us first what we thought were the top issues that all of you have been using that faced. And we did not get number one correct. Number one was actually where your hands are at the top of your swing. How much depth are you? Are you up here? Are you way back here? Or are you right in the zone? And the number one issue with all of you guys and gals who've been using the app so far, the feedback is hands too deep, too far back.

>> Too far back is the feedback. So the butt of the club somehow one way or the other, right? Getting too far behind you uh at the top of the back swing. Depth is essential for a good golf swing, right? Allows you to shallow the club, allows you to turn better, all those sorts of things. But how you go after that depth really makes or breaks whether that's a swing fault or just fitting your body dimensions.

>> The trend is to deep, get deep, get your hands as deep as you can. And a lot of us that try to do that will have to do that at the expense of our body angles, right? Okay. And I think that's what you're seeing inside the Swing Coach app is, you know, someone here trying to get their hands in a certain spot and they have to stand up basically to get them there.

>> I've heard it a lot in lessons like, "So, what are you working on?" You know, when players come in and see us, I'm trying to get more depth. I like how Rory gets depth in a swing. What you don't understand a lot of times is that a player like Rory has around 130 degrees of shoulder rotation. That's way more than most humans can do.

>> Exactly. So, if let's say my shoulder rotation tops off at 70, right? So, if you're an older golfer losing flexibility, you may only have about 70 degrees of shoulder rotation. Okay? So, my depth is going to be right there. Now, if I'm trying to get Rory depth, I've got to come out of my posture just to put myself back there. And any benefit you get from depth, just go straight out the window.

>> The moral of the story here is everyone's going to have a depth that's right for their body, right? And if you just have basically 90 degree turn caught average, you know, the hand depth doesn't need to be really as deep as everybody thinks. As long as you're somewhere between what midfoot and heel, you're going to be in that good swing

>> for most golfers. So if you'll if you'll set up down the line here. Yeah. And if you take a good setup, and I'm just going to put my shaft as vertical as I can make it there. It's about middle of Sea's grip there where his hands meet on the club.

>> It's just a couple inches in front of his toes.

>> Okay. So his hand and you can just look at the right hand is going to go from just in front of his toes to about where the his ankle is.

>> Boom.

>> To get that amount of depth, which is again a normal amount of depth, he was able to keep in his angles turned all the things we want. Now if I say, "Okay, Sean or Sean's idea is to go back to that starting point. Let's get your hands back here like a player like Rory would be just because he has so much more turn.

>> You can see what I have to do. Now, you've really got to tax what you're doing and come out of all those good angles that you created on the first version. So, how you create depth is in most cases more important than how much depth you have. It's got to be a minimum amount, but we see golfers chasing it way past that minimum.

>> Yeah, we've showed this a bunch, but you know, the arms, they end up going up and down, right? If I go up here and then just make my body turn to about 90 with the shoulders,

>> I'll have some space under this arm. That'll put you in the zone on the Swing Code foot. You'll get the good swing feedback. You don't have to be a mile behind your heels here to get in that zone to play good golf.

>> That's exactly right. So, when you're using the Swing Coach app, and if you don't have it, click the link down below. We'll we've got like a twoe free trial, I think it is, right? To no harm to try it out.

>> Got to be on an Apple device coming in Android soon, but right now it's only Apple. Try it out. put hand path at the top and then put spine at the top. Spine angle at the top. And if you can get your hands if you have the the physical ability to get your hands a little deeper and your spine stays good, that may just fit your body dimensions.

>> Exactly.

>> But if you can get your hands deeper and you lose your spine angle, that's where the issues at.

>> Yeah, that's a good kind of drill to do together in there. And when you use the app, you'll see that you can select a few parameters. And that one happens to be a really good kind of duo. Right.

>> Right. Because so many golfers we see right in lessons will come in get that depth, but I've lost my spine angle. So when I start down, those golfers tend to want to get depth to help them shallow. But if you're shallowing or getting depth by coming out of your posture, you're going to steepen it for that effort. So you really gain nothing or in some cases get worse. But

>> Exactly. And you could see that if I if I start here flatten out, I can't get to the ground this way. Right. So, I have to rebend over and that momentum gets the club flipping out over the plane. You got a whole another set of issues.

>> So, what's a good way to We're going to turn on the spine. We're going to turn on the hand path at the top.

>> What's a good drill golfers can do to train that?

>> One of them is just take the club like this, right? And practice turning kind of inside your spine angle, you would say, right? Obviously, there's some things going on here.

>> Yeah. So, do the setup to it again. Yeah. Yeah. So, we just put a line kind of right down mimicking his in just straight lines like a shaft here, his back and then one down his front. So, his torso is in that box.

>> Yeah.

>> You're trying to just turn in that box. You don't want to come out of the box. You don't want to dip below the box.

>> Exactly. I'm just turning this way. The butt of the club will point outside the ball, not at the ball. And my head will stay pretty still, but my shoulder will go across.

>> That's the mark of a good pivot. You don't need to be think if you just think like that. You don't need to think, okay, I need to side bend and then do you don't need to do all that if you

>> or or you know one of these to get more depth. We see this all the time where again you'll just flatten your shoulders to get your hands way out of range.

>> Exactly. This is a much more simple way to to think about what the pivot does. So that would be kind of step one. Yep.

>> The other thing you could do is once you have that sorted out, just flip the club here up on your shoulder, turn, and then just lift the club up up and away here. So this arm is level to the ground. That's going to be the right amount of depth for your build,

>> right?

>> You know, if I had arms that were 3 ft longer, it's a different story, right?

>> Or really thin shoulders, thin chest, right? Gumby kind of like think like junior golfer build.

>> Yeah.

>> You can get things way behind you without turning much at all, but most adults don't have that option.

>> Yeah. And you might find your spot, you might be a little outside the range, which is fine. You're just trying to avoid kind of the red ranges. That's why pairing those two elements, spine at the top, hands at the top, is a good combination training tool. So, if you've got the spine, it's turning in that box that we just talked about, and your hands are maybe one behind or two behind, but everything else is good, that just may be your best number for your dimensions.

>> You do want to make sure though that you have both of those because if you're getting one at the expense of the other, not going to be good.

>> Exactly. Right. So, if you want another drill to help you to do this, click on another link down there below in that pin comment. We'll give you another free drill. So, one of our favorite Gary Gilkust drills.
