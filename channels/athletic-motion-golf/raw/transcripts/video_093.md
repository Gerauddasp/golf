## Raw Transcript

[0.24s] golfers get really confused around the
[1.76s] greens if they need to hit a low shot or
[4.00s] like a mid- height pitch shot. And those
[5.44s] are two different shots. We call the low
[7.28s] shot a chip or a number one in our short
[9.36s] game system. We call the mid height shot
[11.44s] that spins and stops on the green.
[13.28s] That's our number two. And I would
[14.88s] define that as more of a pitch. And the
[17.60s] key differences are in the setup, but
[19.20s] also in how the club goes away. If you
[21.12s] want to hit a lower shot, the hands are
[22.72s] going to be higher and the face is going
[23.92s] to stay more hooded. If you want the
[25.92s] pitch shot or the number two, you have
[28.16s] to feel like the toe of the club works
[30.16s] up more on the back swing and the club
[32.88s] works a little more around you as
[34.48s] opposed to straight back with a low
[36.00s] shot. So, I'll hit the number two or the
[38.00s] pitch shot here. Let the toe open up a
[40.32s] little bit to present the loft of the
[41.92s] club to the ball. Back and through. Go
[44.00s] ahead and extend the body in the finish.
[45.52s] That ball will pop up mid height with
[48.00s] plenty of spin. Stop close to the hole.
