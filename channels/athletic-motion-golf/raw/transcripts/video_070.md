[0.00s] Here's an easy way to hit a lowflying

[1.76s] chip shot that hits the green and runs

[3.36s] out to the hole. First of all, you're

[4.56s] going to play the ball slightly back in

[5.92s] your stance. You're gonna have your feet

[7.20s] close together about a club width

[8.48s] between your heels. Turn your lead toe

[10.64s] out about 45 degrees. The other big

[13.28s] change here is you're going to have your

[14.80s] ball position only about a foot away.

[17.04s] So, that's going to get your handle

[18.32s] higher. And the good thing about that is

[20.24s] it's going to make the club go back a

[21.68s] little more shut. So, you can keep the

[23.28s] loft off the club as it comes into the

[25.44s] ball. And then the key motion of the

[27.28s] swing here, you're gonna go a little bit

[28.56s] forward on the back swing with your body

[30.72s] and then keep the club head more in line

[32.96s] with your lead arm here on the way

[34.40s] through instead of letting it release

[36.16s] like you would in a number two or a

[37.76s] pitch shot. Kind of a low driving shot

[41.12s] using more of the leading edge. Comes

[43.68s] out low, rolls up to the flag. Do that.

[45.76s] You'll get those shots closer to the

[47.12s] hole.
