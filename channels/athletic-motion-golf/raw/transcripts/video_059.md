[0:00] Even the best players in the world struggle with the simple things. Sunday before the Masters this year, we had Sam Burns come in for a gear session with his team and he wanted to get some answers about his swing and using gears were able to figure out his setup position was getting twisted to the left and open which got his trail forearm carrying a little bit high here.

[0:19] When he did that, his club head started too far outside and would flop laid off causing him to be a little bit steep coming down and not being able to make his normal down swing.

[0:28] So once we got his forearms more in line, got his body a little more square, the club swung back more on plane, it arrived at the top less laid off and then when he started using his body coming down, the club was shallow out and he could turn through and hit a lot better shot.

[0:42] So again, if you're struggling with the early part of the back swing, which affects the rest of the swing, make sure your body's in a good position. Get the hips and the shoulders a little more square and the forearms lined up and you'll be able to start hitting more solid shots.
