[0:00] We were doing a lesson last week and the
[1.68] golfer was struggling to make a change
[4.16] and we were working on something in his
[5.76] back swing and he just couldn't quite
[7.60] get it. What we gave him to do when we
[9.76] know it helped him but it's probably
[10.96] going to be good for you to do as well
[12.88] provided you qualify for certain key
[15.52] parameters. We gave him a pause.
[17.36] >> Yeah.
[18.08] >> And he was just going too fast into the
[20.48] corner and coming out reckless.
[22.64] >> Yeah. He he was a perfect candidate cuz
[24.40] he was slow takeaway fast in the second
[27.12] half of the back swing and then it was
[29.12] going so fast he had to grab that
[30.80] otherwise it would almost bounce off his
[32.56] shoulder. So he grabbed it quick out of
[34.40] the top. So he was missing that where
[36.16] the club kind of comes to that nice
[38.08] smooth transition and unwinding the body
[40.24] and letting the club come down.
[41.60] >> Right. What we were working on was the
[44.56] middle part of his swing which is left
[46.00] arm parallel the back swing lead arm
[48.08] parallel the down swing. And you know,
[50.72] he got it, he could walk himself through
[52.24] it, but as soon as there was a ball down
[53.68] there in front of him, it was slow and
[56.56] to try to hit the ball.
