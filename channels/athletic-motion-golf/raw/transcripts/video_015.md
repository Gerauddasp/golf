[0.08s] What you'll see with the best players in

[1.44s] the world is and it's a little bit of

[2.96s] illusion staying down, right? I I don't

[6.00s] like that description much of this at

[7.60s] all because it's not what happens.

[9.12s] >> It's a terrible description

[11.44s] that you can pile that right next to

[13.12s] early extension. Terrible description of

[14.88s] what happens. So, in the down swing at

[16.80s] around lead arm parallel or even a

[18.80s] couple ticks above lead arm parallel,

[21.12s] the best players in the world are

[22.64s] starting to move up with their pelvis,

[24.56s] which raises their rib cage and even the

[26.24s] rib cage a little more. Now, if you're a

[29.76s] golfer who struggles with staying down,

[31.44s] you're you're like, "Well, I already do

[33.04s] that move." But it's a little different

[34.40s] how they're doing it because they're

[35.60s] adding the tilt to allow themselves to

[37.76s] get to the ground.

[38.88s] >> And that's the big missing piece.

[40.40s] >> This again is learning understanding

[42.08s] that swing is a 3D motion, right? and

[44.56s] what you see on video.
