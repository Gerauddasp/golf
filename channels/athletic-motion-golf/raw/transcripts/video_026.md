[0:00:00] There's two key movements that I think

[0:00:02] golfers are being advised not to do that

[0:00:06] we see every, not most, every great

[0:00:09] player do. And it's the depth that the

[0:00:12] hips create as they rotate. And it's the

[0:00:15] tilt, the forward bend of the pelvis as

[0:00:18] it rotate. You

[0:00:18] know, first of all, it's the tilting of

[0:00:20] the the pelvis anterior posterior. So,

[0:00:23] you know, this is an old TPI kind of

[0:00:26] been around for a long time

[0:00:27] movement screen. And when I first did

[0:00:29] their certification a long time ago,

[0:00:31] this was one that kind of turned my

[0:00:33] light bulbs on like, oh wow, if you

[0:00:35] aren't able to make this movement in the

[0:00:37] swing, you could struggle a little bit

[0:00:40] making the correct movement pattern. So

[0:00:41] it's just an arching and then the

[0:00:43] flattening of the lower back keeping the

[0:00:45] torso dead still. When I first started

[0:00:47] doing it, when most people do it, they

[0:00:49] either shake a lot, which is either a

[0:00:51] restriction or just a motor pattern

[0:00:53] issue. They haven't the brain hasn't

[0:00:54] taught the muscle you how to make the

[0:00:56] movement.
