[0.08s] Your idea of connection is to keep the

[2.24s] arm connected to the rib cage, that's

[4.08s] bad. We don't see good players do that.

[6.08s] >> Yeah.

[6.64s] >> Now, if your idea is just to kind of

[8.48s] keep the armpit connected where you're

[10.64s] not doing this,

[11.84s] >> that's fine. But keeping it connected to

[13.92s] the rib cage, not good. Make a back

[15.76s] swing here to the down the line camera.

[17.44s] >> Sure. Yeah. So, if I take it back here,

[20.00s] >> so what you're describing is that tricep

[23.04s] area kind of getting horizontal with the

[24.72s] ground. and you'll see maybe a few

[25.84s] degrees less or even a few degrees more,

[28.48s] but it's that idea of allowing that arm

[31.76s] in the back swing to lift. Now, that

[34.08s] that happens independent of the turn.

[36.96s] That's just literally what the arm does.

[39.04s] >> And you know, the way we look at

[40.16s] everything is like how do you how do you

[41.76s] make this movement in other sports,

[43.52s] >> right?

[43.84s] >> If I'm going to throw something, that

[45.04s] arm is going to get up there kind of

[46.24s] parallel to the ground. Nobody throws up

[48.00s] here. And if you throw down here,

[49.44s] they're going to put you in right field,

[50.56s] like I always say, because you're really

[51.76s] not going to throw it that far.

[52.88s] >> Yeah. No, that's a great point. And I

[54.40s] would say connection.
