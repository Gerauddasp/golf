[12.48] So, one of our go-to ways to fix this is using our wrist trainer that we sell on the website. And you may have seen one of these before, but this is a little bit different. You go ahead and put it onto the club with this wing nut here.

Well, you can make this arm longer and it really helps you feel a little bit more limited hinge in your wrist here as you make it to the top of the swing.

And the great part about this training aid, not only can you get it on our website, you can go ahead and hit balls with it. It's going to help you get the wrist action correct and hit more solid shots.
