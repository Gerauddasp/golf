One of the best coaches in the world, Scott Hamilton, has a tour player release drill that I absolutely love. No one's immune to working on that stuff in their game, unfortunately. So, just because you see a tour player doing a drill doesn't mean it's a viable drill to do. >> Just because they're doing it doesn't even mean it's the right drill for them. What you're going to do is make little half swings, letting the club up,  down, and kind of swing. I'm not trying to hold the the hands low. I'm not trying to flip it over. I'm just trying to let the club unccock till figured out the the fishing pole. It was like a light bulb went off for me. >> If you don't have a tour like release. >> Yeah. >> And you want a tour-like release, do tour player things. Even the best players in the world aren't immune from doing drills that will ultimately >> make them play not so good. Right? We've had or I should say we've never talked to a tour pro or or worked with one >> where they haven't said, "Man, I wish I wouldn't have spent 6 months doing that drill. It really set me back." >> So, just because you see a tour player doing a drill doesn't mean it's a viable drill to do. >> But just because they're doing it doesn't even mean it's the right drill for them. >> That's exactly right. >> Like, like no one's immune to working on bad stuff in their game, unfortunately. I wish that was the case. >> Like, oh, a tour player is doing it must be great. Yeah, >> one of the best coaches in the world, our good buddy is a mentor to both of us. Scott Hamilton >> has a tour player release drill that I absolutely love. And this is one of those drills that jives perfectly >> with the 3D data of what great players actually do in their swings. And that's >> when you do a drill that that teaches you to do the opposite of what good players do, that's a red flag. This drill is the opposite of that. It teaches you to do exactly what happens with great players. Yeah, I I actually fixed my release with this drill. I can remember it being in the warehouse with him and being like, "Scott, do you think this will help me?" He's like, "Yeah, yeah, just feel like it, you know, uncocks and goes here and then I'll be damned. It fixed my release." >> Okay, so walk us through it then. >> So, I like this one a lot. It's It's a lead hand only swing. And you get a lot of benefit from when uh you grip the club in one hand, especially the lead hand here, cuz it gets heavy. >> You can't It's so difficult to manipulate. >> It almost gets twice as heavy if you thought about it, right? because you got two hands, you got one hand. >> I like your math there. >> Not bad. Um, so first of all, it's got to be, you know, have some leverage in the grip. So, make sure it's, you know, in the base of the fingers here and under the heel pad a little bit so you got some leverage. And then I like to do it with my hand here just to get my hand out of the way. And what you're going to do is make little half swings, letting the club up, down, and kind of swing. And if you do it, you'll feel right away the club will get heavy and inside if you do it wrong. So you pitch it up on plane and then coming through as I straighten the lead side of my body out, I'm letting these angles out of my wrist. I'm not trying to hold the the hands low. I'm not trying to flip it over. I'm just trying to let the club unccock. And the cool part about this drill is the weight of the club will swing and you'll get that beautiful exit. Like I if I was going to do this drill, I'd swing it to like chest high and chest high. And then I started putting my other hand on it. This drill literally transformed my golf swing. It's when I fig also figured out the the fishing pole. It was like a light bulb went off for me. >> So when we when we have golfers when we explain this to golfers in lessons, they try it for the first time almost without exception. There's going to be >> this kind of movement with the lead arm. >> This is why I added this piece in. >> So it's going to be here and it's going to be to get the left exit. So, it's like pull the handle across, which leaves the face wide open. The club's usually a foot off the ground, and then they think this is that left exit. If Sean will do one where he's kind of facing that way towards the camera, you're going to see this hands are still on the trail side of the body and the club lines up and swivels with it out here, not back here. This is when I figured out for my own game and then with my students and our students how to get the left exit the right way. How to get the lowish kind of rib cage exit that I've always liked personally. I love that look. >> It's not from this. >> Yeah. You see good players that exit like I I watched David Thompson a million balls cuz I worked for him and I was enamored with the exit that he had. It just never looked like you get hit it offline. And I was always trying to do it with the hand path, >> pulling the the hands around you. Right now, that's what everyone thinks. >> If you grab a club like this and chip a foam ball like this and have your body motion supported, I hold it like this because my tendency was to pull the arm. So, I keep it across my body more. And it's this motion, the club lining up and swiveing and swinging past my hand. If I do that with good support from the body, it was the first time ever I I saw on video. I'm like, that's that's that's it. >> So, you've allowed the weight of the club to start swinging, >> right? And not like pull it off. It's much more of a swinging motion. Then you start to keep the body up with it. And then, like you said, that club exits completely different because it's not you're not disrupting its arc. which is why I am not a fan of people trying to get this like what is it like a umbrella type >> well it's it's the low punch again it's it's it's training the opposite of what happens which is dangerous >> you know you look at like a macroy like maybe the greatest driver of the ball and super high long irons which is very handy nowadays right if you want to win lots of money >> and drivers >> it's this you can see it on gear is how much swivel he has and how that club swings back up the plane And it's not this motion. It's just not. >> And you know, Rory likes to hit big high draws. He can hit fades. We have faders only. Guys who only play fades do the same thing. >> Same thing. >> It's not a draw or fade move, not a hook or slice. >> It's a natural releasing action. That's why when you put one hand on, the club gets heavy. It's hard to manipulate it. You just let it swing the weight of it with good supporting body movements. And I I would stand here. Stand right there. And I'll show you like this is the speed I would do this for hours and I would put my other hand on and then I would watch the video and it would be the prettiest around the corner motion. >> Let's do that one more time. And I want you to hold that finish with the then put the other hand on. >> Yeah. Yeah. >> I mean, >> so you didn't move your body to put your hand on. >> No. >> Now, because we've seen so many golfers do that. Let me get make sure I get the right camera here. when you do this and exit [Music] and it they just again it's where the concept meets reality doesn't jive. >> The other thing I figured out by doing this drill cuz I practiced for years hitting punch shots with my arms straight. It It ruined my golf swing because I >> done that rib cracker drill to death. >> It It literally ruined my swing because I couldn't get my long irons up in the air. I started blocking drivers. that that's what happens when you overdo that. So, what I figured out with was this is this why this drill is so good for a lot of golfers, including me, is when I did it right, the left arm actually folds some to get the club where it needs to be. Then you just put your other hand on. You're not trying to keep your arms ramrod straight >> in the back swing, right? >> The right arm folds. >> The right arm folds and works around as it works up. In the down swing, it's like a left-handed back swing. The same thing happens. There's a lot of symmetry when you look at the movements of the swing. >> You're so much better off learning to hit the ball with this motion, letting this club swing, than you are trying to cheat compression and shaft by hitting shots like this. Your long-term progression of the game is going to be so much better. If you learn to have shaft lean as you're letting out, >> right, >> the club, let letting the club swing, it transfers so much better to real golf. Can you do this too much? >> Yes. >> Exhibit A, exhibit B. >> I mean, >> can you plane the club too much? >> No. >> Can you be too on plane? >> No. >> On both sides of the ball? >> No. >> Okay. So, it's again, it's another one of those drills that you can do as much as you physically can stand to do. >> Yeah. And and I just did it with a foam ball. Um, the other thing it helped me with is it it I think I mentioned this earlier, but it forces you to pitch the club up the right way on the back swing because again it gets heavy and you can't even complete the drill >> or the opposite, right? Or this kind of back swing, hands in, club out. Again, it gets it just makes the club swing on an arc. >> And when I get in trouble with my swing, this is becomes my pre-shot routine. I just let the club swing, extend the body, let this club swing around me. I might grab it here just like I got to be feeling that halfway through. And I always thought, oh, if I do that, I'm going to over hook the ball. No, the club is swinging lines up square when you do it. You don't have to put a lot of twisting action on the on the face. >> So, the takeaway here for this video, if you don't have a tour like release, Yeah. >> and you want a tour-like release, do tour player things. exactly what that drill is. Don't do non-our player things. You'll start to develop. Again, you do a thousand of those or a thousand of these, I can tell you which one you're going to hit it better. >> Yeah. Go down to Orange County National. >> Yeah. >> 100 guys or gals, golfers do this, and the other ones we teach do this. And >> the ones that do this end up getting better at golf. >> You're going to like your ball flight a whole lot better. So, if you're new to the channel, thank you for being here. Watch the video.
