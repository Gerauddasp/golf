And there's a reason why I'm not setting it super early because that momentum is going to help you even more retain some of that lag.

[39.28s] >> We create kind of a little float up there.

[41.52s] >> I I love that thought. That little float as the club finishes. I'm starting to unwind. As that club is floating and finishing the the back swing, I'm going to turn and reconnect the trail arm to the body. And look, you can even increase the lag angle
