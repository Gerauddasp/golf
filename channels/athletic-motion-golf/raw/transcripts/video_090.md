[0.16s] This is the worst way to grip a club.

[3.04s] Standing here at your normal address and

[5.04s] just swinging your hand down. When you

[6.879s] do that, it gets it too much in the palm

[9.04s] as opposed to having it more in the base

[10.88s] of the fingers where the heel pad can be

[12.639s] on top. So, what's the easiest way to do

[14.559s] that? The best and easiest way is just

[16.72s] do a drill like you see tour players

[18.72s] using. They either have the hand behind

[20.64s] them this way, which automatically puts

[22.48s] it in that part of your hand, or you

[24.4s] could put it in front of you this way.

[26.48s] Because the arm is rotated differently,

[28.32s] it makes it a lot easier to get it under

[30.0s] that heel pad of your hand. If you do

[31.92s] that, you'll feel a lot freer hinge in

[33.92s] the wrist. You can release the club and

[36.399s] get more club head speed and hit the

[38.559s] ball a lot straighter.
