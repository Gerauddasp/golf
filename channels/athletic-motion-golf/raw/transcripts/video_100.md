[0.08s] a literally pass or fail drill. I

[2.48s] haven't seen anybody else teach it this

[3.76s] way. What we have people do is say,

[5.2s] "Hey, listen. I want you to make a

[6.72s] swing, but I want you to put the brakes

[8.16s] on right here." They would go, "Okay,

[9.599s] yeah, sure. I can do it." They'll do

[12.16s] something like that. Sean's hips are a

[14.24s] little bit open. His chest is a little

[16.48s] bit closed and his clubs way below

[19.039s] parallel to the ground. What we want him

[20.72s] to do is something that looks more like

[23.84s] that right there. So the hands are still

[26.32s] above the waist and the knees have

[28s] squared up and the hand line is still

[30.72s] back here and the club is on plane where

[33.28s] I can deliver this. His upper arm is on

[35.6s] the same rough line as his midline of

[38.64s] his torso, his back line. So the

[40.48s] practice here is to go like intent like

[42.96s] you're going to hit, but put the brakes

[44.48s] on and then film that and see where you

[47.039s] end up. If you can get to there and put

[48.719s] the brakes on, you know that you've

[50.16s] organized this correctly and you've got

[52.48s] the stretch here in the middle of the

[53.84s] swing. That's going to go a long ways

[55.199s] for more club head speed and it gives

[57.12s] you a lot more control of the club
