[0.08s] so much confusion. Do I close the gap

[1.76s] immediately? Do I close the shoulders

[4.24s] over the hips the whole down swing?

[6.08s] >> That is what some of you may be trying

[8.08s] to do. It's kind of what suggested in

[9.76s] some circles that the you do the

[12.32s] shoulders and that will close and keep

[14.00s] the pelvis open. It's not it's just not

[16.56s] what great players do. And I think doing

[19.12s] the opposite of what great players do

[20.88s] can be really dicey. um they've kind of

[23.60s] got it figured out over generations and

[25.52s] it's pretty homogeneous as far as this

[28.00s] aspect of this lazy susan concept while

[30.24s] that's happening. So while the lazy

[32.08s] susan is turning and bringing everything

[34.56s] above it around the arms are just

[38.48s] >> lowering and reconnecting. That's what

[40.16s] produces that classic good swing on

[42.80s] plane look that you see from every

[44.56s] player.
