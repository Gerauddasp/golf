[0.08s] One of the top requests is I want to get

[1.68s] more rotation at impact. And then while

[3.84s] we're watching them warm up, they'll try

[6.32s] to get open, try to get open, and you'll

[9.60s] see some really odd stuff with this

[12.88s] trail leg that is killing their ability

[16.00s] to get open. First of all, we never

[17.52s] really teach a whole lot of getting open

[19.68s] because once this club gets in a better

[21.36s] spot, unless you're doing something

[22.56s] unnatural down below here, your body's

[25.12s] going to naturally open up cuz that's

[26.48s] the only way to get the club to come

[27.76s] back out in front of you if it's in a

[29.84s] good spot coming down. So, and to get it

[32.00s] in a good spot coming down, you have to

[33.36s] make a good back swing. So, again, if

[35.04s] you're having trouble with that, that's

[36.40s] the first place you got to look.

[37.68s] >> Well, we had a a lesson yesterday. Guy

[40.00s] was a lot of closed in the back swing,

[42.88s] 29° open at impact. We said, "Hey, we

[45.68s] got to get more open at impact by fixing

[48.16s] the back swing." That's all we told him.

[50.00s] We didn't tell him to do anything else

[51.60s] to get more open. 15 minutes later, he

[53.76s] was 42, 43 degrees open and his back

[56.64s] swing was better. It's like it getting

[58.40s] open is a result of what happens happens

[61.12s] before it.
