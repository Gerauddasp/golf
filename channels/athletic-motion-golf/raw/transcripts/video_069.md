## Raw Transcript

[0:00:00.08] Have you ever seen golfers struggle with

[0:00:01.76] an inside takeaway?

[0:00:02.80] >> All of them.

[0:00:03.20] >> In the five swings that you took, it red

[0:00:05.68] flagged with bright red numbers. Back

[0:00:08.32] swing.

[0:00:08.72] >> I tend to get the club a little inside

[0:00:11.36] before it gets above my hands.

[0:00:14.639] >> Okay. Do you notice any difference?

[0:00:16.40] >> I I feel like I'm keeping the club a

[0:00:18.32] little more on the other side of my

[0:00:19.60] hands longer. If I do that and add the

[0:00:22.00] turn,

[0:00:23.68] that's way better.

[0:00:25.119] >> We got red.

[0:00:26.00] >> So that's what people are doing. They're

[0:00:28.32] statically checking the takeaway like

[0:00:30.08] this without having this motion of the

[0:00:32.80] body to go along with it.

[0:00:34.079] >> Sean just made five swings and we've got

[0:00:36.00] him hooked up in Hack Motion on his lead

[0:00:37.76] arm and we're going to use the software

[0:00:40.32] the app for Hack Motion to kind of

[0:00:42.64] identify where he needs to practice

[0:00:44.96] today. So in the five swings that you

[0:00:47.44] took it red flagged with bright red

[0:00:50.719] numbers back swing.

[0:00:52.559] >> Okay.

[0:00:52.96] >> Okay. Does that sound abnormal?

[0:00:54.96] >> No. tend to get it like a little bit

[0:00:57.039] inside and take away. Yep. Yep.

[0:00:58.879] >> So, we're going to click on back swing,

[0:01:00.239] see what it recommends. Right off the

[0:01:02.48] bat, the very first thing is inside

[0:01:04.559] takeaway drill.

[0:01:05.36] >> Yep. So, I have always had a tendency I

[0:01:07.36] always have to keep an eye on it because

[0:01:08.479] we always had the cameras running when

[0:01:09.76] I'm hitting balls. I tend to get the

[0:01:11.68] club a little inside before it gets

[0:01:14.159] above my hands. And I prefer it kind of

[0:01:16.32] working through my hands and and up the

[0:01:18.479] plane that way.

[0:01:19.439] >> How many years you've been teaching now?

[0:01:22.40] over 20

[0:01:24.40] 20 something years. 20.

[0:01:25.759] >> Have you ever seen golfers struggle with

[0:01:27.52] an inside takeaway?

[0:01:28.56] >> All of them.

[0:01:29.04] >> What do you mean everyone?

[0:01:30.56] >> Everyone.

[0:01:33.28] >> Okay. So, this is going to this is going

[0:01:35.439] to be beneficial for a lot of you

[0:01:37.60] watching this video. This is a very

[0:01:39.04] common fault.

[0:01:40.799] >> Even good players, right? We've seen

[0:01:42.799] tour players that that get the club

[0:01:44.56] going inside too much, right? So, no

[0:01:47.36] one's immune from this. And I think

[0:01:49.68] everyone can benefit from this drill.

[0:01:52.079] So, we're going to do the inside

[0:01:53.68] takeaway drill, aptly named. And what

[0:01:56.799] I'm going to have you do is set up to

[0:01:59.52] the ball.

[0:02:00.399] >> Mhm.

[0:02:02.159] >> Okay. You're going to hear a little

[0:02:03.52] click.

[0:02:05.04] Okay. Let me turn that up. It just

[0:02:06.719] clicked.

[0:02:07.52] >> Okay.

[0:02:08.00] >> Okay. Now, make your takeaway.

[0:02:14.239] >> I feel it buzzing.

[0:02:16.00] >> Okay. Good. All right. All right, we're

[0:02:17.68] going to reset it. Going to listen for

[0:02:19.52] the click. Okay, take it away.

[0:02:23.20] >> Okay. Do you notice any difference in

[0:02:25.20] what you're having to do?

[0:02:26.16] >> I'm doing this on purpose cuz I'm going

[0:02:27.76] slow. I I feel like I'm keeping the club

[0:02:29.76] a little more on the other side of my

[0:02:31.28] hands longer.

[0:02:32.16] >> Okay.

[0:02:32.72] >> Instead of where I usually get the club

[0:02:34.8] swinging back a little bit too much and

[0:02:36.64] get my lead wrist a little flexed, which

[0:02:38.56] carries into the top. And

[0:02:40.16] >> that's a good point. A lot of golfers

[0:02:41.92] we've seen will practice putting the

[0:02:44.40] club in the right place

[0:02:47.76] as like, boom, that looks good. But

[0:02:50.48] there's no momentum to that. So soon as

[0:02:53.92] they add momentum and turn to it, now

[0:02:55.599] the club's way inside.

[0:02:57.20] >> Yeah. Well, if I just did my if I just

[0:02:59.44] did my hands and wrists,

[0:03:00.959] >> do do it again. Start it over. Get the

[0:03:02.40] click.

[0:03:05.12] >> Okay.

[0:03:08.56] So if I just did my hands and wrists

[0:03:10.40] like this. Oh,

[0:03:11.36] >> so you can manufacture. That's not a

[0:03:13.04] takeaway though. Nothing else moved. If

[0:03:15.20] I do that and add the turn,

[0:03:20.08] >> that's way we got rid.

[0:03:22.48] >> So that's what people are doing.

[0:03:24.8] >> Yes.

[0:03:25.20] >> They're statically checking the takeaway

[0:03:26.959] like this without having this motion of

[0:03:29.76] the body to go along with it. And this

[0:03:32.239] might look good to your eye just setting

[0:03:34.48] it there, but when you add the momentum

[0:03:35.92] to that wrist action, you're way inside.

[0:03:38.879] >> Something else that we'll notice golfers

[0:03:41.04] doing, and we'll see this when they come

[0:03:42.48] in and warm up for a lesson,

[0:03:45.04] >> is they're so used to checking it in a

[0:03:47.68] mirror,

[0:03:48.48] >> like their back swing is like this where

[0:03:50.319] their head shifts away and watches it.

[0:03:52.64] So, you're getting a false sense for

[0:03:54.48] where things are in space. And then when

[0:03:56.799] you watch the ball and swing, like you

[0:03:58.56] said, things get sucked to inside. So, I

[0:04:01.519] like how you're practicing this by

[0:04:03.12] keeping your head over the shot like you

[0:04:05.20] wouldn't want to.

[0:04:06.239] >> One of the val valuable things about it,

[0:04:08.239] I can just stay in my normal posture and

[0:04:10.319] I can even add a little speed to it.

[0:04:12.159] >> Okay, let's go. Get our get our click

[0:04:17.359] >> and I and I'm able to do it right.

[0:04:18.88] >> So, we've got a shift going now. We've

[0:04:20.479] got some speed.

[0:04:21.519] >> So, I feel like I'm keeping the same

[0:04:23.12] bend in the back of my lead wrist.

[0:04:24.8] Probably not actually happening, but you

[0:04:26.479] know, my feel is important. So, I feel

[0:04:29.36] like I'm keeping that same extension in

[0:04:31.84] my lead wrist from address to takeaway.

[0:04:34.96] >> Um,

[0:04:35.84] >> you bring up a good point. The graph

[0:04:37.84] will show there's movement in that.

[0:04:39.52] >> Yeah.

[0:04:40.00] >> But because the club head is under the

[0:04:42.08] hands, as soon as you move it, the

[0:04:44.16] weight of that club head will change

[0:04:46.4] wrist angles. Okay. Wrist angles are

[0:04:48.479] like pressure. Like the smallest

[0:04:50.72] movement in the club will change your

[0:04:52.4] wrist. We don't have vices on the club

[0:04:55.199] to keep it from moving. So knowing that

[0:04:58.639] there's going to be movement, but your

[0:05:00.479] thought is to feel like your hands are

[0:05:02.479] in a cast and they're not moving much at

[0:05:04.72] all. We see way too much under rolling

[0:05:07.6] of the club going back.

[0:05:08.96] >> Well, and it's it's a combination of a

[0:05:11.199] few things. You know, golfers thinking

[0:05:12.639] that in order to stop slicing it, they

[0:05:14.32] should twist the face close right off

[0:05:15.759] the bat and take away it. You're causing

[0:05:18.08] more harm than good. You may you need to

[0:05:19.759] learn the correct movements all the way

[0:05:21.28] from the dress to impact. Don't try to

[0:05:23.68] cheat it by closing it early because all

[0:05:26.00] you're doing is getting yourself already

[0:05:28.72] inside and low.

[0:05:29.84] >> Well, and you haven't used your body

[0:05:31.12] yet.

[0:05:31.44] >> Yeah. You do that and then

[0:05:32.479] >> you do and you add body, you'll either

[0:05:34.16] not use your body or hit it terribly.

[0:05:36.24] >> And people say, "Well, nobody does

[0:05:37.44] that." Trust me, we've had a million

[0:05:39.44] shots hit in this building already.

[0:05:40.88] >> Today was our millionth shot.

[0:05:43.039] >> There was a guy in here two weeks ago

[0:05:45.68] that we've got plenty of room, right?

[0:05:49.199] plenty of room behind the golfer and he

[0:05:51.6] had this bend it first then turn. I had

[0:05:54.72] to be like, "Hey, just keep an eye out

[0:05:56.24] with the driver because I just happened

[0:05:57.28] to walk by and glance and I had to be

[0:05:59.6] like, "Hey, you know, maybe try to get

[0:06:01.36] the club going up a little because

[0:06:02.4] you're awfully close." And and that's an

[0:06:04.00] example of somebody he's he was a

[0:06:05.6] slicer. He was taught to kind of bow it.

[0:06:07.84] Yep.

[0:06:08.24] >> Early and then make his swing and it was

[0:06:10.16] just hard to watch.

[0:06:12.56] >> Feedback's great. It's why we love hack

[0:06:14.639] motion. Looking at this is old school,

[0:06:17.039] right? and you get into a lot of bad

[0:06:18.4] habits with that or just doing like you

[0:06:20.319] said without turning the body something

[0:06:22.96] in play whether it's Hack Motion, Swing

[0:06:25.44] Coach, any of these apps with the

[0:06:27.84] feedback for flexion extension like

[0:06:30.16] we're really getting granular with Hack

[0:06:31.759] Motion to really dial in your swing. any

[0:06:34.24] of these will provide the feedback you

[0:06:36.08] need to make golf swing movements and

[0:06:39.68] and know where everything's moving in

[0:06:41.44] space because that's the hardest part

[0:06:42.479] about the golf swing is it leaves our

[0:06:44.96] vision and it's back behind us and you

[0:06:47.12] need something to let you know where

[0:06:48.4] it's at. I think there's something too

[0:06:49.84] about you you have to be bent forward to

[0:06:52.08] hit a shot and kind of your

[0:06:53.28] equilibrium's a little bit off from

[0:06:54.88] standing. Like I can probably tell you

[0:06:56.56] standing up pretty much where this is.

[0:06:59.12] You start bending forward out of your

[0:07:01.599] normal standing our normal orientation

[0:07:04.08] right now. I put the club somewhere and

[0:07:06.00] the hands is I'm a little more um I'm

[0:07:09.12] not as aware of where things are in

[0:07:10.8] >> and that applies to all skill levels.

[0:07:13.759] Okay, we've distracted you. Let's go

[0:07:15.36] back to the drill.

[0:07:16.16] >> Yeah. And we're going to use that same

[0:07:18.479] feel of like your your both of your

[0:07:20.479] hands. You have one big cast over your

[0:07:22.639] grip and hands. Okay. Let's see if you

[0:07:24.96] make it take away. Get it in green. Can

[0:07:28.00] I get the click? Yep.

[0:07:30.56] >> Okay.

[0:07:33.039] >> There we go.

[0:07:34.319] >> So, there's not much of anything you're

[0:07:37.599] trying to do with the hands and wrist to

[0:07:40.08] put yourself in a good takeaway.

[0:07:42.72] >> No. Like, they're totally in a cast now.

[0:07:46.639] There's some I have a little bit of up

[0:07:48.479] here now, you know, that I'm feeling to

[0:07:50.479] to take to get the club up off the

[0:07:52.88] ground, but man, I can put that in such

[0:07:54.479] a good spot. And I'm literally feeling

[0:07:56.56] like

[0:07:57.759] >> I'm not changing this action.

[0:08:00.319] >> Right. That's the key. That's the

[0:08:02.00] takeaway if you struggle with an inside

[0:08:03.52] takeaway is adding a bunch of that

[0:08:06.24] flexion with the lead wrist.

[0:08:07.599] >> Let me try one more.

[0:08:11.52] >> Yeah, I I can do that, right? I mean,

[0:08:13.28] that's something I can go and play with

[0:08:15.039] today. and I have the right feeling in

[0:08:18.319] my wrist to make a a good takeaway. And

[0:08:20.4] that's going to bleed through my bag.

[0:08:21.36] I'm gonna hit my wedges better. I can

[0:08:23.199] change direction and the club's in a

[0:08:24.72] better spot. I tend to get the face a

[0:08:26.639] little shot going back. It's going to

[0:08:28.08] alleviate that. So, you know, if I'm

[0:08:29.84] taking a lesson today, I'm super happy.

[0:08:31.919] And not only am I happy that I can get

[0:08:34.159] good information in the lesson, Mike can

[0:08:36.399] send me home with a hack motion

[0:08:37.919] basically, right? I can have this to

[0:08:40.00] take to my house because that's the

[0:08:41.519] problem between lessons. Golfers get

[0:08:44.159] lost. They don't know if they're doing

[0:08:46.16] it right or not. And even if they're

[0:08:48.00] looking in a mirror or or they're

[0:08:49.68] videoing themselves,

[0:08:51.44] >> this is data that they can have with

[0:08:54.32] them and say, "Is that wrong or right?"

[0:08:56.399] And have a definitive answer.

[0:08:58.08] >> All of these things are feel

[0:08:59.279] calibrators. What you may feel when you

[0:09:01.839] go get your lesson, if it's the best

[0:09:03.6] lesson in the world, that feel is going

[0:09:06.72] to fade over time and need to be

[0:09:09.04] recalibrated. This lets you calibrate it

[0:09:11.44] every single time you practice.

[0:09:12.959] >> Yeah. And then, you know, if I was

[0:09:14.24] working on this, I would probably do

[0:09:15.519] what I just did there. I'd probably get

[0:09:17.44] it set, see if I can do it, and then I'd

[0:09:20.32] finish the swing and chip one. And then

[0:09:22.24] gradually, I would do that enough. And

[0:09:23.839] then I would try to do it one more time

[0:09:28.32] and see if I could feel it through the

[0:09:30.56] takeaway here and then make go ahead and

[0:09:32.56] make a swing and see what it looks like

[0:09:33.76] on video. That's

[0:09:34.56] >> exactly right.

[0:09:35.04] >> And then you would be able to see, oh,

[0:09:36.399] my club is less low and shut. It's a

[0:09:38.24] little more out in front. If I do that,

[0:09:40.959] I know I'm on the right track. I'm

[0:09:42.56] building confidence in my swing. I'm

[0:09:44.24] moving things in the right direction and

[0:09:45.92] I'm a happy camper.

[0:09:46.959] >> If you're interested in getting a Hack

[0:09:48.24] Motion, check out the link down below

[0:09:49.839] the video in the first pin comment. It's

[0:09:51.6] a great tool for a lot of reasons. This

[0:09:53.6] is just happens to pop up in Shawn's

[0:09:55.519] swing as his biggest issue.

[0:09:57.839] >> Yeah, it has been. I mean,

[0:09:59.76] >> we we use this a lot in lessons. It's a

[0:10:02.16] lot of people's biggest issue. If

[0:10:04.16] the club gets off track early, the rest of

[0:10:06.48] the swing is trying to make up for it

[0:10:08.72] when that was not a complicated move to

[0:10:10.8] fix it.

[0:10:11.2] >> No. Great product, great company.
