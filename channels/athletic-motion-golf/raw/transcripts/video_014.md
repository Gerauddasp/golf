[0:00] that is not the solution for coming up

[0:02] >> in the down swing. There's something

[0:04] going on and a lot of times the top one

[0:06] or two reasons. One would be an overly

[0:08] steep club, right? Coming out of the

[0:10] top, it would crash into the ground if I

[0:12] didn't kind of pop up and and throw a

[0:13] shallow in there, right? Two shallows

[0:15] standing up and throwing. The other one

[0:17] would be, you know, if my weight would

[0:19] be too far back and I was going to crash

[0:20] into the ground, I'll I'll pop up and

[0:22] kind of flick it again. And the other

[0:24] one probably, you know, if you're too

[0:26] far underneath, you would crash in the

[0:27] ground. He might pop up and kind of hit

[0:29] a big push or or a hook,

[0:31] >> right? And you'll see not only the head

[0:33] lift, which is what everybody focuses

[0:34] on, which is a little bit of an

[0:36] illusion, but you'll see the body really

[0:38] lift. And

[0:39] >> I mean, we've had a lot of swing videos,

[0:41] just online lessons or inerson lessons

[0:44] where at impact the upper body is pretty

[0:46] vertical.

[0:47] >> Yeah. If they didn't, they would hurt

[0:48] themselves or drive the club into

[0:50] >> Yeah. or lose their club head into the

[0:51] ground. To do the opposite of that,

[0:54] we'll see. They'll either come in doing

[0:56] that in lessons or we'll come in and get

[0:57] the guy that's just both hips back

[1:00] coming down and pretty much squared back

[1:02] up at the top because they see theirel

[1:04] on video not lifting. So

[1:06] >> like that.
