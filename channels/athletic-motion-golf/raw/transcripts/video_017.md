[0.08s] When when we go play, if we're waiting

[2.00s] for the the hole to clear or we're just,

[3.76s] you know, we got somebody else playing

[4.96s] with us, you'll look over and invariably

[6.96s] you'll see Shawn taking himself like

[9.44s] from about here to here to impact, just

[44.64s] times. I might take it back waist high

[46.08s] to waist high. Just feel that motion

[48.00s] through there. And if I'm on the range,

[50.48s] I may pose it and then take it back

[52.00s] waist high and just chip some balls out
