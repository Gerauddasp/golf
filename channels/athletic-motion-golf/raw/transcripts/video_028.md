[0.08s - 3.76s] Gomez or tell us. I've never had to clean my clubs. I don't get dirty. But

[3.76s - 7.6s] you're also robbing yourself of some compression if you're not able to take a

[7.6s - 9.2s] divot.

[7.92s - 11.6s] >> When we say take a divot, we mean take a divot in front of the ball.

[10.16s - 14.08s] >> In front of the ball. The key point, the good kind of divot.

[12.4s - 14.96s] >> Yeah. Everybody can take a divot behind the ball,

[35.68s - 41.04s] >> There's some things you can do to mess it up. One of them is trying to think that you're holding this lag all the way through the hit.

[41.76s - 46.8s] >> Well, it goes back to the conversation of this angle being lag, right? Maintain

[46.8s - 51.52s] that angle all the way into the swing. Well, you can see how short that makes

[51.52s - 56s] the club. So if this is address, if I just maintain that my club's shorter to

[56s - 60s] the ground than if I let that angle
