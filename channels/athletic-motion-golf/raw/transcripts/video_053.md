[0.08s] There are really three big reasons why

[2.48s] golfers cast and we see them kind of

[4.56s] equally throughout the day in lessons.

[6.56s] The first is how they hold the club like

[9.44s] especially with the trail hand and where

[11.679s] that thumb sits on the club.

[13.2s] >> Trail hand definitely lead hand too. Get

[15.28s] it in the Yeah. Get it in the the base

[16.88s] of your lead hand. So the fatty part of

[18.72s] your palm is on top of the club.

[20.32s] >> Okay. I

[20.72s] >> think we call it the heel pad. I don't

[21.92s] know if that's the right name for it,

[22.88s] but do that first. Then get your right

[25.039s] hand. You know the golfers that do this

[27.039s] wrong, grab it like a like a hammer.

[29.439s] Yep. Yep.

[30.16s] >> And the club doesn't really have a a

[32.8s] place. It just kind of wobbles around.

[35.28s] And when you do that, you tend to lose

[37.44s] control of the club. The other part of

[39.2s] it, you could have your thumb on top,

[40.64s] your trail thumb on top of the grip too

[42.239s] much, and it makes you leverage the club

[43.68s] too much. So that's kind of the couple

[45.6s] reasons, first of all, why you

[47.52s] >> Yeah, we'll actually see that start off,

[49.44s] okay? And then you'll see, film

[51.52s] yourself. You'll see the kind of the the

[54s] thumb glide off at some point in the

[56.079s] back swing. And now you've got just a

[58.32s] real kind of um baggy hole for a narrow

[63.44s] grip. Too much air in the grip. You're

[65.04s] leaking air in your grip and that

[66.88s] bounces around. And then this one we

[68.56s] don't see as much, but man, you you see

[70.72s] that look on the thumb

[71.84s] >> can lever the club. And you're going to

[72.96s] see a cast.
