## Raw Transcript

One of the best tips I ever heard I heard from a PJ tour player was how to hit the high soft shot around the green almost like a flop. The way he explained it was open the face, lean your weight left, but that wasn't the most important part. The most important part was to make a long slow swing. So, it's the slowness of the tempo back and through that allows you to slide the club under the ball and pop it up. So, even on a short shot, you're going to make a long slow swing. That ball pops straight up in the air. It'll stop close to the hole and maybe you can make the putt.
