One of our golf school attendees from two golf schools ago was actually making a pretty good swing at it and he just like was not hitting it good down by the ball. Watching him live when we're first greeting him on the first day. It's like that's a pretty good looking swing. Then you start putting the camera on him, you put him in gears, you say, "Okay, he's making a move that is so common right now and it is absolutely a down swing killer. You can make a great back swing. If your intent is to do this one move, it's going to ruin your down swing. And that was driving the elbow, getting it out in front of his body. And he was putting himself in a good position at the top. And you can see he was just trying to get that move going right there. And that was brutal for the down swing. What should be happening instead? And what does happen with great players, >> as soon as you start pulling on that elbow in front too much, the hand path will start pushing way out toward the ball. And now you've got another set of issues. And also, it's more of an opener. Like if I just held the club like this and drive that elbow, you can see the action. You're putting an action on the club and the club's going to respond. So that's that motion. But a lot of you are going to shank it like that. >> Now, we've got to qualify this with a couple things. I've seen a number of coaches online teaching this exact movement. Got to get the elbow in front. You got to do this. You got to do that and get to get it up there. And then they'll hit a ball. And this is where you as the consumer of golf information have to start to take ownership. Meaning when you see a golfer or a player or a coach recommend a move and then they hit a ball, screen record when they hit the ball. Because the coaches that I see do this movement will hit a ball and it'll be nothing like that. You've got to learn the real of what happens. What you may feel your toes cross to get in the right position. It doesn't matter. But so many golfers will chase a feel and start doing that feel to their detriment. That's where it becomes insanely bad for your swing. Especially if you're a coordinated, athletic person >> and you practice >> and you practice. You have to be very careful what you tell somebody that can do what you're asking them to do. >> And be very careful when someone tells you what it should feel like. You have to earn what it feels like. You can't be told what it feels like. If we strip away all the movement, the body movement, the swing, and we just talk about, okay, I get to the top of my back swing. So, it looks something like this, right? My elbows are not together apart. I'm just lowering to the side of my body to where I get my arm somewhere around the angle of my shirt seam. That's all we're trying to do. That's all great players do. >> Yeah. If you just kind of get there and lower it, that put you in a good spot. You even see some good players, they're adding a little bit of this action. That's exactly right. >> It doesn't mean the club's doing that. The club can be pitched back still. >> There's a caveat with that. They're doing that because the lower body is moving quickly. >> Yeah. >> Okay. Okay. So, the some players have very quick lower bodies. >> If I just go back to this same movement here, here, and if I just move my lower body and lower my arm, now my hips out in front. You see a lot of great players do that. Yeah. >> They're not doing that by pulling the arm behind them. >> It's a completely different move. >> That's why you got to be careful seeing something that happens, which is, >> you know, kinematic look to the kinetics of what >> seeing it and be able to measure >> what happened. What are they what are they doing to have that look? It's not just that. >> Jim Furick would be a huge example of that. >> Exactly. Right. >> If we know that the arm's just got to fall back to my side and I'm trying to keep it on my side or it stays on my side with every good player you've ever seen, whether it's Hogan, Trevino, Mo Nororman, you can go on down the list. That's what happens. No one does this. And this goes back to the idea of this is skipping a stone. We'll put up on the screen what a actual world record holder professional I didn't even know there were professional stone skippers >> I didn't it's this movement it's never this movement so I don't know where that came from the idea of the skip a stone is the drive the elbow in front but don't do it for stone skipping and don't do it for um your golf swing for sure >> I think you know you you would kind of that but as you start it but by the time you throw it it's that way >> but it never gets in front. No, it's trailing your >> Yes, it's always behind. >> I can actually do it a lot. So, I only grew up on an island, so that's all we did was skip rocks. Literally, we didn't have iPhones. We have rock literally rock skipping contrast. This is no lie. I think I got 50 one time. And it's you have first of all, you got to find the perfect rock. >> You got to get a good rock. >> You learn to size up the rock. Flat, heavy enough, but not too heavy, not too light. It's the wind to take it. And you you hold it like this. You your arm back. You pivot your body first. >> Yes. >> You're pivoting. Pivoting. Zoom. Then you flick it. It does never get >> you. You wouldn't get it way in front of your belt. Your body is kind of leading like like that. >> Yeah. And it's it's this movement like it's which is what we talked about so many times where the elbow works out and around. It's never the elbow works under and in. >> It's it's one of those moves like if you just took the club in one hand, you start to get I don't want to kill my I use a phone ball. If if I told someone to hit this ball right now holding the club in one hand and I told them to drive the elbow in front of the >> No chance. >> Yeah. You couldn't. >> Now with two hands, you might be able to twist it enough to horse it around. But look at how almost unplayable that is. >> So you know you can learn a lot just by one hand like oh that that that what I'm doing to that club won't really work. You have to let it lower then the arm works differently. So the club comes down in front and then I see I can almost hit my face. >> That was impressive. I didn't know you were going to actually hit that one. That was impressive. Missed my shin was what I was mainly worried about. So the difference then is okay. Whatever that felt like to you probably not going to feel like to me. Okay. So telling someone feel like you're doing this or even not even say feel just start demonstrating this is what needs to happen. Very irresponsible or just outright malpractice when we call it. Right? So you've got to understand what the real should happen. Like if I know that doesn't happen, why would I want to try to practice that happening? Hopefully it feeling like that. >> What if it doesn't feel like that? What if I actually start doing that? >> Well, then I become a way worse golfer. >> I forget who said it. I mean, I've heard it from a lot of good teachers over the years. Like I think Martin Hall is like, "You have to be real careful what you tell a good player or coordinated player cuz they'll do it. >> They'll actually end up getting in front and then there's like why am I shanking the ball doing what my teacher told me?" So anyway, just be careful. Open champ told us they never shank the ball until they tried to do that move. And again, this a highly highly skilled golfer was told to do that and they did it. She goes, "It took me two balls to do it." And I shanked the second ball that I actually did it on. >> Like, I'm out. >> So, it there's no harm in knowing what should happen. >> Then you can practice it. Who cares what it feels like? If it feels like you're taking your elbow to your car in the parking lot, big deal. It's your feel. Feels are going to be unique. What you do is what matters. So, what's a good way to practice the correct movement here? >> I think most of it is, you know, get the club up to the top and learn to reattach the the arm kind of to the side, the rib cage on its way down to, you know, the the motion is lowering >> and then if I didn't turn at all, the arm would go like that. So, so learning that lowering and rotation motion kind of out little bit of a 45ish. Now, granted, I'm turning, so that's going to end up zeroing out the path. basically. But if you can learn the action of the arm, >> that motion, it's definitely not a rock skip. I will say that. Take it, take it from the me, Uncle Rico, of rock skipping. It lowers and it goes that way. And if you can do that and just put your other hand on, you'll see that. Oh yeah, it is kind of just lowering down. I don't have to pitch the arm in a way that makes it go this way, which, oh, by the way, most people think about opening just by twisting. You're also opening when you when this plane when this whole plane flattens this way, which is a which is what you're doing with that arm motion. >> Film yourself doing this, please. Like, we can't say that enough. Forget if you don't do this move or you have trouble with struggle with impact. You feeling like you're doing what we're saying or anyone tells you to do is not enough because you don't know what it should feel like. Film yourself. Verify you're actually doing what you How many times have we gotten a comment? It's like, "Oh, I tried that at the range. It didn't work. >> You didn't do it." >> But did you film yourself? No, I'd made two swings. Didn't work. I Okay, >> that that we've taught enough lessons by now to know you ain't changing anything by trying a different intent, >> two balls. So, you've got to film it. Confirm what you're doing. >> Now, you're getting into the nitty-gritty and actually starting to change your swing. We've got correct information. You apply that over and over again, you start to see a swing change. But, film, film, film.
