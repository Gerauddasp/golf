[Putting drills header][images/header.png]

## Overview

Putting separates good scores from great scores. These five drills develop the critical skills needed for confident, consistent putting: distance control, stroke mechanics, precise aiming, lag putting, and aggressive pace.

## Drill 1: Clockwise 1-2-3 Putter Length Drill

**Purpose**: Develop distance control and break management at key scoring distances.

**Setup**:
- Position tees around holes at 1, 2, and 3 putter-lengths away
- Create stations at each distance

**Practice Routine**:
- Putt from each position moving clockwise around the hole
- Track makes at each distance
- Adjust for break from different angles

**Benefit**: Builds confidence and touch at the most important putting distances.

## Drill 2: Straight Back and Through Putting Stroke Drill

**Purpose**: Reduce unwanted arc in the putting stroke for more consistent roll.

**Setup**:
- Position two clubs parallel on either side of the ball
- Create a channel for the putter to travel through

**Key Focus**:
- Putter travels straight back and straight through
- Eliminates excessive inside or outside arc
- Promotes repeatable stroke path

**Benefit**: Fewer missed putts from poor stroke mechanics.

## Drill 3: Target the Very Center of the Cup Drill

**Purpose**: Improve aiming precision with sharper target selection.

**Setup**:
- Place a tee in the center of the cup
- Aim to hit the tee rather than just "the hole"

**Key Principle**: Training with a smaller, more precise target carries over to actual play

**Benefit**: Develops sharper visual focus and better aim on the course.

## Drill 4: Lag Putting Drill

**Purpose**: Emphasize pace control and three-putt prevention from long distances.

**Practice Goal**:
- Focus on stopping putts within three feet of the hole
- Prioritize pace over holing out
- Eliminate three-putt disasters

**Benefit**: Builds confidence on long putts and ensures easier second putts.

## Drill 5: Don't Leave It Short Putting Drill

**Purpose**: Build confidence with aggressive pace that gives putts a chance to fall.

**Practice Rule**:
- Putts that stop short incur penalty distances
- Reinforces getting the ball to the hole
- Builds aggressive mindset

**Key Principle**: "Never up, never in" - putts that don't reach have zero chance

**Benefit**: Eliminates tentative strokes and builds confident, aggressive putting.
