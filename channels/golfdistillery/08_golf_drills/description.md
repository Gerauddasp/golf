# Description

This page serves as the main landing page for Golf Distillery's comprehensive drill section.
It organizes golf practice exercises into eight distinct categories covering the full swing sequence.
Each category focuses on a specific phase: takeaway, backswing, top of swing, downswing, impact, and release.
The page also includes dedicated sections for short game skills: chipping and putting drills.
These practice routines are designed to be performed at home, on ranges, or practice areas with or without training aids.
