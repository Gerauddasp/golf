# Takeaway Drills - Summary

The takeaway is the first sequence of the golf swing after setup and address.
Two primary drills teach proper takeaway mechanics: the one-piece takeaway drill and the square takeaway drill.
The one-piece drill ensures shoulders, trunk, arms and wrists move together as a synchronized block.
The square takeaway drill uses a basket to train keeping the club path straight rather than too inside or outside.
Proper takeaway fundamentals prevent errors from compounding through the rest of the swing.
