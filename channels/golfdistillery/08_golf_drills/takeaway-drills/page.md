## Overview

The takeaway is the first sequence of the golf swing that occurs after addressing the ball at setup. Proper takeaway technique is crucial because errors during this phase can compound throughout the entire swing sequence through impact.

## Drill 1: One-Piece Takeaway Drill

**Purpose**: Train the synchronized movement of shoulders, trunk, arms, and wrists moving together as one block rather than using arms alone.

**Key Points**:
- Grip the club lower on the shaft
- Rotate the torso to move all components together
- The club butt should remain pointed at your belly during the takeaway
- Wrist hinging should begin only when hands reach hip height
- Avoid initiating wrist action too early in the takeaway

## Drill 2: Square Takeaway Drill

**Purpose**: Learn to bring the club straight back rather than too far inside or outside the target line.

**Setup**:
- Use a practice basket or bucket
- Hold it with hands on each side as you would a golf club
- Position at address as normal

**Execution**:
- Bring the basket back to hip height
- Check that the opening points directly away from the target
- This indicates a square takeaway path

**Common Errors Prevented**:
- Rolling hands inward (inside path)
- Pushing club outward (outside path/over-the-top error)
