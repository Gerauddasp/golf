# Downswing Drills - Summary

The downswing is the phase from the top of the swing through to impact with the ball.
Three drills focus on weight transfer, club path, and eliminating the over-the-top error.
The weight transfer drill ensures proper movement onto the front foot to avoid reverse pivot.
The correct path drill uses a tee in the grip to verify the club is traveling on the proper downswing path.
The anti over-the-top drill teaches dropping the right elbow to prevent outside-in swing paths.
