# Impact Drills - Summary

Impact is where the magic happens in the golf swing - the moment of truth for ball contact.
Three drills develop powerful and consistent impact positions through different training methods.
The snap left knee drill strengthens the left side and promotes proper hip rotation through impact.
The impact bag drill develops lag retention and proper weight transfer using a weighted training aid.
The static press drill builds strength and identifies optimal impact positioning through resistance training.
