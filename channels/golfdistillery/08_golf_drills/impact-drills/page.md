[Impact drills header][images/header.png]

## Overview

Impact is where the magic happens in the golf swing - the moment where all your preparation meets the ball. Developing a powerful, consistent impact position is essential for quality ball striking. Three drills train different aspects of proper impact mechanics.

## Drill 1: Snap your Left Knee Drill

**Purpose**: Strengthen the left side for more power in golf shots.

**Key Movements**:
- Bump hips forward during transition
- Straighten the left knee fully through impact
- Rotate hips and shoulders through the downswing

**Benefit**: Creates a strong left side "post" to swing against for maximum power transfer.

## Drill 2: Impact Bag Drill

**Purpose**: Develop powerful impact mechanics by practicing with a weighted training bag.

**Critical Focus Areas**:
- Maintain lag in wrists (avoid early flicking/release)
- Transfer weight onto front foot
- Prevent weight from staying on back foot

**Training Aid**: Requires an impact bag (weighted practice aid)

**Benefit**: Provides physical feedback for proper lag retention and weight transfer.

## Drill 3: Static Press Drill

**Purpose**: Build impact strength and identify optimal positioning through resistance.

**Setup**: Use a heavy object to press against

**Key Observations for Maximum Power**:
- Weight transfers to left foot
- Arms fully extend
- Wrists stay forward ahead of ball position

**Benefit**: Develops strength and body awareness for powerful impact positions.
