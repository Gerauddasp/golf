# Best Release & Extension Drills for your Golf Swing

[Release drills header][images/header.png]

## Overview

The release phase occurs immediately after impact as the club extends through the ball. Proper release mechanics involve active rotation of the arms and hands to square the clubface. Under-rotation is a common fault that causes slices and pushes.

## Drill 1: Proper Arm Rotation Drill

**Purpose**: Correct under-rotation of hands and arms near impact.

**Key Focus**:
- Right arm rolls aggressively over the left through impact
- Maintain active rotation through extension phase
- Prevent lazy arm action

**Common Errors Prevented**:
- Slices (from open clubface)
- Pushes (from blocked release)

**Benefit**: Trains proper forearm rotation for square clubface delivery.

## Drill 2: Proper Hand Rotation Drill

**Purpose**: Train hands and wrists to remain active through the release.

**Key Checkpoint**:
- Clubface becomes perpendicular to ground at impact
- Hands actively rotate (not passive)
- Wrists stay engaged through the ball

**Common Error Prevented**: Lazy hand action that leaves the clubface open at impact.

**Benefit**: Develops active hand release for consistent ball flight and direction.
