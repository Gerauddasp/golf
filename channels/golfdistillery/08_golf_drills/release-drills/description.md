# Release Drills - Summary

The release phase occurs immediately after impact as the club extends through the ball.
Two drills focus on proper arm and hand rotation to prevent slices and pushes.
The arm rotation drill trains the right arm to roll aggressively over the left through impact.
The hand rotation drill ensures hands and wrists remain active to square the clubface at impact.
Proper release mechanics prevent the common error of under-rotation that leaves the clubface open.
