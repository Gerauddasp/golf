## How to Line Up a Golf Shot

A consistent golf swing and consistent golf game can only be built on proper alignment. Many amateur golfers struggle with alignment for two main reasons:

1. They've adjusted their stance to compensate for swing faults (e.g., aiming left to accommodate a slice)
2. They fail to regularly check if they're maintaining proper alignment

## Testing Your Stance Alignment

**The Club Test:**
Place a golf club along your toes, step back, and observe where the club points relative to your target.

### Three Possible Results:

**Closed Stance:**

If the club points directly at the target, or to the right of the target, your stance is what we call closed.

**Open Stance:**

If the club points way left of the target, your stance is what we call open.

**Square Stance (CORRECT):**

The club should point parallel left of the target. Think of two train tracks - one line runs from your feet parallel to the target line, while the other runs from the ball to the target. These lines should be parallel.

## Full Body Alignment

Your knees, hips, and shoulders should all be aligned parallel to your feet.

**Verification Method:**
Have a friend hold a golf club across your hips and another across your shoulders while you're in your setup position. This helps verify proper body alignment.

## Clubface Alignment

The clubface itself must be square (at right angles) to the ball-to-target line.

Three clubface positions:
- Open (points right of target)
- Square (perpendicular to target line) ✓ CORRECT
- Closed (points left of target)

## Making Great Alignment Feel Like Second Nature

Four key practices to maintain proper alignment:

**1. Regular Range Checks**
Check the alignment of your feet, knees, hips, and shoulders regularly at the practice range. Use golf clubs or alignment sticks on the ground as visual references.

**2. Get Feedback**
Have someone observe your hip and shoulder alignment from behind during practice. These are difficult to self-assess without external feedback.

**3. Use Reference Points**
Identify a mark on your target line just a few feet ahead of the ball. Align your body parallel to this reference point as part of your setup routine.

**4. Daily Practice**
Practice identifying your alignment reference point and completing your pre-shot routine 3-5 times per day for 7-10 days. This builds consistency and makes proper alignment automatic.

## Expert Perspective

> "It goes without saying that it is no good having a perfect setup, perfect grip and perfect golf swing if the whole thing is misaligned. It sounds obvious but many players simply do not spend enough time getting themselves on target."
