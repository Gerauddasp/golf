## Overview

The backswing phase occurs after the takeaway and continues until reaching the top of the swing. Proper backswing mechanics ensure the club travels on the correct plane and arrives in an optimal position to start the downswing.

## Drill 1: Proper On-Plane Backswing Drill

**Purpose**: Evaluate whether the club travels back along the correct swing plane rather than too steep or too flat.

**Setup**:
- Stand with your back near a wall
- Make your backswing motion

**Checkpoint**:
- Note where the clubhead would contact the wall at the top
- Proper on-plane position: clubhead strikes around head height
- Below head height: swing plane is too flat
- Above head height: swing plane is too steep

**Benefits**: Identifies swing plane issues that affect consistency and ball flight.

## Drill 2: Proper Club Position Backswing Drill

**Purpose**: Verify correct hand and club positioning at the halfway-back checkpoint.

**Setup**:
- Separate hands on the shaft
- Take club back to halfway position

**Checkpoint at Chest Height**:
- Stop when lower hand reaches chest height
- Grip end should point toward the ball
- Hands should be behind the target-facing body plane
- Not excessively inside or outside

**Key Principle**: Achieving a square backswing path sets up proper positioning at the top.
