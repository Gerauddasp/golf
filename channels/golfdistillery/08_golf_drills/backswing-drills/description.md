# Backswing Drills - Summary

The backswing phase extends from the end of takeaway to the top of the swing.
Two drills focus on proper club path and positioning during the backswing.
The on-plane drill uses a wall to check if the club is traveling on the correct plane versus too steep or too flat.
The club position drill verifies that hands and club are properly positioned at the halfway-back checkpoint.
Correct backswing fundamentals ensure the club arrives in the optimal position at the top of the swing.
