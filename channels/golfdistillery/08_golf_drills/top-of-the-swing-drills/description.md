# Top of the Swing Drills - Summary

The top of the swing represents the critical transition point between backswing and downswing.
Four drills check key positions: upper body rotation, club position on-plane, club shaft direction, and right hand setup.
The rotation drill verifies proper shoulder turn while maintaining knee flex and stability.
The position and direction drills ensure the club is on-plane and properly aligned with the target.
The right hand drill establishes the correct hand position for initiating a powerful downswing sequence.
