# Best Top of the Swing Drills for your Golf Swing

## Overview

The top of the swing marks the critical transition point between the backswing and downswing. This position determines the quality of the entire downswing sequence and impact. Four key drills verify proper positioning at this crucial checkpoint.

## Drill 1: Proper Upper Body Rotation Drill

**Purpose**: Test rotational mechanics and shoulder turn quality.

**Setup**:
- Hold a club across shoulders parallel to ground
- Make backswing motion to top position

**Key Checkpoints**:
- Club should point toward the ball
- Knees remain flexed (not collapsed)
- Verify efficient upper body coiling
- Maintain knee stability throughout

## Drill 2: Proper Club Position at the Top Drill

**Purpose**: Assess whether swing plane is on-target.

**Execution**:
- Reach top of swing position
- Release wrists and let club shaft drop

**Position Analysis**:
- **On-plane**: Shaft touches shoulder bone
- **Too flat**: Shaft touches upper arm
- **Too upright**: Shaft touches neck

**Benefit**: Confirms on-plane positioning for consistent ball contact.

## Drill 3: Proper Club Direction at the Top Drill

**Purpose**: Verify club shaft alignment relative to target line.

**Checkpoint at Top**:
- **Square**: Shaft points at target (ideal)
- **Laid off**: Shaft points left of target
- **Across the line**: Shaft points right of target

**Key Insight**: Proper shaft direction indicates correct hand position and backswing mechanics.

## Drill 4: Proper Right Hand Position at the Top Drill

- Wrist bent at approximately 90 degrees
- Hand pointing skyward
- Elbow positioned below shoulder level

**Benefit**: Establishes strong position for impact sequence and power generation.
