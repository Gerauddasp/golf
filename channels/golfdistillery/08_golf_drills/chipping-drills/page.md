## Overview

Chipping is a critical scoring skill that can save strokes around the green. These five drills develop consistent strike, distance control, club selection, and technique mastery for reliable short game performance.

## Drill 1: Consistent Strike Chipping Drill

**Purpose**: Train hands to remain quiet during chip shots.

**Key Technique**:
- Focus on shoulder rotation rather than wrist movement
- Club shaft remains clear in front of you when executed correctly

**Error Detection**: If shaft strikes your side, indicates improper wrist breaking

**Benefit**: Develops consistent contact through body rotation instead of hand manipulation.

## Drill 2: Putt your Chip Drill
