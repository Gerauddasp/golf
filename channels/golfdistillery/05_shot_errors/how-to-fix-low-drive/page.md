# Low Drives – How to Stop Hitting Drives Too Low

Many golfers prefer a low ball flight with their driver. They believe that the ball rolling upon landing will provide some extra distance in their drives. This is unfortunate as better golfers – and Tour Pros – much prefer a higher ball flight that also produces some roll upon landing.

A high ball trajectory with your drives that sees the ball coming down at the perfect angle will provide a greater total distance – carry distance + roll distance – than a lower one.

Follow the tips below in order to fix your low drives and hit higher golf shots with your driver instead.

## Low Drives Cause #1: Low Strike Location

The first cause relates to clubface contact location. When you strike the ball towards the bottom of the clubface below the sweet spot, drives become lower than optimal. This occurs because the loft angle is smaller on the driver's bottom section than in the middle section.

Hitting low on the clubface may also indicate topping or thinning the ball, catching it above its equator, which produces an impure shot.

To diagnose this issue, use impact powder or decals on your club face to see where strikes land. If your tee height is relatively low, try raising it slightly to compare results.

## Low Drives Cause #2: Not Enough Loft

Sometimes low drives stem from driver specifications. Consider whether your driver's loft matches your swing speed. A driver with 8.5 degrees of loft naturally produces a lower trajectory than one with 13.5 degrees. Lower-lofted options suit faster swing speeds better.

A club fitting session helps pinpoint the optimal loft for your particular swing.

## Low Drives Cause #3: Shaft Too Stiff

Your shaft flex may be inappropriate for your driver speed. Generally, stiffer club shafts produce lower ball flights. While faster swingers benefit from stiffer shafts, this may not apply to you—especially if your swing speed cannot properly work with a stiff or extra stiff shaft.

## Low Drives Cause #4: Ball Position Too Far Back

Ball positioning affects trajectory significantly. A ball positioned too far back in your stance sends drives on lower trajectories because the club strikes the ball too early in your swing arc, where the clubface is de-lofted compared to its proper position.

With your driver, position the ball towards your front foot's instep.

## Low Drives Cause #5: Spine Angle Not Angled

Your setup and address also influence ball flight. With proper forward ball positioning, your body should be behind the ball. Correctly pointing your shaft toward your left hip means your body should tilt back somewhat.

This spine angle tilt characterizes the driver address position. Setting up with a straight upper body produces a descending swing arc and lower ball flight. Avoid positioning too much weight forward at address or impact.
