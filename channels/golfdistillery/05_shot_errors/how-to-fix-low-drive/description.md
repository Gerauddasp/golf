# Description: How to Fix Low Drive

This article explains why golfers hit drives on excessively low trajectories and provides five specific causes with solutions.
The main argument is that higher ball flights produce greater total distance than low drives, contrary to common belief.
The five causes covered are: strike location below the sweet spot, insufficient driver loft, shaft too stiff, ball position too far back, and improper spine angle at address.
Each cause includes a detailed explanation and practical fix, such as raising tee height, getting fitted for proper loft, checking shaft flex, positioning the ball at the front foot instep, and tilting the spine back at setup.
The article emphasizes that Tour professionals prefer higher trajectories because they optimize both carry and roll distance.
