## Directional Errors (Lateral Ball Flight)

### 1. Slice – How to Fix Slices

![Slice][images/slice.png]

A slice involves the ball starting left of target and curving right. The slice results from an outside-in club path with a clubface closed to target but open relative to the path.

![Slice Causes][images/slice-causes.png]

Common causes include open stance, outside-in swing, and weak grip.

### 2. Hook – How to Fix Hooks

![Hook][images/hook.png]

Hooks see the ball starting right and curving left aggressively. These stem from an inside-out path with a clubface open to target but closed to the path.

Contributing factors include closed stance, inside-out swing, and strong grip.

### 3. Push – How to Fix Pushes

![Push][images/push.png]

A push is a ball flight trajectory that sees the ball starting right of the target initially and continuing on that path in a straight line.

![Push Causes][images/push-causes.png]

Causes include inside-out club path with clubface open to target but square to path. Alignment right of target or inside-out swing with weak grip can produce pushes.

### 4. Pull – How to Fix Pulls

![Pull][images/pull.png]

A pull is a ball flight trajectory that sees the ball starting left of the target initially and continuing on that path in a straight line.

![Pull Causes][images/pull-causes.png]

These result from outside-in path with clubface closed to target but square to path. Misalignment left or outside-in swing with strong grip may cause pulls.

## Contact Errors (Vertical Ball Flight)

### 5. Fat – How to Fix Fat Shots

![Fat][images/fat.png]

A fat shot occurs when the clubhead penetrates the ground before it strikes the ball.

![Fat Causes][images/fat-causes.png]

The problem involves the swing's lowest point occurring too early and too low, ahead of the ball position.

---

### 6. Thin – How to Fix Thin Shots

![Thin][images/thin.png]

A thin shot occurs when the ball is struck below its equator by the leading edge of the clubhead.

![Thin Causes][images/thin-causes.png]

This happens when the swing's bottom point comes too soon or too high from the ground.

---

### 7. Top – How to Fix Topped Shots

![Top][images/top.png]

A topped shot occurs when the ball is struck above its equator by the leading edge of the clubhead.

![Top Causes][images/top-causes.png]

The swing's lowest point is positioned too high or occurs too soon before or too late after contact.

---

### 8. Sky – How to Fix Skied Shots

![Sky][images/sky-288.png]

A skied shot occurs when the ball is struck by the top edge – or crown – of the clubhead.

Ball strikes the crown rather than the sweet spot, sending it upward with minimal forward momentum.

---

### 9. Whiff – Whiffing the Ball

![Whiff][images/whiff.png]

A whiffed shot occurs when the clubhead fails to make contact with the ball despite an effort to do so.

![Whiff Root Cause][images/whiff-root-cause.png]

Despite missing the ball, the stroke counts under golf rules. The swing bottom is too high relative to ball position.

---

## Distance Errors

### 10. Overclub – Overclubbing a Shot

![Overclub][images/overclub-288.png]

An overclubbed shot occurs when the ball comes to rest well past the target.

Caused by misjudging distance and environmental factors, or hitting thin shots that travel too far.

---

### 11. Underclub – Underclubbing a Shot

![Underclub][images/underclub-288.png]

An underclubbed shot occurs when the ball lands and stops short of the target.

Results from poor club selection judgment or hitting fat shots that don't reach the intended distance.

## Driver-Specific Flight Errors

### 12. High Drives – How to Fix Driving the Ball Too High

![High Drive][images/driver-high-drive.png]

A high drive occurs when the ball flies too high into the sky with your driver.

Setup issues include tee positioned too high or ball too forward. Driver loft may be excessive or shaft overly flexible.

---

### 13. Low Drives – How to Fix Driving the Ball Too Low

![Low Drive][images/driver-low-drive.png]

A low drive occurs when the ball flies too low to the ground with your driver.

Problems include tee too low or ball positioned too far back. Driver loft may be insufficient or shaft too stiff.
