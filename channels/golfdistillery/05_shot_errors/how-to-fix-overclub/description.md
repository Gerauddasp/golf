# Description

This Golf Distillery page explains overclubbing - when a golfer selects a club that sends the ball beyond the target distance.

The guide identifies six lie conditions that lead to overclubbing: elevated positions above the green, tailwind conditions, rough lies that reduce backspin, draw/hook ball flights that produce extra roll, switching to harder balls during a round, and warmer temperatures that increase distance.

It also covers shot execution errors, specifically thin contact that creates lower trajectory and excessive rolling distance.

Each condition includes a practical fix to help golfers make better club selections and avoid overshooting their targets.
