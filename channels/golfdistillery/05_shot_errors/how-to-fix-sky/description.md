# How to Fix Sky Shots - Description

This page explains sky shots in golf, where the club's top edge contacts the ball near its bottom, sending it high with minimal forward distance.
The root cause across all scenarios involves the swing arc's lowest point being too low relative to the ball's position.
Four main causes are covered: tee height issues, balls sitting up in rough, hitting down with woods instead of up, and forward spine angle collapse.
Each cause includes visual diagrams showing the problem and specific corrective actions to eliminate sky shots.
Solutions range from simple setup adjustments (tee height, grip position) to swing mechanics corrections (ball position, spine angle maintenance).
