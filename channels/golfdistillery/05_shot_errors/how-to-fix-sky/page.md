## What is a Sky Shot?

In golf, a sky shot occurs when the clubhead hits the ball near its bottom pole, which sends the ball high into the air but not much forward.

## Root Cause of All Sky Shots

[What causes a sky? - Bottom of swing arc too low][images/sky-root-cause.png]

The fundamental issue common to all sky shots: the bottom of the swing arc will be too low relative to the position of the ball. This allows the top edge of the club to make contact with the lower portion of the ball.

## Cause #1: Ball Too High on a Tee

### The Problem
When the ball is positioned excessively high on the tee, it creates conditions where the club's top edge can contact the ball's underside.

### The Fix
Push the tee further down into the ground. Proper tee height should position the ball so that when the driver is placed next to it, the top edge of the clubface aligns with the ball's equator.

## Cause #2: Ball Sitting Up in the Rough

### The Problem
When the ball sits up in fluffy rough, it's elevated higher than normal, similar to being too high on a tee. The club can travel underneath the ball, causing sky contact.

### The Fix
Two solutions:
1. **Choke down on the club** - Gripping lower on the handle effectively raises the swing arc's lowest point
2. **Hover the club at address** - Rather than grounding the club behind the ball, hover it at the ball's equator level

## Cause #3: You're Hitting Down Instead of Up

### The Problem
With woods (especially drivers), you need to strike the ball on the upswing, not the downswing. A descending blow with woods leads to sky shots.

### The Fix
Two approaches:
1. **Move the ball forward in your stance** - Position it near your left foot's instep (for right-handed golfers)
2. **Flatten your swing plane** - Use a flatter, more sweeping motion rather than a steep, downward strike

## Cause #4: Falling Spine Angle

### The Problem
Bending your upper body forward during the downswing (toward the ball) increases the likelihood of sky shots, especially when the ball is elevated on a tee or sitting up.

### The Fix
Maintain a constant spine angle throughout the swing. Your upper body should rotate around your hips without bending forward toward the ball during the downswing.

## Summary

Sky shots result from the club's top edge contacting the ball's lower portion. The solutions depend on the specific cause:

- **Setup issues** (tee height, rough lies) → Adjust tee depth, choke down, or hover the club
- **Swing path issues** (hitting down) → Move ball forward, flatten swing plane
- **Body mechanics** (spine angle) → Maintain constant spine angle through impact
