## What is a Thin Shot?

A thin shot is one that sees the club hitting the ball below its equator. Instead of hitting the ball with the sweet spot of the clubface, the leading edge of the club makes contact with the ball instead.

This type of shot produces a ball that flies lower than it should and that will roll excessively. The feel of the shot will also be poor and can even hurt your hands in some instances. Finally, you'll notice little to no divot in the fairway or on the range where you hit the shot.

## Root Cause

[Causes of thin shots diagram][images/thin-causes.png]

In order to hit a golf shot successfully the bottom of the swing arc needs to be located behind the ball, or before contact with the ball is made.

If that bottom of the swing arc is instead located after the ball is struck or if the bottom of the swing is located too high then the leading edge of the club can make contact with the ball instead of the sweet spot, resulting in a thin shot.

## Swing Errors that Promote Thin Shots

### Standing Up at Impact

One of the most common reasons for thin shots involves the golfer rising before impact is made with the ball. Indeed, by standing up at impact the golfer is raising the bottom of his swing arc, making it more likely that the ball will be hit thin as a result.

**How to Fix:** Keep your head in the box. In order to promote solid contact and make sure the ball is hit with the sweet spot of the club make it a swing thought to keep your head at the same vertical distance from the ground at impact than it was at address.

### Swaying During the Swing

Swaying during the swing is another swing error that can lead to thin shots. In more details, swaying consists in allowing your hips to slide left and right laterally during the swing. As is the case with standing up, swaying moves the swing arc from where it was originally setup. And as a result, this can lead to thin shots.

**How to Fix:** Lean your right knee inward. In order to make sure your hips stay where they were setup at address make sure to keep your right knee leaned in slightly. It is also helpful to feel as though your right knee remains flexed throughout the backswing, and not straightened.

### Reverse Pivot

A reverse pivot consists in having the weight of your body moves towards the target during the backswing and then away from the target during the downswing. This is in contrast with the proper weight transfer that should see the weight moving first towards the back foot and then towards the front foot. The problem with a reverse pivot as it relates to thin shots has to do with the fact that the center of the swing arc is located too far forward and needs to be brought back in order to make solid contact.

**How to Fix:** Pivot towards your back foot. In order to promote solid ball striking it is crucial to transfer your weight towards your back foot during the backswing. This will happen naturally if you allow your left knee to break towards the ball during the backswing and if you allow your hips to turn back.

### Flipping / Scooping the Club

Flipping or scooping the club at impact is a swing error that occurs when the hands stop leading the clubhead through impact. In doing so, the hands allow the clubhead to catch up to them and to overtake them. One of the consequences of that swing error is that the bottom of the swing arc – which is located where the hands are – is brought back, or closer to the golfer. And if the bottom of the swing arc is brought back then thin shots can occur.

**How to Fix:** Don't release your wrist hinge. In order to keep your hands leading the club through the impact zone make it a swing thought to keep your wrists from releasing the angle they formed during the backswing. Keep that angle through impact and only let it go in the follow through.

### Inconsistent Spine Angle

The spine angle refers to the forward tilt of your upper body during the swing. In order to promote solid, consistent ball striking that spine angle should remain constant throughout the swing. Or in other words, your upper body should not move forward or backwards during the golf swing. Otherwise, you'll be moving around the swing arc and making solid contact difficult to achieve, resulting in both fat and thin shots.

**How to Fix:** Imagine your head is up against a wall. In order to keep your spine angle constant throughout the swing imagine your head is pressed up against a wall behind you and that you should keep it there from the top of the backswing through impact.

## Setup/Address Errors that Promote Thin Shots

### Ball Position is Too Far Forward

Having the ball positioned too far forward in your stance can promote thin shots. Indeed, because of the forward ball position you are virtually asking your body to reach for the ball in order to make contact with it. And the only way your body can do that is by raising the swing arc – through standing up – or by scooping at the ball. Both of those reactions can promote thin shots.

**How to Fix:** Adjust your ball position. In order to promote solid contact make sure your ball is positioned according to the club you have in your hands. For wedges, position the ball in the center of your stance and gradually move it forward as you move to longer irons and woods. For a driver – your longest club – position the ball on a line with the inside of your left foot.

### Your Stance is Too Narrow

A golf stance that features your feet very close to each other can raise the bottom of the swing arc and promote thin shots.

**How to Fix:** Widen your stance. In order to promote solid, ball-first contact widen your stance. However, make sure not to widen it too much or you risk hitting the ground before the ball.

### Too Much Weight on the Back Foot

Having too much weight resting on your back foot can move the bottom of the swing arc backwards, or closer to your back foot and further from your front foot. And while it will help to prevent fat shots it can greatly promote thin shots as the swing is now setup to make contact with the ball through the leading edge.

**How to Fix:** Distribute your weight equally. In order to make sure the bottom of your swing arc is positioned where it should be make sure your weight is distributed equally between your feet at address. Alternatively, you can also position the majority of your weight on your front foot at address and keep it there throughout the swing, which is a swing method championed by some.

### Shaft is Leaning Backwards

For most shots in golf the shaft should be leaning forward at address or in other words your hands should be in front of the club. If your hands are instead behind the clubhead you are moving the bottom of your swing arc backwards and are promoting thin (or topped) shots.

**How to Fix:** Lean your shaft forward. At address make sure your hands are in front of the clubhead and that your shaft is leaning towards the target, especially for iron shots.

### Not Enough Knee Bend

Not bending your knees enough at address can result in the bottom of the swing arc being located too high above the ball. And if that is the case you run the risk of hitting thin shots regularly.

**How to Fix:** Bend your knees more. Make sure you bend your knees at address and that you do not stand too tall over the ball. That said, also make sure not to overdo it. A little knee bend should be sufficient.

### Spine Angle is Too Upright

Standing too upright at address is another possible error that can promote thin shots. Indeed, by failing to tilt your upper body forward you are raising the bottom of your swing arc and are making it more likely that you'll hit thin shots as a result.

**How to Fix:** Tilt your upper body forward at address. Make sure you bend your upper body forward at address, or in other words don't stand to upright. Again, make sure not to overdo it as going too far can promote fat shots instead.

### Shoulders are Level to the Ground

Finally, shoulders that are level to the ground at address can promote thin shots. Indeed, for a regular golf shot – with the ball on the ground and not on a tee – your right hand is lower than your left on the grip. Because of that fact your right shoulder should also be lower than your left. But if your shoulders are instead level you are fighting that natural slope and you are promoting swing errors as a result, including thin shots.

**How to Fix:** Let your shoulders match your hands. Simply let your right shoulder be lower than your left at address, as your hands naturally suggest it should be.
