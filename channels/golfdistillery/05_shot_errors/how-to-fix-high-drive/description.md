# Description

This guide addresses hitting drives that fly too high, which can cost distance and be affected by wind. It covers six primary causes: high strike location on clubface, excessive loft, flexible shaft, ball position, weight distribution, and scooping motion. It recommends using a launch monitor to verify ball flight before making swing adjustments.
