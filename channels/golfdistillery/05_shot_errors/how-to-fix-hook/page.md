## What is a Hook?

A hook shot starts right of the target initially but veers aggressively left due to strong counterclockwise sidespin.

## Main Fixes

### Fix #1: Closed Stance

**Problem:** Feet aligned pointing right of target (closed stance)

**Solution:** Adjust to square stance with feet parallel to target line

---

### Fix #2: Grip Too Strong

**Problem:** Too many knuckles visible (strong grip)

**Solution:** Weaken grip by rotating hands to show fewer knuckles

### Fix #3: Inside-Out Club Path

**Problem:** Excessive inside-out swing path

**Solution:** Square takeaway with shaft pointing at or left of target when parallel to ground

## Additional Causes & Fixes

### Closed Clubface at Takeaway

### Bowed Left Wrist at Top

### Laid Off Shaft Position

Point shaft toward target at top, not behind you (laid off).

### Aggressive Hand Release

Control hand release through impact to prevent excessive clubface rotation.

### Locking Right Knee at Top

[Locking your right knee at the top of the swing can lead to a hook][images/right-knee-lock.png]

Maintain flex in right knee throughout backswing.

---

### Hitting Ball on Toe

[A ball hit on the toe of the clubface can lead to a hook][images/toe-hit.png]

Stand closer to ball to avoid toe contact, which imparts hook spin.

## Pull Hook

A pull hook starts left and curves further left, caused by similar mechanics but with open stance.
