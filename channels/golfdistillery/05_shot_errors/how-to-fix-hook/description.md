# Description: How to Fix a Hook

This page explains what causes hook shots in golf and provides fixes for this common ball flight error.
The primary causes are a closed stance, strong grip, and inside-out club path combined with a closed clubface.
Three main fixes address stance alignment, grip strength adjustment, and club path correction during takeaway.
Additional causes covered include wrist position, shaft plane, hand release, knee flex, and contact location.
The page also distinguishes between regular hooks and pull hooks, which start left and curve further left.
