## What is a Topped Shot?

In golf a topped shot is one that sees the club hitting the ball above its equator. Instead of hitting the ball with the sweet spot of the clubface, the club makes contact with the ball above its equator using the leading edge of the club instead.

This type of shot produces a ball that travels very low with minimal distance. The feel of the shot will also be poor. Finally, you will likely produce little to no divot in the fairway or on the range where you hit the shot.

## Root Causes

There are 3 main reasons that can explain a topped shot:

1. The bottom of the swing arc is too high
2. The bottom of the swing arc is located before the ball (too soon)
3. The bottom of the swing arc is located after the ball (too late)

Each of these will be explained in details below and a discussion of the potential causes will follow after that.

### Cause #1: Bottom of the Swing Arc is Too High

![Topping the ball cause #1 - Bottom of the swing arc too high][images/top-cause1-swing-arc-too-high.png]

In order to hit a golf shot successfully the bottom of the swing arc needs to be located at the same level or just a little below the ball.

For iron shots in particular, the bottom of the swing arc should even be located slightly below the level of the ground. This is because in contrast to a topped shot, a properly executed iron shot will see a divot produced that sits just below the level of the ground.

If the bottom of the swing arc is instead located too high and doesn't reach down to where the ball sits then the sweet spot of the club will not make contact with the ball cleanly and a topped shot can result.

### Cause #2: Bottom of the Swing Arc is Before the Ball (Too Soon)

![Topping the ball cause #2 - Bottom of the swing arc too early][images/top-cause2-swing-arc-too-soon.png]

The bottom of the swing arc also needs to be positioned correctly in relation to the location of the ball in your stance.

If the bottom of your swing is instead located behind the ball – or too soon in the sequence of the swing – then the club will be rising by the time contact with the ball is made. And if the club is rising then the leading edge of the club can make contact with the ball above the ball's equator, producing a topped shot.

### Cause #3: Bottom of the Swing Arc is After the Ball (Too Late)

Finally, the bottom of the swing arc can also be located too far forward, or after the ball in the sequence of the swing.

If that is the case then the club will not have descended down far enough by the time it makes contact with the ball and the leading edge will make contact with the ball above the ball's equator, producing a topped shot.

## Swing Errors that Promote Topped Shots

### Swaying During the Swing

![Swaying can lead to topping the ball][images/top-reason-swaying.png]

Swaying during the swing is a swing error that can lead to topped shots. In more details, swaying consists in allowing your hips to slide left and right laterally during the swing. As is the case with standing up, swaying moves the swing arc from where it was originally setup. And as a result, this can lead to topped shots.

**How to Fix:** Lean your right knee inward. In order to make sure your hips stay where they were setup at address make sure to keep your right knee leaned in slightly. It is also helpful to feel as though your right knee remains flexed throughout the backswing, and not straightened. Lean in your right knee to restrict your upper body from sliding back during the takeaway and backswing.

### Reverse Pivot

![A reverse pivot swing can lead to topping the ball][images/top-reason-reverse-pivot.png]

A reverse pivot consists in having the weight of your body moves towards the target during the backswing and then away from the target during the downswing. This is in contrast with the proper weight transfer that should see the weight moving first towards the back foot and then towards the front foot.

The problem with a reverse pivot as it relates to topped shots has to do with the fact that it can move the bottom of the swing arc behind the ball instead of seeing it located in front of the ball, where it should be.

**How to Fix:** Pivot towards your back foot. In order to promote solid ball striking it is crucial to transfer your weight towards your back foot during the backswing. This will happen naturally if you allow your left knee to break towards the ball during the backswing and if you allow your hips to turn back.

## Setup/Address Errors that Promote Topped Shots

### Ball Positioned Incorrectly

![Ball positioning errors can lead to topping the ball][images/top-reason-ball-position.png]

Having the ball positioned too far forward or too far back in your stance can promote topped shots. Indeed, an incorrect ball position will virtually create a mismatch between where the bottom of the swing arc is located and where the ball is positioned.

For example, if you position the ball too far back in your stance you will move the bottom of your swing arc too far forward, or in front of the ball. This corresponds to cause #3 mentioned above.

Similarly, if you position the ball too far forward in your stance you will move the bottom of your swing arc behind the ball, or too soon in the swing sequence. This corresponds to cause #2 mentioned above.

**How to Fix:** Adjust your ball position. Favor positioning the ball in the center of your stance if you suspect the ball positioning could help explain your topping balls issues. From there, gradually move your ball forward or back in order to dial in the appropriate ball position for each club.

### Weight is Incorrectly Distributed at Address

![Incorrect weight distribution can lead to topping the ball][images/top-reason-weight-position.png]

Having too much weight resting on your front foot at address can move the bottom of the swing arc backwards, or behind the ball in the sequence of the swing. This corresponds to cause #2 mentioned above.

Similarly, having too much weight resting on your back foot at address can move the bottom of the swing arc forward, or in front of the ball. This corresponds to cause #3 mentioned above.

**How to Fix:** Distribute your weight equally. In order to make sure the bottom of your swing arc is positioned where it should be make sure your weight is distributed equally between your feet at address.

### Holding the Club Too Low on the Grip

![Holding the club too low on the grip can lead to topping the ball][images/top-reason-holding-grip-too-low.png]

Holding your golf club too low on the grip – also referred to as choking down – can result in the bottom of the swing arc being located too high above the ball. And if that is the case you run the risk of hitting topped shots regularly. This corresponds to cause #1 mentioned above.

Additionally, for golfers who are particularly tall, using golf clubs that are too short can lead to the same issue. Indeed, clubs that are too short will see the bottom of the swing arc located too high, away from the ball.

**How to Fix:** Hold your club higher on the grip. Don't choke down too much on the grip at address. Additionally, if you are particularly tall you may benefit from having your clubs fitted with longer shafts.

### Shoulders are Level to the Ground at Address

![Level shoulders at address can lead to topping the ball][images/top-reason-shoulders-level.png]

Finally, shoulders that are level to the ground at address can promote topped shots. Indeed, for a regular golf shot – with the ball on the ground and not on a tee – your right hand is lower than your left on the grip. Because of that fact your right shoulder should also be lower than your left.

But if your shoulders are instead level you are moving the bottom of the swing arc in front of the ball. This corresponds to cause #3 mentioned above.

**How to Fix:** Let your shoulders match your hands. Simply let your right shoulder be lower than your left at address, as your hands naturally suggest it should be.

## Summary

To eliminate topped shots:

1. **Swing Arc Height** - Ensure the bottom of your swing reaches down to or slightly below ball level
2. **Swing Arc Position** - Position the arc bottom at the correct location relative to the ball
3. **Avoid Swaying** - Keep right knee leaned in, maintain flexed throughout backswing
4. **Fix Reverse Pivot** - Transfer weight to back foot during backswing, front foot during downswing
5. **Ball Position** - Center the ball in your stance, adjust from there for each club
6. **Weight Distribution** - Distribute weight equally between both feet at address
7. **Grip Position** - Don't choke down excessively; tall golfers may need longer shafts
8. **Shoulder Slope** - Allow right shoulder to sit naturally lower than left at address
