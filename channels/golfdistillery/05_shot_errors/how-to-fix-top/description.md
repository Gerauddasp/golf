# Description

This page explains topped shots, where the club strikes above the ball's equator causing low, short shots with no divot.
The article identifies three root causes: swing arc too high, swing arc bottoming too early, or swing arc bottoming too late.
Common swing errors include swaying and reverse pivot, which misposition the swing arc relative to the ball.
Setup issues covered include incorrect ball position, poor weight distribution, choking down too much, and level shoulders at address.
Each problem is paired with specific fixes to help golfers eliminate topped shots and achieve solid contact.
