# Push Shots – How to Stop Pushing Golf Balls Right

[Push - Pushed shot - Pushing the ball][images/push.png]

In golf a push – or a pushed shot – is one that sees the ball starting right of the target initially and continuing on straight that line, without lateral spin.

## What Causes a Push?

### Clubface Open at Impact, But Square to the Club Path

For a push to occur – like in the case of a pull – the clubface must be square to the club path at impact. Or put differently, the path the club takes must match the direction of the clubface at impact.

Since the ball is heading right of the target, it can be understood that the clubface was likely open at impact and that the swing path was similarly pointing right of the target as well.

## Likely Reason #1: Are You Aligned Right of the Target?

As was the case with pulled shots, a push is a straight shot but one that misses the target to the right. But if you were not careful in aiming at the target while setting up and were instead aiming right, solving your issues becomes very easy.

### PUSH FIX #1: See to it that you aim correctly and adopt a square stance instead of a closed stance

Make sure your clubface is aiming exactly at the target and that your body and feet are aligned in a parallel manner to that line, resulting in a square stance.

## Likely Reason #2: Inside-Out Swing and Weak Grip?

A weak grip promotes a lazy release of the club which translates into an open clubface at impact.

And if you are taking your club back slightly to the inside you are setting yourself up for more issues. Indeed this slightly inside takeaway will promote a swing that has an inside-out club path that will see the club travel from inside the target line, into impact and continuing towards the outside of the target line after impact.

And if we recall, a push shot will see both the swing path and clubface be slightly open at impact. It should be no surprise then that a weak grip coupled with a swing that sees the club taken slightly inside initially will promote pushed golf shots.

### PUSH FIX #2: Take the club back square (not inside) and strengthen your grip a little

Firstly, you should try to modify the path your club is taking during your swing. Ideally you should aim to transform your inside-out swing path into one that is inside-square-inside.

You should also consider strengthening your grip a little, or even a lot. If you can only see one knuckle (or less) on your left hand at address you have what is known as a weak grip. Rotating your hands clockwise on the handle should help you see two or even three knuckles instead and that will help you square the clubface at impact.

### PUSH FIX #3: Aim to the left of the target (instead)

[Aim left to compensate for pushes][images/push-fix2-aim-left.png]

If you are not ready to commit to modifying your swing or your golf swing's fundamentals – which takes time and effort – you can instead simply adjust your aim at setup.

That is, you could simply begin to aim to the left of the target, accepting that the ball will naturally miss the target to the right and instead aiming in order to compensate for it.

Indeed you may prefer to simply play with the swing you have and adjust your aim accordingly. This is particularly true if you only push your golf shots with a few of your clubs, such as your wedges for instance.

## Related Golf Swing Errors

### Blocking Shots can Lead to a Push

[Blocking a shot can lead to a push][images/push-reason-blocking.png]

Blocking – or in other words not finishing the swing or staying committed to it – leaves the body and clubface open to the target at impact.

And since a push happens when the clubface is open to the target, blocking can be a cause for pushed golf shots.

### Locking your Right Knee in the Backswing

[Locking right knee at top can cause pushes][images/push-reason-locking-right-knee.png]

If you are locking your right knee by straightening your right leg at the top of your backswing instead of keeping a slight bend in it, it could promote an inside-out swing path that will in turn promote pushed shots.

### Holding on to the Club Too Tightly

[Excessive grip pressure restricts release][images/push-reason-grip-pressure.png]

Holding on to your club too tightly with your hands can restrict the release of the clubface at impact, leaving it open to the target.

A lighter grip pressure and especially from the right hand can help make sure you release the club naturally through the hitting zone.

## Other Possible Reasons

### Ball Positioned Too Far Back in Your Stance

[Ball too far back in stance causes pushes][images/push-reason-ball-too-back.png]

Having the ball too far back in your stance can lead to all sorts of issues, among which a push is a possibility. Normally, if the ball is too far back in your stance you would catch the ball before your clubface has had time to rotate back into its normal position, which results in an open clubface and a shot that misses right of the target.

### Standing Too Tall / Too Little Knee Flex / Using Clubs with Lie Angles that are Too Flat

[Clubhead on toe from flat clubs causes pushes][images/push-reason-club-lie.png]

If you are standing too tall or are not bending your knees enough at address the lie angle of your club could be too flat in relation to the ground, causing the toe of the club to hit the ground at impact. This will twist the clubface open and can leave it open when it meets the ball at impact.

A similar fate can result from using clubs that have a lie angle that is too flat for you, based on your height and on your arm length.

### Ball Below Your Feet (Sidehill Lie)

[Ball below feet naturally leaves clubface open][images/push-reason-lie.png]

Finally, if the ball is below your feet – which happens when you are hitting uphill – the clubface will naturally want to return open at impact. It is therefore natural that such a lie will promote a push and you should aim left of your target whenever you face such a lie.

### Using Grips that are Too Big

[Oversized grips restrict clubface release][images/push-reason-grip-too-big.png]

Using grips that are too big for you in relation to the size of your hands can restrict the release of your hands during the swing. And since a poor release of the hands – and clubface – can lead to pushes, you may want to install grips with a smaller diameter.
