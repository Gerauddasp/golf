# How to Fix Fat Shots - Description

This page provides a comprehensive guide to diagnosing and correcting fat shots in golf.
Fat shots occur when the club hits the ground before the ball, causing significant distance loss.
The guide covers two main categories: swing errors (swaying, spine angle issues) and setup errors (ball position, stance width, weight distribution, and seven other common mistakes).
Each problem is illustrated with a diagram and includes specific corrective actions.
The systematic approach helps golfers identify their specific issue and apply the appropriate fix to eliminate fat shots.
