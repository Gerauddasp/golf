## What is a Fat Shot?

A fat shot is a shot that sees the club penetrating the ground before making contact with the ball.

It differs from a normal, proper shot in which the club will make contact with the ball first and where the club will penetrate the ground after, if at all.

Most significantly, a fat shot will see a notable reduction in the distance travelled by the ball. This is explained by the fact that the club will be slowed down considerably by the ground it hits before making contact with the ball.

## What causes fat shots?

[What causes fat shots? - Bottom of the swing arc too early and/or too low][images/fat-causes.png]

At the root of it, fat shots are caused by the bottom of your swing arc being located behind the ball at impact instead of slightly in front of it, towards the target. Or, they can also be caused by the bottom of your swing arc being too low into the ground altogether.

Indeed, if your swing arc reaches its lowest point after the ball and slightly into the ground, as it should, then the ball will be struck first.

But if the swing arc is too far behind, or if it is positioned too low into the ground then you'll be striking the ground before the ball and will experience a fat shot.

## Swing Errors that Can Lead to Fat Shots

### Are you swaying?

[Swaying can lead to a fat shot][images/fat-reason-swaying.png]

Swaying, or moving your hips laterally during your backswing will promote a situation in which the lowest point of your swing arc will be located behind the ball.

**How to fix it:** Rotate your upper body on top of your hips without moving your hips laterally.

### Are you failing to maintain your spine angle?

[Failing to keep your spine angle constant can lead to a fat shot][images/fat-reason-failing-spine-angle.png]

Moving your upper body excessively forward as you are hitting the ball – or failing to maintain a constant spine angle from address to impact – will see the bottom of your swing arc shift downwards more than it should. This will promote the club hitting the ground before it reaches the ball.

**How to fix it:** Keep your spine angle constant from address to impact.

## Address / Setup Errors that Can Lead to Fat Shots

### Is the ball too far forward in your stance?

[Positioning the ball too much forward in your stance can lead to a fat shot][images/fat-reason-ball-too-forward.png]

Positioning the ball too far towards the target at address makes it easier for the ball to be located past the bottom of your swing arc, which is conducive to fat shots.

**How to fix it:** Try centering the ball in your stance for wedges and short irons and move it progressively forward as you move to the longer clubs.

### Is your stance too wide?

[A stance that is too wide can lead to a fat shot][images/fat-reason-stance-too-wide.png]

A stance that is too wide will effectively see the distance from your hands to the ground reduced as your upper body is brought closer to the ground through your wider stance.

**How to fix it:** Try positioning your feet so that the outside of your shoulders are in line with the center of your feet.

### Is your weight mostly on your right foot (for a right-handed golfer)?

[Seeing your weight distributed mostly on your right foot can lead to a fat shot][images/fat-reason-weight-back.png]

Seeing too much weight distributed on your back foot at address promotes a situation in which your swing arc will reach its lowest point behind the ball, which is conducive to fat shots.

**How to fix it:** Distribute your weight evenly at address.

### Is your shaft leaning too much forward?

[A too aggressive shaft lean at address can lead to a fat shot][images/fat-reason-too-much-shaft-lean.png]

A shaft that is overly leaning forward at address will promote a situation in which the club will dig too aggressively into the ground.

**How to fix it:** Lean your shaft ever slightly forward but make sure not to overdo it.

### Are you holding your club too high on the grip?

[Holding the club too high on the grip can lead to a fat shot][images/fat-reason-holding-grip-too-high.png]

Holding your club higher than you should on the grip will result in the club itself being longer for the purpose of the shot than it should be. The natural consequence will see the risk of the club hitting the ground increase.

**How to fix it:** Try gripping down on your club.

### Are your feet dug too deep into the sand?

[Digging your feet too deep into the sand can lead to a fat shot][images/fat-reason-feet-dug-too-low.png]

Seeing your feet dug too low into the sand for bunker shots will bring the lowest point of your swing arc down too low as well, which is conducive to fat shots.

**How to fix it:** Try digging your feet into the sand so that they sink to a depth that corresponds to the depth at which the ball sits in the sand.

### Are your knees bent too much?

[Knees that are bent too much can lead to a fat shot][images/fat-reason-knee-bent-too-low.png]

Knees that are bent excessively can lead to a situation in which the distance from your hands to the ground is shortened, which can make striking the ground first easier. Additionally, excessive knee bend can lead to problems in keeping your knee flex constant throughout your swing, which can lead to inconsistent shots, fat shots being one of them.

**How to fix it:** Try bending your knees moderately and make sure to keep them flexed to a constant amount from address to impact.

### Is your spine angle bending you forward too much?

[A spine angle that bends the upper body forward too much can lead to a fat shot][images/fat-reason-spine-too-low.png]

A spine that is leaning forward excessively will bring your upper body down closer to the ground and the result will see the distance from your hands to the ground shortened, which can promote fat shots.

**How to fix it:** Try standing a little taller by reducing the angle at which you are bending your spine forward.

### Are your shoulders too slopped?

[Shoulders that are too slopped can lead to a fat shot][images/fat-reason-shoulders-too-slopped.png]

Shoulders that are tilted excessively at address in order to reach the ball can promote fat shots.

**How to fix it:** Try adjusting the slop of your shoulders so that your hands are comfortably reaching the ball.
