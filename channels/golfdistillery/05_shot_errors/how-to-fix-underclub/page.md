# Underclub – How to Stop Hitting Balls Short

[Main illustration showing underclub concept][images/underclub.png]

## Definition

In golf underclubbing occurs when a golfer uses a club that produces a shot where the ball lands short of the target.

## Overview

Every golf club has a specific loft and shaft length combination that sends the ball over a given distance. A golfer who is said to have underclubbed will have chosen a club that produces a shot distance that is smaller than the distance to the green – or the target. And because the ball will ultimately miss the target, coming to rest short, it is considered a golf shot error that should be avoided.

## Lie Conditions Leading to Underclubbing

### Is the green located above you?

Underclubbing can occur when the green is located much higher than where the ball lies. This happens regularly in mountain courses but also elsewhere when golf architects deal with hills or slopes. The ball won't be in the air as long when the green is elevated, resulting in shorter distance.

**Fix:** Club up when the green is located way above you. Some situations require a full club adjustment while others need slight swing tweaks. Experience guides proper judgment calls.

### Is the wind blowing hard?

Wind direction and strength can lead to club selection errors. A strong headwind can cost at least a full club's distance. Strong crosswinds also restrict ball travel distance.

**Fix:** Club up when against strong headwind and when facing strong crosswind. A wind speed costing a full club length head-on should cost half a club sideways.

### Is the ball buried deep into the rough?

Grass length impacts shot distance significantly. A ball buried in heavy rough or fescue will be slower due to grass blade resistance on the clubhead during the swing.

**Fix:** Position the ball back in your stance to reduce grass blade interference. In very tall grass, using high-lofted clubs like wedges to escape trouble is often best, accepting considerable distance loss.

### Do you change balls during a round?

Softer balls travel shorter distances than harder balls. Changing ball types mid-round without accounting for differences leads to underclubbing.

**Fix:** Don't change ball types during a round, or account for differences when selecting clubs.

### Is it cold outside?

Balls travel shorter distances in colder environments than warmer ones. Temperature swings during a round can affect distance.

**Fix:** Club up when it is particularly cold outside.

## Shot Errors Leading to Underclubbing

### Did you hit it fat?

Hitting the ball fat results in the clubhead slowing down as it digs before impact, reducing ball distance and leaving shots short of target.

**Fix:** Focus on getting clean contact with the ball.
