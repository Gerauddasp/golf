# How to Fix Pull Shots - Description

This comprehensive guide explains pull shots - straight shots that miss left of the target without curve - and their root causes involving a clubface square to an outside-in swing path.
The page systematically addresses solutions starting with alignment checks, then swing path corrections (from outside-in to in-square-in), grip adjustments (weakening from strong to neutral), and compensatory aiming strategies.
Advanced sections cover secondary contributing factors including over-the-top swings, locked left knee at impact, forward ball position, upright club lies, sidehill lies with ball above feet, and undersized grips.
Each cause is accompanied by detailed explanations and specific fixes, with 11 instructional diagrams illustrating the mechanics and corrections for each scenario.
The guide provides both permanent swing fixes for long-term improvement and quick compensatory adjustments for immediate on-course application.
