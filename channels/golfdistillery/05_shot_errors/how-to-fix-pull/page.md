# Pull Shots – How to Stop Pulling Golf Balls Left

## What is a Pull in Golf?

[Pull - Pulled shot - Pulling the ball][images/pull.png]

A pull – or a 'pulled shot' – is a straight shot that misses left of the target (for a right-handed golfer). The ball will not curve in the air as it follows a straight line left of where you aimed. In other words, a ball that is pulled will start left of the target initially and continue on straight that line, without lateral spin.

## What Causes a Pull?

[What causes a pull? - Outside-in club path & clubface closed][images/pull-causes.png]

In order for a pull to occur, the clubface must hit the ball while it is square to the club path. And in order for the ball to travel left, the club path itself must be traveling left of the target at impact.

More specifically, for the ball to travel left of the target, the club path must be on an outside-in swing path, one where the clubhead is traveling left of the target during the moment of impact with the ball.

Below are presented the most common reasons behind the occurrence of pull shots. More reasons are also presented later in this article.

### Reason #1: You Are Aligned Left of Your Target

[Reason for pull #1 - Aligned left of target][images/pull-reason1-alignment.png]

The first thing to verify before looking at any other possible reason is to confirm that you are aiming at your target correctly. Indeed, if you are instead setting up for a shot while aimed left of your target then you can probably expect the ball to travel in that direction as well.

**How to Fix This**

Make sure you adopt a square stance and that you are aiming at your target correctly.

### Reason #2: You Bring the Club Outside (or too much to the Inside) during the Backswing

[Reason for pull #2 - Outside-In path and strong grip][images/pull-reason2-pathgrip.png]

Even with a correct alignment set at address, the ball can still fly left of the target if your club travels on an outside-in club path. And that club path can easily result from a club that is taken back outside of the ideal swing plane during the takeaway and backswing.

Making matters worse, a pull shot will not only result from a bad takeaway and backswing but also from using a strong grip. Indeed, a strong grip is characterized by the ability to see 3 knuckles or more on your left hand (for a right-handed golfer) when you look down at your hands when addressing the ball.

That grip type has the unintended consequence of promoting an active release of the club through the hitting area, which in turn promotes a clubface that is closed at impact. As was seen earlier, a clubface that is closed at impact combined with an outside-in club path is the perfect recipe for a pulled shot.

**How to Fix This**

In order to fix this issue, you should first see to correct your swing path and turn it from an outside-in club path to an in-square-in club path instead. This process can be initiated by making sure the club travels square during the takeaway instead of outside the line.

See the impact a good vs bad takeaway can have on the rest of your swing in Swing Tips.

Finally, you should also look at weakening your grip so that at address, you can only see 2 knuckles from your left hand, or possibly only 1. This will prevent the club from closing too early through the release of the club, and should help keep your ball from flying left of the target.

### Fix #2: Aim to the Right of Your Target

While the first fix explained in detail how you can fix the root cause of your pull shot, it is also completely possible to compensate for the issue and just aim to the right of your target. This will have the net effect of sending your ball at your actual target even if your swing – and resulting ball flight – hasn't changed.

This is a solution that is particularly useful if you are in the middle of a round and are seeing your shots fly left constantly. Of course, once the round is over you should look at fixing your swing instead so you won't have to use this trick going forward.

## Other Reasons You Might Be Pulling the Ball

### Your Swing is Coming 'Over the Top'

Another swing error that can cause pull shots is one where the clubhead is located outside the target line during the downswing. This swing error is known as the "Over the Top" swing error and you can read about ways to fix it at Over the Top.

### You are Locking your Left Knee at Impact

Another error that can promote an outside-in swing path is one where you lock your left knee right at impact or during the release of the club. Instead, you should aim to keep your left knee angle constant (or to even increase it) through the swing and until the ball is long gone towards the target.

See more information on this swing error at Locking your Left Knee at Impact.

### Your Ball Position is Too Far Forward

While it is generally true that the ball should be located near your left heel for shots using woods – it should be located near the middle of your stance for shorter clubs – and at the 3 balls position for middle irons; it is possible for your ball position to be located too far forward.

When that is the case, you'll be hitting your ball during the release of the club, which is when your club path is going from in-square to in, or to the left of the target. In order to fix that issue, simply move your ball back a ball or two in your stance.

### Your Clubs are Too Upright at Address, or You Are Standing Too Low

[Club resting on heel][images/pull-reason-club-lie.png]

If the lie of your club is too upright – or if your posture is putting your club in a lie that is too upright at address – you can expect the ball to fly left at impact. This is because that particular setup promotes an impact that favors the heel portion of the clubface, which in turn promotes a pull.

You can correct this issue either by getting your clubs fitted correctly, or by making sure your posture doesn't put your clubs at address on their heels (as if only the heel was resting on the ground).

### Your Ball is Located Above Your Feet (Sidehill)

[Ball above feet lie situation][images/pull-reason-lie.png]

Situations that see the ball resting above your feet will naturally promote a ball flight that travels to the left, or pulls. It can be tricky to hit a shot from such a lie, but the general recommendation is to simply aim to the right of the target. Doing so will compensate for the pull and will send the ball on a line closer to your target.

### Your Grips are Too Small

[Grips too small causing pull][images/pull-reason-grip-too-small.png]

Finally, grips that are too small can promote an active release of your hands through the hitting area. This in turn can promote a clubface that is closed at impact, which can be one of the two ingredients necessary for a pulled shot.

You can fix this by ordering clubs that feature a larger diameter for the club grips. Or you can see to adding a layer or two of tape below the grips that are currently on your clubs.
