# Shot Errors - Description

This page provides illustrated guides for 13 common golf shot errors organized into four categories: directional errors (slice, hook, push, pull), contact errors (fat, thin, top, sky, whiff), distance errors (overclub, underclub), and driver-specific flight errors (high drive, low drive).

Each shot error includes visual diagrams showing the ball flight pattern, cause diagrams illustrating club path and clubface angles, and brief explanations of the root causes.

The guides emphasize understanding the relationship between club path, clubface angle, and swing arc position to help golfers identify which specific error they're experiencing.

This is an overview page that introduces each error type with links to more detailed fix guides on individual pages.

The visual approach makes it easy to quickly identify shot patterns and understand the fundamental mechanics causing each type of error.
