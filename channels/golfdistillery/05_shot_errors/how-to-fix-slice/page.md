# How to Fix a Slice

## What is a Slice?

A slice is a shot error where the ball starts its flight to the left of the target initially but then curves aggressively to the right. This shot results from clockwise sidespin applied to the ball.

## Root Causes

A slice requires three simultaneous conditions at impact:

1. **Outside-in club path** - The club approaches the ball from across the target line, moving from outside to inside
2. **Clubface open relative to the path** - The clubface points to the right of the swing direction
3. **Clubface closed relative to target** - Despite being open to the path, the face aims left of the target at impact

## Top 3 Fixes

### Fix #1: Correct Your Stance

An open stance (feet aligned left of target) is a common culprit. The solution is to adopt a square stance where your feet are parallel to the target line.

### Fix #2: Strengthen Your Grip

A weak grip promotes a lazy release of the hands through impact, leaving the clubface open. Strengthen your grip by rotating both hands so you can see two knuckles (neutral grip) or three knuckles (strong grip) on your left hand at address.

### Fix #3: Fix Your Club Path

Ensure your takeaway is square rather than outside the target line. Avoid the "over the top" move where your hands push away from your body during the downswing transition.

## Additional Contributing Factors

### Cupped Left Wrist at Top

A cupped left wrist at the top of the backswing promotes an open clubface at impact. Keep the wrist flat instead.

### Shaft "Across the Line"

When the shaft points right of the target at the top of the swing, it tends to produce an outside-in path on the downswing.

### Weak Release Through Impact

If the right hand fails to rotate naturally over the left through impact, the clubface will remain open. Check that your follow-through position shows proper rotation.

### Excessive Grip Pressure

Gripping the club too tightly restricts the natural release of the club through impact, leaving the face open.

### Locking the Left Knee

Locking your left knee through impact can push your hips forward and out of position, contributing to an outside-in path.

### Heel Strikes

Striking the ball on the heel of the club creates a gear effect that imparts clockwise sidespin, even with a square path and face.

## Push Slice Variation

A push slice is similar to a regular slice in that it features the same left-to-right sidespin. The key difference is that a push slice starts to the right of the target instead of to the left.

The causes remain identical - the only difference is that both the stance and clubface aim have rotated clockwise compared to a standard slice.

## Summary

To eliminate a slice:

1. **Stance** - Align feet parallel to target line (square stance)
2. **Grip** - Strengthen to see 2-3 knuckles on left hand
3. **Club Path** - Take club back square, avoid over-the-top move
4. **Release** - Allow natural rotation of hands through impact
5. **Contact** - Strike center of clubface, not the heel
6. **Pressure** - Grip gently to allow proper release
7. **Body Position** - Maintain proper knee flex and hip position
