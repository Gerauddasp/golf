# Description

This page explains how to fix a slice in golf, where the ball curves aggressively to the right due to clockwise sidespin.
The three primary fixes are: correcting stance alignment to square, strengthening grip to show 2-3 knuckles, and fixing club path to inside-square-inside.
Additional contributing factors include cupped wrist at top of swing, shaft across the line, weak release, excessive grip pressure, and heel strikes.
The page distinguishes between a standard slice (starts left, curves right) and a push slice (starts right, curves more right).
Contains 13 instructional diagrams illustrating each cause and fix for the slice shot error.
