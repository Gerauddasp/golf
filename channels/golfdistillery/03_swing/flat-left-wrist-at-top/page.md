# Flat Left Wrist at Top of Swing

## Understanding Wrist Positions

[Left wrist positions - flat vs cupped vs bowed][images/top-left-wrist.png]

At the top of the swing your wrist should be fully hinged. But more importantly, it should be hinged correctly.

### The Ideal Position: Flat Wrist

Ideally, the **top of your left hand** should line up with the rest of your forearm and upper arm. This describes what a "flat" wrist position looks like - creating a straight line from the hand through the forearm.

### What to Avoid

**Bowed Wrist:**
A bowed left hand does not line up with the forearm but rather breaks towards the ground, as if the club was too heavy. This incorrect position can affect both clubface alignment and swing plane.

**Cupped Wrist:**
A cupped wrist is the opposite and will see the top of the left hand curl up rather than maintaining the neutral flat position.

## Benefits of Proper Wrist Position

Correctly hinging your wrists **promotes a straight ball flight**. It does so because the wrists are positioned as they should and are not ultimately exerting sidespin onto the ball.

## Special Considerations for Slicers

For golfers dealing with slice problems, an undesirable position will see your left wrist angled up in what is referred to a **cupped position**. You are better off **avoiding this wrist position** if you are having slicing issues because the unwinding process from that position tends to leave the clubface open at impact.

Instead, you will want to see that left hand **flat** instead of bent up at the wrist.
