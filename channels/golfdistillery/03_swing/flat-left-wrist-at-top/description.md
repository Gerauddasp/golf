# Flat Left Wrist at Top - Summary

At the top of the swing, the left wrist should be fully hinged with the top of the left hand lined up with the forearm and upper arm in a flat position. This neutral position avoids two common errors: a bowed wrist (breaking toward the ground) and a cupped wrist (curling upward). Correctly hinging your wrists promotes a straight ball flight by preventing unwanted sidespin on the ball. Golfers who struggle with slicing should especially avoid a cupped wrist position, as this tends to leave the clubface open at impact.
