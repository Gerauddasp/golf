# Square Takeaway - Club Position During the Takeaway

## Overview

One of the first decisions you will make when beginning your golf swing is where to take the club back during the takeaway.

## Three Club Path Options

### Inside Takeaway (Incorrect for Straight Shots)

Bringing the club in involves bringing the clubhead towards your body as you execute the takeaway. When the shaft becomes parallel to the ground, it points right of the target. This path produces draw or hook spin, making it unsuitable for straight shots.

### Outside Takeaway (Incorrect for Straight Shots)

This method moves the clubhead away from your body. The shaft points left of the target when parallel to the ground. An outside-in swing path promotes a left-to-right sidespin associated with a fade or a slice. This should be avoided for straight shots.

### Square Takeaway (Recommended)

A square takeaway sees the shaft of the club pointing at the target. This recommended approach aligns the clubhead with the target line. This path promotes a square-inside-square club path that is associated with straight shots.

## Key Benefits

Taking the club back squarely puts it in the correct position for an inside-square-inside swing path. A square takeaway position promotes a straight ball flight that doesn't feature much in the way of sidespin. In simple terms, a square takeaway sees the shaft of the club pointing at the target. Using such a path will promote a square-inside-square club path that is associated with straight shots that feature minimal side spin.

## Visual Checkpoint

If you were to position a camera or a mirror directly behind the ball, in line with the target, a square takeaway would see your hands blocking the view of your clubhead when the shaft of the club is parallel to the ground. The end of the grip of the club should be shooting straight forward when the shaft of the club is parallel to the ground.

## Impact Position

A square takeaway will promote a clubface that returns to a square position at impact. Combined with a square swing path, a square clubface position at impact doesn't allow for much sidespin, resulting in straight piercing shots.
