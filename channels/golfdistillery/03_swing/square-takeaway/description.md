# Square Takeaway - Summary

A square takeaway sees the shaft pointing at the target when parallel to the ground, positioning the clubhead along the target line. This promotes an inside-square-inside swing path that produces straight shots with minimal sidespin. Taking the club back squarely is the recommended approach for most golf shots. Combined with a square clubface at impact, this path results in straight, penetrating ball flight.
