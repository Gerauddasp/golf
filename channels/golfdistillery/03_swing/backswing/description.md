# Golf Backswing - Summary

The backswing extends from the takeaway completion to the top of the swing position.
Nine critical checkpoints ensure proper execution: straight left arm, grounded left heel (unless flexibility limited), maintained right knee flex, left knee pointing at ball, gradual hip coil, centered hip position without sway, stable head position, weight transfer to right foot, and slower rhythm than downswing.
Body rotation should be coordinated with arms staying connected to torso throughout the movement.
Common errors include excessive lateral movement (swaying), premature weight shift, and rushing the tempo.
Video demonstrations and practice drills available through related links for each checkpoint.
