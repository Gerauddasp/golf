# High Hands at Finish - Summary

This swing thought encourages golfers to adopt a standing tall position at the finish with hands and elbows held high above shoulder level. It promotes a higher swing plane throughout the motion by mentally committing to a high finish position. The technique is particularly useful for golfers who struggle with a swing plane that is too low. By visualizing a tall finish, your muscles naturally lead you to a steeper backswing with a higher plane. This swing key applies to any situation requiring a full follow-through execution.
