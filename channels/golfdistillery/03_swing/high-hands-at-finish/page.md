# Hold the Swing High at Finish

## Illustrated Golf Swing Thought (Swing Key)

**Alternative Name:** Finish High

### What it promotes

This swing thought has you adopt a **standing tall** position when you finish your follow through.

Rather than finishing with your elbows and hands well below the height of your shoulders, you are encouraged to reach for a high finish instead.

In doing so, this swing key promotes a high finish position and most importantly, **a higher swing plane**.

### What it tries to cure

It is particularly useful for golfers that suffer from having a **swing plane that is too low**.

### Why it works

By consciously telling yourself that you will be standing tall at the finish, your muscles should lead you to a rather steep backswing, one that could be characterized as a high swing plane, or at least one that is **higher** than that of a low plane.

### When to use it

Use it at any time you need to execute a full follow through.
