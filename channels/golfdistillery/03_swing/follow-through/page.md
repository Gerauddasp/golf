**Illustrated Checklist & Tips**

Use the golf tips below in order to improve your golf follow through. This swing sequence occurs immediately after the release and extension and will see your golf swing come to an end.

## Hips Should Face the Target at the Follow Through

At the end of the follow through your hips should be square to the target, meaning that they should be facing the target directly.

This is in contrast to an over rotation that see the hips go past square and to the left of the target, which is indicative of over upper body rotation.

It is also in contrast to an incomplete swing that see the hips never reach the point where they face the target.

## Full Follow Through (Don't Quit At Impact)

While it does occur after the ultimate impact with the ball the follow through is still an integral part of the golf swing and one that should not be sloppily executed.

Indeed, a good follow through and finish position will require a proper journey on the way there. This is in contrast to golfers who simply quit their swings after impact, which highlight deceleration or blocking issues.

## Weight Should Be (Almost) Entirely Over the Left Foot

While your body weight should be evenly split over your two feet at the start of the swing at address, your finish position at the end of the follow through should see all of it resting on top of your left foot.

This is in contrast to seeing your weight located on your right foot at address and during the follow through, which happen in a reverse pivot swing error.

Indeed, the natural weight flow should move towards the back foot during the backswing and it should move towards the front foot during the downswing, progressively moving towards the front as the swing is completed.

Finally, you should be able to hold your finish in perfect balance until the ball lands, if you needed to. Failure to be able to hold your follow through might be indicative of an off-balance swing. And while that may be apparent in the follow through the balancing issues likely started before impact and is likely costing you in the quality of your golf shots.
