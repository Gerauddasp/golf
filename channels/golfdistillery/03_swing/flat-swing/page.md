# Low Plane - Flat Swing

## Definition

[Low Swing Plane Tweak][images/swing-plane-low.png]

A swing that can be defined as having a low plane (or flat swing) is one where the line formed by the straight left arm at the top of the swing shoots down towards the ground at a relatively soft angle. The angle between that line and the spine is over 90 degrees.

This shallow variation represents a deviation from the standard on-plane position.

## Characteristics

### Swing Path Association
- Associates with inside-out swing paths
- Generates right-to-left sidespin tendency

### Ball Flight
- Produces lower-than-normal ball flight
- Creates reduced spin compared to standard swings
- The shallow angle of attack generates less spin

## When to Use a Flat Swing

### Headwind Situations
These characteristics make flat swing planes especially useful for shots into a strong headwind. The lower ball flight and reduced spin help the ball penetrate through wind more effectively.

### Tight Lies
Beneficial for tight lies where a shallower approach angle is advantageous.

### Fluffy Rough
In fluffy lie situations where the ball is sitting up in the rough, a flatter swing is recommended to help shield you from coming in too steeply which could see your club travel down towards the ground and away from the ball that is sitting up.

### Driver and Fairway Woods
A swing with a driver should be flatter than it is for a swing using a wedge, due to the long length of the club which puts your spine in a more standing up posture than for any other club.

### Bunker Shots
For bunker shots that can fly out on a low trajectory, a flat swing plane can be advantageous.

## Natural Factors

The flatter swing plane is often a natural result of:
- Longer clubs (drivers, fairway woods)
- More upright spine angle at address
- Ball position further from the body
