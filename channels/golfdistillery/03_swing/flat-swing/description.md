# Flat Swing - Summary

A flat (low plane) swing features the left arm shooting down at a soft angle at the top, with an angle exceeding 90 degrees to the spine. It associates with inside-out swing paths and right-to-left sidespin tendency, producing lower ball flight with reduced spin. This swing plane is beneficial for headwind conditions, tight lies, fluffy rough, and bunker shots requiring low trajectory. It's naturally suited for longer clubs like drivers due to the more upright spine posture.
