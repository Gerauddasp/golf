# Downswing - Summary

The downswing extends from the top of the swing through ball impact, representing the power delivery phase.
Six fundamental principles: maintain wrist hinge to avoid casting, initiate movement with hips then shoulders then arms in sequence, keep hips centered without forward sway, follow inside-square-inside club path, transfer weight progressively to front foot, and accelerate through impact rather than decelerating.
The critical sequence starts with hip rotation (uncoiling) from the top, followed by shoulders and arms maintaining their lag.
Common errors include casting (early wrist release), over-the-top path, swaying, and reverse pivot weight issues.
Practice drills available to develop proper sequencing and tempo through the downswing phase.
