# Downswing - How to Bring the Golf Club Down Correctly in the Downswing

[Swing Tips for the Downswing][images/swing-tips-downswing.jpg]

The golf downswing begins right after the top of the swing position is reached and ends with the impact with the ball. Follow these tips for a proper downswing.

## Key Downswing Principles

### 1. Maintain Wrist Hinge

Preserve the full wrist hinge established during the backswing; avoid early unhinging, which constitutes "casting."

### 2. Sequential Movement: Hips, Shoulders, Arms

"The hips should be first in reversing action – or uncoiling – when reaching the top of the swing." Shoulders and arms follow this sequence.

**Related Thought:** Hips uncoil first from the top

### 3. Hip Stability

Hips uncoil while remaining centered; prevent forward sliding (swaying).

### 4. Club Path: Inside-Square-Inside

The clubhead approaches from inside the target line, meets it squarely, then returns inside during follow-through. Avoid "over the top" errors.

### 5. Weight Transfer

Weight progressively shifts toward the front (left) foot during downswing rotation.

**Related Error:** Reverse Pivot

### 6. Acceleration

The downswing pace should exceed the backswing pace to prevent deceleration.

**Related Error:** Deceleration, or Decel
