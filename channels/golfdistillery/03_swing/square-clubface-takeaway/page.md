Keep the clubface square during the takeaway

---

## What it promotes

This swing key promotes straight and penetrating shots with a consistent ball flight by facilitating a square clubface position at impact.

## What it tries to cure

This swing thought tries to cure:

- Early wrist manipulation (getting "handsy or wristy")
- Clubface rolling open during the backswing
- Laid-off swing positions that can cause shanks
- Compensatory movements needed to square the face at impact

## Why it works

A square takeaway naturally returns the clubface to a square impact position, minimizing sidespin when combined with an appropriate swing path.

## When it's useful

This swing key is beneficial for most golf shots throughout play.
