The club should be brought back in line with the target line. Specifically, this means that when the shaft of the club is parallel to the ground the club should be pointing straight ahead.

### 2. Clubface Angle

The leading edge of the club should tend to point towards the ground slightly, towards the ball rather than pointing upward (open) or at too steep an angle (closed).
