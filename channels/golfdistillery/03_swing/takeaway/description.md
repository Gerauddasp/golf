# Golf Takeaway - Summary

The takeaway is the critical first movement of the golf swing that sets up all subsequent positions.
Four key checkpoints: shaft alignment with target line when parallel to ground, proper clubface angle pointing slightly downward, wrist hinge through shoulder rotation not hand manipulation, and maintaining the triangle formed by arms and shoulders.
The club should point straight ahead when shaft is parallel to ground, not inside or outside the target line.
Leading edge should point toward the ball, avoiding both open (pointing up) and overly closed (too steep) positions.
Hands move away from body through shoulder rotation while staying in front of chest, keeping the arm-shoulder triangle intact.
