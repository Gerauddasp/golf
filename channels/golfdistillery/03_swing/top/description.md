# Top of the Swing - Summary

The top of the swing is the transition point between backswing and downswing, requiring precise positioning.
Six critical checkpoints: flat left wrist without bowing or cupping, shaft pointing at target or parallel to target line, shaft parallel to ground (or slightly short), maintained spine angle from address, back facing target through full rotation, and fully hinged wrists.
Common errors include laid-off position (shaft points right of target) or across-the-line position (shaft points left of target).
Proper wrist hinge and spine angle maintenance are crucial for generating power while maintaining control.
