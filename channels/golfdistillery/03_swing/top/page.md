# Top of the Swing - How to Set your Golf Club Correctly at the Top

[Swing Tips for the Top of the Swing][images/swing-tips-top-of-the-swing.jpg]

The top of the golf swing occurs right after the backswing and is followed by the downswing. Follow these tips for a proper top of the swing position.

## Key Top of Swing Checkpoints

### 1. Left Wrist Position

The wrist should be "fully hinged" without bowing or cupping. "The top of the left hand lines up with the rest of the forearms and upper arm."

### 2. Shaft Alignment

"The shaft of the club should be pointing straight ahead, at the target" or parallel to the target line—avoiding laid-off or across-the-line positions.

### 3. Shaft Level

"Hands should stop rising when the shaft reaches the point where it is parallel to the ground, or just shy of that position."

### 4. Spine Angle

### 5. Back Positioning
