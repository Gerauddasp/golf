# Across the Line at the Top - Summary

An across the line error occurs when the club shaft crosses over the target line at the top of the backswing.
This is typically caused by overswinging or failing to keep the left arm straight during the backswing.
The primary problem is that it leads to an over the top swing path, causing slices and pulls.
To fix it, use a one-piece takeaway with shoulders initiating the movement and the grip pointing at the target when parallel.
At halfway back, hands should be shielded by your body, and at the top, stop before the club crosses the target line.
