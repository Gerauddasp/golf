# Open Clubface Takeaway - Summary

An open clubface takeaway occurs when the clubface points at the sky when the shaft is parallel to the ground, caused by overly active wrists rotating clockwise. This leads to slices and fades because golfers often fail to rotate the club back to square at impact, requiring precise timing compensation. An open takeaway can also create a laid off position causing shanks. The preferred square clubface position keeps hands quiet and the leading edge perpendicular or slightly toward the ground.
