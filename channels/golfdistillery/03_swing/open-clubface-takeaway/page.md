# Open Clubface Takeaway

## Overview

This article explains proper clubface positioning during the takeaway, presenting three distinct positions with only one being correct.

## Open Clubface Position (Incorrect)

An open position occurs when the face of the club will be pointing at the sky when the shaft is parallel to the ground.

### Cause

This results from overly active wrists causing clockwise rotation during the early stages of the takeaway.

### Problems Created

#### Slice and Fade Issues
The article warns this "leads to cutting the ball at impact" and can produce shots veering right of target. This occurs because the golfer will oftentimes fail to fully rotate the club back in time for impact with the ball.

#### Timing Complications
An open clubface takeaway requires precise compensation during the downswing. When players roll the club open during the takeaway, they create complications requiring precise hand rolling at impact. Failure to time this correctly produces slices or fades.

#### Laid Off Position
Additionally, an open takeaway can lead to a "laid off top of the swing position," potentially causing shanks.

### Why It's Problematic

An open clubface takeaway can lead to an open clubface at impact because the golfer will oftentimes fail to fully rotate the club back in time for impact with the ball. This contributes to slice issues.

## The Problem with Early Wrist Action

Most golf shots benefit from avoiding this technique. The issue stems from becoming "handsy or wristy early in their swing," which typically results in an open clubface.

## The Preferred Alternative

Ideally you should pursue a square clubface during the takeaway. Situated in between an open and a closed position, the square clubface will be one where the leading edge of the club will be perpendicular to the ground, again when the shaft is parallel to the ground.

For shots that will penetrate through the air with all the possible vigor and in a straight line the leading edge of the club should tend to point towards the ground slightly, towards the ball.

The hands should remain mostly quiet during this early stage of the backswing when maintaining a square clubface position.
