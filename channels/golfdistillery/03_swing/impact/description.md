# Golf Impact - Summary

Impact is the moment of truth where club meets ball, making it the most critical position in the golf swing.
Six essential checkpoints: hands ahead of clubhead maintaining lag, retained knee flex, hips rotated toward target, maintained spine angle from address, eyes focused on ball at contact, and proper attack angle based on club type.
Iron shots require descending strike with ball-first contact, while woods need ascending strike with clubhead rising at impact.
Proper impact position results from correct execution of all previous swing sequences including setup, takeaway, backswing, top position, and downswing.
Practice drills and swing thoughts available to develop consistent, solid contact at impact.
