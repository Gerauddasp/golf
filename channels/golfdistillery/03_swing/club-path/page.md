# Modify your Swing (Club) Path to Shape your Golf Shots

The way the golf club crosses the target line at impact – as well as before and after – is defined as the swing path and it can vary across three different types.

## Inside-Square-Inside Swing Path

This swing path features the club head crossing the target line at impact only, as it will be traveling inside of the line both prior to and following that impact. This approach promotes a straight swing path as it naturally follows the restrictions set by your body, which sees your upper and lower body rotating around its central axis.

### What It Promotes

A straight shot to the target with minimal sidespin when the clubface is square at impact.

### Clubface Position Effects

- **Square clubface:** Straight shot to target
- **Closed clubface:** Hook with right-to-left sidespin
- **Open clubface:** Slice with left-to-right sidespin

## Outside-In Swing Path

An outside-in swing path will see the clubhead move outside of the target line right after address, during the takeaway and backswing, then cross that line at impact and follow its course inside during the follow through. The path is aimed left of the target and is often referred to as an over the top.

### What It Promotes

Left-to-right side spin, producing fades and slices. The club cuts the ball at impact, commonly associated with slicing.

### Clubface Position Effects

- **Clubface matches swing path angle:** Pulled shot (straight shot to the left of the target)
- **Clubface closed relative to path, open to target:** Fade toward target
- **Clubface open to both path and target:** Slice away from target

## Inside-Out Swing Path

An inside-out swing path will see the clubhead move inside of the target line right after address, but will have been brought too far inside. This results in the clubhead crossing the target line at impact and continuing outside during the early follow through instead of returning inside. The path is aimed right of the target.

### What It Promotes

Right-to-left side spin, producing draws and hooks. The club cuts the ball at impact, commonly associated with hooking.

### Clubface Position Effects

- **Clubface matches swing path angle:** Pushed shot (straight shot to the right of the target)
- **Clubface closed relative to path, open to target:** Draw toward target
- **Clubface closed to both path and target:** Hook away from target
