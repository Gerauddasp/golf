## What it promotes

This swing thought promotes swing fluidity and helps golfers maintain a progressive swing acceleration from address through impact.

## What it tries to cure

It targets hurried or rushed swings that commonly result in deceleration near the ball—a damaging swing error.

## Why it works

Golf swings perform optimally when accelerating progressively toward impact. This swing thought helps golfers recognize this progressive acceleration as fundamental, promoting cleaner contact with the ball.

## When it's useful

This principle applies universally from the drive on hole number 1 to the last putt at the end of the round.
