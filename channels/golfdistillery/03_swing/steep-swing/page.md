# High Plane - Steep Swing

## Definition

[High Swing Plane][images/swing-plane-high.png]

A swing that can be defined as having a high plane (or steep swing) is one where the line formed by the straight left arm at the top of the swing shoots down towards the ground at a steep angle. The angle between this line and the spine measures under 90 degrees.

This represents a deviation from the standard on-plane position.

## Characteristics

### Swing Path Association
- Often paired with outside-in swing paths
- Generates left-to-right sidespin tendency

### Ball Flight and Spin
- Creates elevated ball flight with increased spin
- Steep swings tend to transfer more spin into the ball
- This can lead to higher than normal golf shots

## When to Use a Steep Swing

### Buried Lies in Tall Grass
Steep swings can be useful for getting to a ball buried in tall grass, allowing the clubhead to reach straight into the ball without being slowed down by grass blades. The steeper angle of attack helps the club cut through the grass more effectively.

### High Bunker Shots
A steep swing is advantageous for high bunker shots where you need to get the ball up quickly and land it softly on the green.

### Ball Below Your Feet
When hitting a golf shot with the ball below your feet, you should use a steeper swing rather than a flatter one, as a steeper swing works best when the ball is lower than your feet.

### Wedge Play
A steep swing is coherent with the short club (wedge) in your hand and helps protect against flatter swing planes. The shorter club length naturally promotes a more bent-over spine angle, which supports a steeper swing plane.

## Natural Factors

The steeper swing plane is often a natural result of:
- Shorter clubs (wedges, short irons)
- More bent-over spine angle at address
- Ball position closer to the body
