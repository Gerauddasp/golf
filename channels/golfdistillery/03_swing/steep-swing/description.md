# Steep Swing - Summary

A steep (high plane) swing features the left arm shooting down at a steep angle at the top, with an angle under 90 degrees to the spine. It often pairs with outside-in swing paths and left-to-right sidespin tendency, transferring more spin and creating higher ball flight. This swing plane is beneficial for buried lies in tall grass, high bunker shots, balls below your feet, and wedge play. It's naturally suited for shorter clubs due to the more bent-over spine posture.
