# On-Plane Swing (Standard)

## Definition

[Swing On Plane][images/swing-plane-on.png]

A swing that can be defined as on plane is one where the line formed by the straight left arm at the top of the swing crosses the line formed by the spine at a 90 degree angle.

This represents the default swing plane position. Deviations from this standard position are categorized as high plane (steep) or low plane (flat).

## Checking Your Swing Plane

Golf Distillery provides practical drills to verify if you're swinging on-plane:

### Wall Drill

Set up with your buttocks against a wall, begin a practice swing, and note where the clubhead would strike the wall. If you are swinging on-plane, the clubhead should want to strike the wall at about the height of your head.

This simple drill provides immediate feedback on whether your swing plane is correct.

### Top of Swing Check

If the club touches around your shoulder bone when you let it drop, it means your top of the swing position is on-plane.

This checkpoint helps you verify proper positioning at the top of your backswing.

## Understanding Swing Plane Deviations

### High Plane (Steep)
A swing where the straight left arm shoots down at a steep angle, with the angle between that line and the spine being under 90 degrees.

### Low Plane (Flat)
A swing where the straight left arm shoots down at a relatively soft angle, with the angle between that line and the spine being over 90 degrees.

## The Standard Reference

The on-plane swing serves as the baseline or standard reference point from which all other swing plane variations are measured. While both high and low plane swings have their uses depending on shot requirements, the on-plane swing represents the neutral starting position.

## Importance

Understanding the on-plane position is crucial because it:
- Provides a reference point for evaluating your swing
- Helps identify if adjustments are needed
- Serves as the foundation for making intentional swing plane modifications
- Allows golfers to make informed decisions about when to deviate from standard
