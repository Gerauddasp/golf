# On-Plane Swing - Summary

An on-plane swing features the left arm crossing the spine at exactly 90 degrees at the top of the swing, representing the standard default swing plane position. This serves as the baseline reference point from which steep (high plane) and flat (low plane) variations are measured. Simple drills like the wall drill and shoulder bone check help verify proper on-plane positioning. Understanding this standard is crucial for making informed swing plane adjustments.
