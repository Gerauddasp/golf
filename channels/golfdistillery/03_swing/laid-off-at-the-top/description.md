# Laid-Off at the Top - Summary

A laid-off position occurs when the club stops short of pointing at the target at the top of the swing.
This error typically happens when you bring the club too much inside during the takeaway.
The main consequence is getting stuck in the backswing, requiring difficult compensations during the downswing.
To fix it, use a square takeaway with shoulder rotation rather than excessive hand or forearm action.
Position your right elbow like a waiter holding a tray (90-degree angle) to allow proper backswing completion.
