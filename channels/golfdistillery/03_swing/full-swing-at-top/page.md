# Full Swing at Top

## How to Set Your Golf Club Correctly at the Top

The top of the swing occurs right after the backswing, when you stop coiling your hips and shoulders back. Achieving a proper full swing position at the top requires coordinating several key elements.

### Shaft Position

At the end of the backswing, your hands should **stop rising** when the shaft of the club reaches the point where it is **parallel to the ground**, or just shy of that position.

The club shaft should point directly at the **target**, positioned parallel to the ground or just short of parallel. A **full wrist hinge combined with adequate hip and shoulder rotation** delivers the club to this ideal position without requiring excessive upper-body rotation or elbow flexion.

#### Common Shaft Position Errors to Avoid:

- **Laid-off position:** Shaft points left of target
- **Across-the-line position:** Shaft points right of target
- **Over-rotating:** Pushing the shaft beyond parallel through excessive upper body rotation or left elbow flexion
- **Insufficient rotation:** Leaving the club short of the recommended position

### Body Rotation: Back Facing Target

At the top of a **full swing** your **back should be facing the target**. This only happens when you correctly rotate your hips and shoulders.

This distinguishes a proper full swing from incomplete all-arms swings that lack adequate body turn. Your back facing the target is the hallmark of proper full swing body rotation.

### Wrist Hinging

At the top of the swing your wrist should be **fully hinged**. But more importantly, it should be hinged correctly.

Wrist hinging begins **gradually** when the shaft reaches parallel to ground during the backswing and completes at the top.

The left wrist should remain **flat**—aligned with the forearm—avoiding both:
- **Cupping:** Hand curling upward
- **Bowing:** Breaking toward the ground

These wrist distortions break the proper hand-forearm line and can cause ball flight issues.

### Spine Angle Maintenance

The **spine angle established at address** should remain unchanged throughout the backswing and at the top position.

Failing to maintain this angle causes the golfer to **bend forward**, which represents a common and notable swing flaw. Keep your spine angle constant from address through the top of the backswing.

### Timing and Sequencing

The backswing should take **slightly more time to progress than the downswing**. This allows for proper sequencing of the body rotation, arm swing, and wrist hinge.

**Premature wrist hinging** or mistimed hinging breaks down position quality and can lead to compensations later in the swing.

### Key Checkpoints for a Full Swing at Top:

1. **Shaft:** Parallel to ground (or just shy), pointing at target
2. **Back:** Facing the target (proper hip and shoulder rotation)
3. **Wrists:** Fully hinged, left wrist flat (not cupped or bowed)
4. **Spine Angle:** Maintained from address position
5. **Left Arm:** Remains straight from address through top
6. **Timing:** Gradual, controlled backswing with proper sequencing

### Common Errors Summary:

- Over-rotating the upper body or flexing the left elbow excessively
- Insufficient hip and shoulder rotation
- Cupping or bowing the wrists instead of proper flat hinge
- Bending forward and losing spine angle
- Premature or mistimed wrist hinging
- Rushing the backswing
