# Golf Release - How to Perform the Extension and Rotation

[Swing Tips Release Banner][images/swing-tips-release.png]

The page explains golf release technique, which occurs after ball impact and before follow-through. The guide emphasizes that proper release form improves overall swing mechanics and prevents quitting the swing.

## Keep Upper Body Tilted Forward

Maintain spine angle from impact; avoid rising up, which causes thin shots or slices. Focus on keeping the chest aimed at the ball's former location.

After impact with the ball your first instinct should not be to rise up. You should instead stay with your upper body tilted forward, the same way it was at impact.

By doing so you make sure you do not suffer from two common ball striking problems that can arise from lifting up. Indeed, it will prevent you from hitting thin shots that arise when you straighten your back. It will also help prevent slice shots that can also be caused by straightening your back up too early.

A great way to achieve this is to simply keep your chest aimed at the location where the ball was just a moment before.

## Arms Straight and Extended

After contact, arms should remain fully extended. Visualize the club pulling hands toward the target, as though throwing the club forward.

After you made contact with the ball your arms should also be completely straight and extended. This means that they should be extended away from your body.

A great way to visualize this and make this happen is to imagine the club to be heavy enough in order to pull your hands along towards the target. Imagine as if the club was pulling your hands away from you and that you were throwing the club down the target line.

## Hands Roll Over

[Release Hand Rotation][images/release-hand-rotation-roll.png]

The clubface naturally rotates from open during downswing to square at impact to closed during release. Hands should switch positions, with the bottom hand leading the top hand toward the target. Failure to complete this rotation leaves the clubface open.

Throughout the swing you will need your hands to roll over. This will happen naturally as your hands go from having your clubface open during the downswing to having it square at impact and finally to having it closed in the release.

In the release of the golf swing your hands will see the bottom hand going from below the top hand to above it. In doing so they will roll and will feel like they are switching places.

Failing to do so will result in not completing the necessary hand roll and will keep the clubface open, which will push the ball to the right.

## Natural Hand Release

Too little release causes blocked shots right of target; excessive release produces hooks or draws. Balance is essential.

The hands should release naturally, and not in a lazy fashion nor in an overly aggressive way.

A lazy release will see the clubface fail to close before impact and during the release, resulting in the clubface being open. This will produce blocked golf shots that fly to the right of the target.

An overly aggressive release of the hands will see the clubface close too much and too early, which will produce hooks or draws.

## Club Circles Body

[Club Path Through Release][images/followthrough-swingpath.png]

The club should follow an inside-square-inside path, circling the body. The path taken during takeaway influences the follow-through path.

The club should not be going straight back and through, all the way to your follow through. Instead, it should be circling around your body.

This continues on the path that you may or may not have took going back at the takeaway. If you took the club back to the inside then it should travel on that same path and go back to the inside during your release.

This corresponds to a so-called inside-square-inside club path. At the takeaway the club is going inside, it becomes square at impact with the ball and goes back to the inside during the release and follow through.
