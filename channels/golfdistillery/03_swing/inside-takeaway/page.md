## What is an Inside Takeaway?

An inside takeaway swing error in golf occurs when – assuming you are right-handed – the grip end of the club is pointing to the right of the target at the moment when the shaft of the club reaches a position parallel to the ground, at the takeaway.

In other words, the head of your club will be traveling too close to your body in relation to the target line. Alternatively, the grip end could be said to be traveling too far away from your body at the takeaway, in relation to your target line.

This is in contrast to a straight or square takeaway, which sees the shaft of the club pointing directly at the target at that same point, when the shaft reaches parallel to the ground.

Another sign that you are performing this swing error is looking at your hands from a rear position. In a correct takeaway your hands should be blocking the view of your clubhead. In an inside takeaway your club will be too inside and your hands will not be blocking your clubhead.

## Problems Associated with an Inside Takeaway

An inside takeaway error puts you in a position where you are essentially blocked from moving up. It ultimately creates the need to adjust your club into the correct path later on, if it is even possible to do so.

Indeed, it makes for a difficult – but not impossible – backswing, as you'll need to compensate further along the way to reach the correct top of the swing position.

That error or swing mistake can also encourage an over the top downswing, where you will bring your club down on an outside-in swing path.

## How to Fix an Inside Takeaway

The key to fixing an inside takeaway is to focus on where your club is at the moment the shaft reaches a position parallel to the ground. During your practice swings you'll want to make sure the shaft is pointing directly at the target, and not to the right of the target.

As part of that correction you will want to prevent your hands from rolling over the clubface. Instead, you'll want your clubface to be either parallel to your upper body or pointing up at the sky slightly.
