# Inside Takeaway - Summary

An inside takeaway occurs when the club grip points right of target (for right-handers) when the shaft reaches parallel to the ground, with the clubhead traveling too close to the body relative to the target line. This error creates a blocked position that makes proper backswing difficult and often leads to compensatory "over the top" downswing with an outside-in swing path. The fix involves monitoring club position during practice swings to ensure the shaft points directly at the target when parallel, preventing hands from rolling over and keeping the clubface either parallel to the upper body or pointing slightly skyward. From behind, proper takeaway shows hands blocking the view of the clubhead, whereas inside takeaway reveals the clubhead visible past the hands.
