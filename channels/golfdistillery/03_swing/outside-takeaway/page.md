## What is an Outside Takeaway?

An outside takeaway swing error in golf occurs when – assuming you are right-handed – the shaft of the club is pointing to the left of the target at the moment when the shaft reaches a position parallel to the ground, at the takeaway.

This is in contrast to a straight or square takeaway, which sees the shaft of the club pointing directly at the target at that same point, when the shaft reaches parallel to the ground. It is also in contrast to an inside takeaway – the opposite swing error – where the club shaft will be pointing to the right of the target.

In a correct takeaway the clubhead should be blocking your hands, when you look from a rear position. Put differently, you should not be able to see your hands. In an outside takeaway this will not be the case as the club will be too far ahead.

## Problems Associated with an Outside Takeaway

[High Plane][images/high-plane.png]

An outside takeaway often comes from golfers who use too much of their hands and arms for the takeaway and not enough of their shoulders.

Indeed, instead of turning their shoulders back they will find themselves lifting their club up using their arms and wrists. The result is often a steep swing plane.

This error can also result in an overswing or in a club position that is too high or above the hand level at the top of the swing.

Then – in order to hit the ball solidly – you may need to drop your hands too much on the way down, creating inconsistency in your swing arc from one swing to the next.

## How to Fix an Outside Takeaway

Instead of lifting your club up using your arms and wrists you should seek to roll your shoulders back instead.

In doing so you will keep your hands and arms staying very passive at first. Your hands and arms will get to be more involved as the shaft moves past parallel to the ground and as you are moving into your backswing.
