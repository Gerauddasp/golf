# Outside Takeaway - Summary

An outside takeaway occurs when the club shaft points left of target (for right-handers) when parallel to the ground, typically caused by excessive hand and arm activity instead of proper shoulder rotation. This error often results in lifting the club up with arms and wrists rather than turning shoulders back, creating a steep swing plane and potentially an overswing or hands positioned too high at the top. The resulting inconsistency may require dropping hands excessively during the downswing to make solid contact, creating swing arc variations from shot to shot. The solution involves keeping hands and arms passive initially while rolling shoulders back, with hands becoming more active only after the shaft passes parallel during the backswing transition.
