# Hinge. Don't Cup or Bow.

## Illustrated Golf Swing Thought (Swing Key)

### What it promotes

This swing thought has you adopt the proper wrist hinge at the top of your golf swing.

Specifically, it encourages you to **hinge** your wrists rather than to either cup them or to bow them.

In doing so, you are aiming to see the **top of your left hand** line up with your forearm and upper arm. Visually, this should create a **straight line** when viewed from above.

### What it tries to cure

This is particularly useful for those who are cupping their wrists (hands arc up towards the sky) or are bowing them (hands break down towards the ground).

### The Problem with Cupping

When wrists are **cupping**, the club is closed at the top and will be rotated back during the downswing into what is often an **open clubface**, ultimately resulting in a slice.

A cupped position (left wrist angled up) **promotes an open clubface at impact**, and a clockwise sidespin, which produces slice shots that veer right (for right-handed golfers).

### The Problem with Bowing

A **bowed** left hand does not line up with the forearm but rather breaks towards the ground, as if the club was too heavy.

### Why it works

Correctly hinging your wrists **promotes a straight ball flight**. It does so because the wrists are positioned as they should and are not ultimately exerting sidespin onto the ball.

### When to use it

Use this swing thought anytime you reach the top of your backswing.

It is especially helpful for golfers who struggle with:
- **Slice problems** (check for cupping)
- **Hook problems** (check for bowing)
- Inconsistent ball flight

### The Ideal Position

At the top of the swing your wrist should be **fully hinged**. But more importantly, it should be hinged correctly.

Ideally, the top of your left hand should line up with the rest of your forearm and upper arm - creating what is described as a "flat" wrist position.
