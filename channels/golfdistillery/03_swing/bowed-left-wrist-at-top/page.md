### What is a Bowed Wrist?

A **bowed left hand** does not line up with the forearm but rather **breaks towards the ground**, as if the club was too heavy.

At the top of the swing, bowed wrists look like the club is too heavy to hold in your hands and is visible through your hands **falling to the ground a little**.

## The Problem and Solution

### The Problem with Bowing

When wrists are **bowing**, the club is open at the top and will be rotated back during the downswing into what is often a **closed clubface**, ultimately resulting in a **hook**.

Bowed wrists at the top can cause hooks because the mechanism through which the wrists will uncock as the hands are brought down during the downswing can be **overdone and close the clubface at impact**.

### The Ideal Position: Proper Hinge

Rather than bowing (or cupping), golfers should focus on **proper wrist hinge** at the top of the swing.

Ideally, the **top of your left hand** should line up with your forearm and upper arm. Visually, this should create a **straight line** when viewed from above - this describes what a "flat" wrist position looks like.

### Why Proper Hinge Works

Correctly hinging your wrists **promotes a straight ball flight**. It does so because the wrists are positioned as they should and are not ultimately exerting sidespin onto the ball.

### When to Check Your Wrist Position

Check your wrist position at the top of your backswing, especially if you are experiencing:
- **Hook problems** (may indicate bowing)
- Inconsistent ball flight
- Shots that start straight but curve dramatically left

### The Three Wrist Positions Explained

1. **Flat/Hinged (Correct):** Top of left hand lines up with forearm - promotes straight flight
2. **Cupped (Incorrect):** Hands arc up toward sky - promotes slice
3. **Bowed (Incorrect):** Hands break down toward ground - promotes hook
