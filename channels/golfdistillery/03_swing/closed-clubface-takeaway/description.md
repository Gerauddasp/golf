# Closed Clubface Takeaway - Summary

A closed clubface takeaway occurs when the clubface points toward the ground too severely when the shaft is parallel to the ground, caused by premature counter-clockwise wrist rotation. This leads to hooks because the clubface remains closed at impact, causing shots to launch left of target. While a square clubface does point slightly toward the ground, an excessively closed position angles too severely. The preferred square position keeps hands quiet with the leading edge perpendicular to ground.
