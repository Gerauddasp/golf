# Closed Clubface Takeaway

## Overview

This article explains proper clubface positioning during the takeaway, presenting three distinct positions with only one being correct.

## Closed Clubface Position (Incorrect)

A closed position occurs when the face of the club will be pointing towards the ground when the shaft is parallel to the ground.

During the takeaway it is possible that you are bringing your club up with a face that is too closed, or in other words with a face that is angled towards the ground too severely.

### Cause

Like the open position, this stems from premature wrist activity but manifests as counter-clockwise rotation. The wrists become overly active too early in the backswing.

### Problems Created

#### Hook Issues
This approach "leads to a closed clubface position at impact" and causes shots launching left of target initially. This can contribute to hooks.

#### Excessive Closing
The issue is not that the clubface points at the ground at all, but that it points at the ground too severely or too aggressively. There is a difference between a square clubface (which does point slightly toward the ground) and an excessively closed clubface.

## Three Basic Clubface Positions

During the takeaway, there are three basic clubface positions, with only one being correct:

1. **Open** - Face pointing towards the sky (incorrect)
2. **Closed** - Face angled towards the ground too severely (incorrect)
3. **Square** - Leading edge perpendicular to ground, pointing slightly toward the ball (correct)

## The Preferred Alternative

Ideally you should pursue a square clubface during the takeaway.

### Square Position Details

This swing thought has you focusing on taking the club back so that the leading edge of the clubface is pointing towards the ground slightly when the shaft is parallel to the ground.

For shots that will penetrate through the air with all the possible vigor and in a straight line the leading edge of the club should tend to point towards the ground slightly, towards the ball.

### Key Difference

The square position does see the clubface angled slightly toward the ground, but not as severely as the closed position. This is in contrast to seeing the clubface pointing towards the sky (open) or towards the ground at a too steep angle (too closed).

### Quiet Hands

The hands should remain mostly quiet during this early stage of the backswing when maintaining a square clubface position. Avoiding premature wrist action is key to maintaining proper clubface alignment.
