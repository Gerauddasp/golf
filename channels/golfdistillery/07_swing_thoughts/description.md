# Description

Golf Distillery's Swing Thoughts is a comprehensive index of mental cues and focal points organized by swing phase (address, takeaway, backswing, top, downswing, impact, follow-through).
Each swing thought uses simple metaphors and illustrated diagrams to help golfers correct specific swing issues or reinforce fundamentals during practice and play.
The page emphasizes focusing on only ONE swing thought during actual play, as 75% of PGA professionals use no swing thoughts at all when competing.
Categories include "Top 5" recommendations for woods, irons, and wedges, making it easy to find the most effective thoughts for each club type.
This serves as an educational gateway to detailed individual articles explaining when and how to apply each specific swing thought for maximum effectiveness.
