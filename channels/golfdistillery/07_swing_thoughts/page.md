# Swing Thoughts - Illustrated Guides

![Swing Thoughts Header](images/swing-thoughts.jpg)

## What Are Swing Thoughts?

A swing thought highlights a very specific element of the swing that a golfer tries to focus on when hitting a golf shot. These thoughts frequently take the form of metaphors designed to guide both mental focus and muscle execution toward specific actions.

## Why Use Swing Thoughts?

Swing thoughts prove most valuable when golfers attempt to correct particular issues or return to fundamental swing elements. Swings naturally drift over time through small, incremental adjustments that accumulate into significant changes. Focusing on key swing thoughts helps restore a swing to its intended form.

Alternatively, adopting an entirely new swing key can address specific problem areas in a golfer's game.

## Mental Load Recommendations

While individually beneficial, concentrating on too many thoughts simultaneously creates disorientation and undermines focus. Research indicates that 75% of PGA Professionals have no swing thoughts at all during play.

Most golfers should maintain at most one swing thought during actual play, though experimentation with multiple thoughts during practice sessions can help groove a swing—provided the mind isn't overwhelmed by competing focuses.
