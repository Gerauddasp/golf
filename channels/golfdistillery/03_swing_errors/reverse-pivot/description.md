# Reverse Pivot - Description

A reverse pivot occurs when a golfer shifts weight toward the front foot during the backswing and toward the back foot during the downswing, which is the opposite of correct weight transfer.
This error causes inadequate force transfer to the ball and often results in thin shots because the swing arc's lowest point occurs behind the ball at impact.
The main cause is golfers trying to scoop or lift the ball up, leaving their weight on the back foot and hands behind the ball at impact.
The fix involves three key elements: trusting the club's loft and hitting down on the ball, shifting weight to the back foot during the backswing, and ensuring weight finishes on the front foot at follow-through.
A simple test is whether you can stand on only your front foot at the end of your follow-through - if not, the reverse pivot hasn't been fully corrected.
