# Reverse Pivot

## Golf Swing Error - Illustrated Guide

[Reverse pivot swing error][images/reverse-pivot.png]

A golfer with a reverse pivot swing will move his body weight during his golf swing in the opposite way that he is supposed to.

Indeed, during the backswing he will move his weight towards the front foot while during the downswing he will move his body weight towards his back foot.

This is directly opposite the correct weight distribution direction that is found in an ideal golf swing.

At address the body weight should be split evenly between the two feet. During the backswing weight should be moved towards the back foot until the top of the swing is reached.

From that point on, weight distribution should transition towards the front foot during the downswing until most of the weight rests on top of the front foot at the follow through.

## Problems Associated with a Reverse Pivot Swing

### Inadequate Force Transfer onto the Ball

The golf ball can only fly towards the target with its full shot height and vigor if the golfer is able to successfully transfer the force accumulated during the golf swing into the ball at impact.

But for that to happen, sufficient force needs to be created in the first place.

And that can only happen when weight moves towards the front foot at impact after coming in from the back foot.

### Leads to Hitting Up on the Ball and Thin Shots

Seeing the weight of the golfer resting on his back foot at impact will also see the bottom of the swing arc well behind the ball.

This translates into a far from ideal impact position where thin shots are likely to occur.

## How to Fix a Reverse Pivot

### Stop Trying to Lift the Ball Up

One of the reasons some golfers end up with a reverse pivot is that they feel they need to help lift the ball off the ground.

And the way they proceed is by trying to scoop the ball from underneath, leaving their weight on the back foot and their hands behind the ball.

Sadly, this cannot work on most golf lies because the ball is resting on the ground and therefore it is physically impossible to come from underneath in trying to push it up.

Rather, have confidence in the loft of your golf clubs and trust that it is plentiful in being able to propel the golf high into the air.

Hit down on the ball while keeping your hands ahead of the ball at impact and watch it soar.

### Pivot to your Back Foot during the Backswing

Fixing a reverse pivot starts at the takeaway and the backswing.

Indeed, by focusing on bringing your body weight towards the back foot during these early stages of the swing you are protecting yourself from a reverse pivot before it can start.

When the weight has successfully been brought back, then it's simply a matter of bringing it forward as you proceed with your downswing towards impact with the ball.

### Make Sure to Finish with the Weight on your Front Foot

Now that the takeaway is fixed and that you are no longer shifting your weight towards the front foot during the backswing (see above) it's now just a matter of completing the weight transfer.

As you initiate the downswing you will want to start shifting the weight forward as you head into impact, where the bulk of your weight should be on your front - left - foot.

A good indication of whether you are doing this correctly is to observe the weight distribution among your feet at the follow through.

If you are not able to fully stand using only your front foot at the end of the follow through then something may still be amiss.
