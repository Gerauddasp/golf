# Sway Swing Error - Description

The sway swing error occurs when hips slide laterally instead of rotating around a central axis during the golf swing.
This lateral movement robs golfers of power by preventing proper hip rotation and coiling, resulting in an all-arms swing.
Swaying also creates inconsistency by making the bottom of the swing arc unpredictable, leading to poor contact.
The fix involves loading weight on the instep during rotation and leaning the right knee in to prevent lateral hip slide.
Key swing thoughts include "Turn. Don't Sway." and "Belt Buckle Facing the Target" to maintain proper rotation.
