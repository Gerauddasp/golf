# Sway Swing Error

[Swaying (sway) swing error][images/swaying.png]

The sway swing error involves hips moving laterally during the golf swing. During the backswing, hips slide toward the back foot; during downswing and impact, they slide forward.

In a better swing, the golfer's body weight will move back and forth mostly through the rotation of the upper body along a central axis.

## Problems Associated with Swaying

### All Arms Swing

Lateral hip movement prevents proper hip rotation and coiling, resulting in an all-arms swing where only the shoulders will rotate, robbing you of considerable power and consistency.

### Inconsistency

Sliding your hips back and forward makes it difficult to achieve this consistent strike position. The bottom of the swing arc becomes unpredictable.

## How to Fix Swaying

### Weight Distribution

[Focus on turning and bringing your weight onto your instep, not outside of your foot][images/swaying-weight-instep.png]

Load weight on the instep (inside of your foot) rather than the outside during rotation, ensuring proper positioning for the downswing.

### Knee Positioning

Lean your right knee in during setup or as a swing trigger to lock the knee in place, forcing hips to turn instead of slide laterally.
