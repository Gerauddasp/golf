# Outside Takeaway - Description

An outside takeaway occurs when the club moves away from the body during the first phase of the swing, with the shaft pointing left of target instead of straight ahead.
This error typically results from overly active hands and wrists during the initial takeaway phase, pushing the club out and away from the proper swing path.
The outside takeaway leads to a steep swing plane, excessive club travel past parallel at the top, and inconsistent swing arcs between backswing and downswing.
The fix involves rolling the shoulders back while keeping hands and arms passive during the initial takeaway, engaging them only after the shaft passes parallel to the ground.
Key swing thoughts to prevent this error are "Don't get wristy" and "Go back square" to maintain proper club position throughout the takeaway.
