# Decel Golf Error - How to Stop Decelerating your Swing into Impact

## Golf Swing Error – Illustrated Guide

A decel swing error occurs when the club is losing speed as it heads into impact with the ball instead of continuing to accelerate. It is the opposite of accelerating, which requires the club to be heading into the ball at its fastest pace of the swing.

## Problems Associated with a Decel

### Loss of Power

For full swings with most clubs this swing error will rob your swing of power and will prevent you from transferring as much energy onto the ball as you would through a normal swing that features an acceleration. Indeed, your backswing helps coiling the muscles that will be used in the downswing through rotations of your hips and shoulders. But this potential energy will dissipate during the downswing if you don't apply it to the ball by accelerating the club as you are making contact.

### Risk of Chunks and Double Taps

For shots close to the green and for putting strokes this swing error will put you at risk of chunking the ball. These fat shots will see the clubhead hit the ground before it makes contact with the ball.

Similarly, decelerating will also put you at risk of hitting thin shots or for skulling the ball. Finally, it will also increase the likelihood of double tapping the ball, which occurs when the clubhead hits the ball while it is in midair, twice.

## How to Fix a Decel

### For Full Swings: Adopt a Slower Backswing

Golfers that are experiencing decelerating swings may be taking their club away from the ball too fast.

While it may seem counter-intuitive, it will be easier to accelerate into the ball if you are not going too fast during your backswing. Indeed, a fast backswing can be hard to match during the downswing, leading you to try and slow things down and preventing you from accelerating into impact.

### For Chipping & Putting Swings: Adopt a Shorter Backswing

Golfers who are decelerating during chipping and putting strokes are usually to blame for adopting too long of a backswing.

The tendency is to bring the club back further from the ball than what is needed and to compensate by reducing the speed as the club makes its way back. Instead, golfers should aim to bring the club back only a short distance from the ball and to try and accelerate the club as it makes it way to the ball. An added benefit of a short backswing is that it will allow for greater control and it should help you avoid decelerating.
