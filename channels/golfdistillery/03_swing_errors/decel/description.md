# Decel Swing Error - Description

A decel swing error occurs when the club loses speed approaching impact instead of accelerating through the ball.
For full swings, deceleration causes loss of power and prevents efficient energy transfer from backswing coiling to ball contact.
For short game shots, decel increases risk of fat shots, thin shots, skulled shots, and double-tapping the ball.
The fix for full swings is adopting a slower backswing to enable easier acceleration through impact.
The fix for chipping and putting is shortening the backswing to maintain acceleration and improve control.
