## Off-Balance Swing

### Golf Swing Error – Illustrated Guide

All great golf swings share a common characteristic: execution while maintaining perfect balance. While a proper golf swing technique won't guarantee better scores, performing it while off-balance almost certainly produces poor results.

## What is an Off-Balance Swing?

### Unable to Maintain Follow Through Position

An off-balance swing typically becomes apparent during the follow-through rather than the backswing or downswing. When golfers lose their footing after hitting the ball, it indicates balance issues that began earlier in the swing but were concealed by the swing's rapid speed.

If you cannot stand tall on your left foot without shuffling after hitting a shot, you likely swung off-balance, which negatively impacts shot quality and consistency.

## How to Fix an Off-Balance Swing

To correct this error, maintain perfect balance throughout all swing sequences while monitoring how your weight transfers between your feet.

### Setup Position

[Your weight should be equally distributed between your two feet at address for full swing golf shots][images/off-balance-fix-setup.png]

At address, distribute your weight 50/50 between both feet and 50/50 between toes and heels. You should be perfectly balanced before beginning.

[Your weight should be towards the center of your feet; not towards your toes nor your heels][images/off-balance-fix-setup-weight.png]

To test this, have someone gently push you from different directions (shoulders, hips, chest). If your weight leans toward your toes or heels, you'll lose balance easily.

### Backswing and Top of Swing

During takeaway and backswing, weight gradually shifts toward your back foot. However, even at the top of the swing, weight isn't entirely on your right foot—you should still raise your right toes.

### Impact Position

As you approach the ball, weight shifts toward your left foot. At contact, most weight should rest on your front foot, making it difficult to lift your left toes or heel. Your right heel should begin lifting.

### Follow Through Position

At the finish, weight sits almost entirely on your front foot. Only your right toes touch the ground, and you should hold this position comfortably.

## Practice Slow Motion Swings

Practice slow-motion swings while observing gradual, balanced weight transfer between feet. Gradually increase speed until matching your normal swing speed, then test with actual shots.
