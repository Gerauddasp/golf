# Off-Balance Swing - Description

This page addresses the common swing error of losing balance during the golf swing, which becomes most apparent when unable to hold the follow-through position.
The guide explains proper weight distribution at setup (50/50 between feet and between toes/heels) and how weight should transfer throughout the swing sequence.
It covers the gradual shift toward the back foot during backswing, forward shift through impact, and final position with nearly all weight on the front foot.
The page includes six detailed diagrams showing proper balance positions at each stage of the swing from setup through follow-through.
Practice recommendations include slow-motion swings to develop feel for balanced weight transfer before progressing to full-speed shots.
