# Scooping the Ball

## What is Scooping?

Scooping the ball – or flipping the club – occurs when you try to help the ball get high into the air by unhinging your wrists before impact with the ball is made.

Golfers who scoop the ball lack the confidence that the loft found on their club will be enough to send the ball high into the air. And instead they'll try to help the ball get up by unhinging their wrists ahead of impact with the ball.

This is in contrast to hitting down on the ball, where the ball is to be trapped between the face of the club and the ground.

## What Problem does it Create?

### Thin & Fat Shots (or Skyed Shots)

When you scoop the ball you place your hands behind the clubhead at impact, instead of ahead of it. In doing so, you move the lowest point of your swing arc to a position that is located behind the ball.

And in doing so you'll be bringing the leading edge of your club into the ball first. Or you'll be hitting the ground ahead of the ball if your hands go from behind the clubhead to being ahead of it at impact.

Finally, instead of a predictable point of impact you'll have an unpredictable one. And you'll lose confidence in the quality of your strike and in the distance the club will produce.

## How to Stop Scooping the Ball

### Keep your Hands Ahead of the Club at Impact (Keep the Lag)

Instead of letting your hands trail behind the clubhead through impact make sure your hands are ahead of the club at all times, including at impact and at the follow through. In doing so you'll keep the lag that was created earlier in your swing and you'll make sure you hit the ball before you hit the ground.

### Strike the Ball before the Ground (Trap the Ball)

Since you should aim to strike the ball before you hit the ground, a divot will naturally be created. And that divot will naturally be located in front of the ball, which is in contrast to a divot that is located behind the ball for golfers who scoop the ball.

### Let the Loft of your Club Work for You

Finally, have confidence in the natural loft of your club and don't feel like you need to help the ball go up into the air. The loft is already built into your club and if you simply strike the ball and the ground right after it then the ball will naturally be sent into the air.

## Swing Thought

### Keep the Lag

Make sure your hands stay ahead of the club throughout the swing, including at impact with the ball and during the follow through.

### Trap the Ball

Make sure you hit the ball before you hit the ground. Doing so will trap the ball between the clubface and the ground and make your divot naturally be located in front of where your ball was.

### Focus on the Front Half of the Ball

If you have trouble hitting the ball before the ground, try focusing your eyes on the front half of the ball – that which is the closest to the target – instead of the back of the ball. In doing so you should naturally move your point of impact to later in your swing.
