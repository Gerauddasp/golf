# Scooping - Description

Scooping occurs when golfers unhinge their wrists before impact, attempting to manually lift the ball into the air instead of trusting club loft.
This swing error causes thin shots, fat shots, and inconsistent contact because the hands trail behind the clubhead at impact.
The fix requires keeping hands ahead of the club through impact, striking the ball before the ground to create a divot in front of the ball's position.
Golfers must trust that the club's built-in loft will naturally lift the ball when proper contact is made with a descending blow.
Key swing thoughts include "keep the lag," "trap the ball," and "focus on the front half of the ball" to eliminate scooping from your game.
