# Over the Top - Description

This page explains the "over the top" swing error where the clubhead travels outside the target line during the downswing, creating an outside-in club path.
The error prevents straight shots and reduces power transfer to the ball since the club swings across rather than through the ball.
Two primary fixes are presented: adopting a square takeaway instead of bringing the club outside early, and initiating the downswing by dropping the right elbow down rather than moving it forward.
The page includes four instructional diagrams showing the error and both correction techniques, plus two helpful swing thoughts for practice.
