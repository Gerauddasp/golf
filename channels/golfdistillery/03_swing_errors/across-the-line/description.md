# Across the Line - Description

The "across the line" swing error occurs when the club shaft points right of the target at the top of the backswing, having crossed over the target line.
This problem typically stems from over-swinging or excessive wrist action combined with raising the right shoulder too high.
The main consequence is that it leads to an over-the-top downswing movement, producing pull shots and slices.
The fix involves three checkpoints: proper one-piece takeaway with grip pointing straight ahead, hands behind chest at halfway back, and stopping before crossing the line at the top.
A slightly shorter backswing with the shaft pointing left and skyward is preferable to crossing the line.
