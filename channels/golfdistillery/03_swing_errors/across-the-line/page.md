## What Does it Mean to be Across the Line?

Your club is said to be **across the line** at the top of the swing when the shaft of your club points to the right of the target. In other words, the shaft of the club will have crossed over the target line. This is in contrast to being **laid off**, where the club shaft would be pointing to the left of the target instead.

## What Causes an Across the Line Swing?

[Over-swinging and failing to keep left arm straight can lead to across the line swing][images/across-the-line-causes.png]

Your club will likely be across the line at the top if you are **over swinging**, meaning that you are extending your backswing too far back. It can also be caused by **too much wrist/hand action** combined with raising your right shoulder too much, or by failing to keep your left arm straight during the course of the backswing.

## What Problems are Associated with Going Across the Line?

A club that is across the line at the top poses one main problem. Indeed, going across the line will generally lead to an **over the top** swing movement on the downswing. And swinging over the top will in turn produce pull shots and slices.

## How to Fix Going Across the Line?

There are multiple checkpoints during the backswing that you can use to make sure you don't cross the line. Going through those checkpoints should help you keep the club more in line with the target at the top and hopefully prevent you from swinging over the top on the downswing.

### Check #1: The Takeaway

[During takeaway when shaft is parallel to ground, club should point straight ahead][images/across-the-line-fix-takeaway.png]

Your first checkpoint comes during the takeaway phase. Make sure to rotate your shoulders as part of a **one-piece takeaway**. When the shaft of your club becomes parallel to the ground the end of the grip should be pointing straight ahead.

### Check #2: Halfway Back

[At halfway back position, hands should be in middle of chest, shaft pointing at ball][images/across-the-line-fix-halfway-back.png]

Your next checkpoint comes at the **halfway back position**. At that point in the backswing your hands should be positioned straight behind you, or right in the middle of your chest. The shaft of your club should be pointed toward the ball.

### Check #3: At the Top

Your final and last checkpoint comes at the top. Make it a point to stop your backswing before your club crosses over the line. A backswing that is slightly short – where the shaft of the club is pointed left and toward the sky – is totally acceptable.
