![Swing Errors Hero Image](images/swing-errors-1.jpg)

Swing errors are specific mistakes that are made in the course of a live golf swing, when the club is moving. This is in contrast to an address & setup error that deals with mistakes made prior to beginning a golf swing, while the golfer is positioning himself ahead of a shot.

This section explores the different swing errors that golfers can make. The causes behind the swing errors are covered, as well as tips on how to fix them.
