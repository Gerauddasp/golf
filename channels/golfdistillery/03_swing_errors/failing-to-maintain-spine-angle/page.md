# Failing to Maintain your Spine Angle

[Failing to maintain the spine angle swing error][images/failing-spine-angle.png]

## Overview

The failing to maintain your spine angle swing error is just that. It is a feature of a golf swing where the spine angle, first set at address, is allowed to be altered as the swing progresses through the backswing, downswing and/or at impact.

A proper golf swing will see the spine angle remain relatively constant until after impact with the ball is made, at which point during the follow through the upper body is allowed to rise.

## Problems with Failing to Maintain Spine Angle

The main issue with failing to maintain the spine angle is that it alters the path and trajectory of the club as it moves along the swing plane.

A notable swing error sees the golfer rising just ahead of impact and in doing so raising the bottom of the swing arc just before contact is made with the ball. If the upper body is to rise before the ball is struck the hands will rise too and they will raise the clubhead and the bottom of the swing arc. This situation will lead to inconsistent shots, more specifically thin shots that produce no divots and whose ball flight doesn't climb as high into the air as the loft would normally allow.

On the other hand, if the upper body is to lower during the swing this can lead to fat shots where the club strikes the ground before the ball.

## How to Fix: Maintain Your Spine Angle

### Spear Running Through Your Body

A good mental image in helping to maintain the spine angle is to imagine that a giant spear is running through your upper body and into the ground after you assume a proper address position. In this position, your knees are flexed just right and your upper body is tilted forward. Now imagine that you can't lean forward or rise your upper body in this position because of the spear being planted on the ground. Perform your golf swing with the objective of rotating around that spear but without ever pushing up against it or pressing it down. Keep this going until after impact is made with the ball, at which point you can allow the upper body to rise during the follow through.

### Head Against the Wall

A good drill in helping to maintain the spine angle is to imagine your head is leaning against a wall at address. Focusing on this will help set your spine angle in stone – more or less – and will help prevent you from lowering your body during the backswing/downswing and will help prevent you from rising as you head towards impact. Indeed, if you were to lower your upper body during the backswing, your head would 'crash' through the wall. On the other hand, if your upper body was to rise at impact, contact between the wall and your head would not be maintained.

A good way to stop standing up at impact is to focus on your head. Indeed, if the head is not allowed to rise or move at all vertically the upper body will be forced to move while keeping it in place. And in doing so, the spine angle should remain constant throughout the swing, which is one the things being sought.

## Related Information

The angle you tilt your upper body forward at address should be more or less set in stone as you progress through the swing and rotate the club around your body through the movement in your hips, shoulders and hands.

The swing key promotes consistency in your knee flex and upper body tilt throughout your swing. Indeed, by focusing on keeping your head relatively still you are making sure that you don't bring your upper body forward and down during the backswing and that you aren't rising, or locking up your knees as you bring the club back down towards impact. Keeping the angles of your spine and knees relatively constant will help your chances of hitting the ball on the sweetspot of the club.
