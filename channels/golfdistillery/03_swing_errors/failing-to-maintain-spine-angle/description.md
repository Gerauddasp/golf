# Description: Failing to Maintain Your Spine Angle

This page addresses the common swing error where golfers change their spine angle during the swing rather than maintaining the forward tilt established at address.
The error causes inconsistent ball striking, with rising at impact producing thin shots and lowering causing fat shots.
Two mental imagery drills are provided: the "spear" visualization for maintaining rotational axis and the "head against wall" technique for preventing vertical movement.
The key principle is that spine angle should remain constant through impact, only rising naturally during the follow-through after ball contact.
Maintaining consistent spine angle and knee flex throughout the swing improves chances of hitting the ball on the clubface sweetspot.
