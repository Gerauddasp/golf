# Locking Your Left Knee at Impact

This swing error occurs when the left leg gradually straightens during the downswing, resulting in a completely straight leg with no knee flex at impact.
The main consequence is that it changes hip angle and direction, pulling hips left and creating an outside-in club path that produces left-to-right spin.
The recommended fix is to keep your head "in the box" – maintaining its vertical and horizontal position throughout the swing, which prevents the hips from rising.
By focusing on head position as a proxy for leg movement, golfers can maintain consistent knee flex and avoid the locked knee position.
