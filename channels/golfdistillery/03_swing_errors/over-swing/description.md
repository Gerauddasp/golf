# Over Swing - Description

This page explains the over swing error where the club shaft crosses past parallel (3 o'clock) at the top of the backswing and points downward instead of slightly upward.
The main problem is that golfers often don't realize they're overswinging because the club is behind their head and not visible during the swing.
Overswinging leads to timing issues, shot scatter, loss of power and distance, despite golfers thinking a bigger swing produces more distance.
The recommended fix is to video yourself during actual golf rounds (not practice) to see the error, then train to stop the backswing before the club points at the ground.
Professional golfers demonstrate that a controlled backswing (not past parallel) generates incredible distance through proper timing rather than excessive swing amplitude.
