## What is a Short Swing?

A short swing is a swing error that sees the hands restricted from going all the way up to what would be a typical top of the swing position. Or said differently, it is a golf swing error that sees the shaft of the club never reaching the 2 o'clock mark on an imaginary clock that would be facing us.

Indeed, golfers plagued by a short swing will often see their shaft pointing at 1 o'clock or even straight up at noon, instead of the 2 to 3 o'clock mark that is usually associated with normal golf swings.

### Club Points to the Sky at the Top

Golfers that feature a short swing will see their club pointing at the sky instead of seeing it reach a position that is at least parallel to the ground, or close to it.

### Control vs Distance

Golfers often resort to shortening their swing hoping that the distance they give up will reward them with a better control over the golf ball and its trajectory.

While they will indeed forfeit distance through a short swing it is not guaranteed that they will see an increase in control at all.

And while they might be able to reach shorter par-4s in regulation, they will find it more difficult to do so on longer ones. And they may find it extremely difficult, or even impossible to reach par-5s in regulation in any kind of consistent manner.

## How to Fix a Short Swing

In order to fix a short swing and to increase the clubhead speed you will be able to generate at impact you'll need to learn to lengthen your backswing. Doing so will allow your hands to travel higher, to a typical top of the swing position, ideally seeing the shaft come to a point that is between the 2 and 3 o'clock mark.

**However**, make sure not to correct your short swing into an over swing where the club shaft goes way past the point where it would be parallel to the ground.

### Involve your Hips and Shoulders

Make sure that the rotation you use in your swing involves your entire body. More specifically, you'll want to make sure that your hips and your shoulders rotate during your backswing and that you are not simply rotating your arms alone instead.

Indeed, if the shoulder turn and hip turn – or coil – is minimal or inexistant then you run the risk of producing a short swing as your arms will only be able to go so far alone. More on this through the all-arms swing swing error.
