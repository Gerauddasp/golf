# Short Swing - Description

A short swing occurs when the club shaft fails to reach the 2 o'clock position at the top of the backswing, often stopping at 1 o'clock or noon instead.
Golfers commonly shorten their swing hoping to gain control, but this sacrifices significant distance without guaranteeing improved accuracy.
The error often results from an all-arms swing where shoulders and hips don't rotate properly during the backswing.
To fix this, lengthen the backswing by involving the entire body rotation, allowing hands to reach a proper top position between 2-3 o'clock.
However, avoid overcorrecting into an over swing where the shaft drops past parallel to the ground at the top.
