# Locking Your Right Knee

**Golf Swing Error – Illustrated Guide**

[Locking the right (back) knee swing error][images/locking-right-knee.png]

Locking up the back knee involves gradually straightening the right leg during the backswing. At the top of the swing, the error is clearly visible through a right leg that is completely straight, with no knee flex to be found.

In contrast, the right leg in a proper swing will retain most of the knee flex that was initially set at address.

## Problems Associated with Locking the Right Knee

### Changes the Angle in your Hips – Leads to Inside-Out Club Path

The main issue with losing the flex in your right knee during the backswing and at the top of the swing is that it changes the angle and direction in your hips.

More specifically, the act of straightening the right leg will pull your hips towards your right leg. In doing so, it will also open up your hips to the right side.

This will make it difficult to bring the club towards impact in anything but an inside-out club path. In such conditions it will be very difficult to send the ball towards your target in a straight fashion.

## How to Stop Locking Your Right Knee

### Set the Proper Knee Flex at Address

The first step involves checking and setting the proper amount of flex in your knees at address.

Indeed, if you setup with too much flex in your knees – by bending them too much – you could feel the need to straighten them in order to conduct a proper backswing.

Similarly, you could also have too little flex in your knees at address. In this case you could have inadvertently started the swing with a right knee that is already locked, or that is almost locked.

Finally, you should feel your knee flex is right. Not too low and not standing too tall.

### Imagine Your Right Knee is Tied to the Ball

The second step involves helping to make sure you keep your right knee flex throughout your swing.

For this, imagine a string is tied between your right knee and the ball at address. Imagine during your backswing you don't want to pull on that string.

In other words you don't want your knee to move to the right, away from the ball and away from where the string is tied.

In the same vein, don't lock your knee straight either, which would also pull on that imaginary string.

### Lean in Your Right Knee

The final step involves promoting the feeling of the previous step.

To do that, lean your right knee to the inside at address, towards your left knee.

Make this part of your setup routine, or as a swing trigger. Do this so that the right knee is in position and so that it is set firmly.
