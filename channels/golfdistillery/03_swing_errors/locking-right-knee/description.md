# Locking Your Right Knee - Description

This page addresses the common swing error of straightening the right leg during the backswing, which eliminates the knee flex that was set at address.
The locked knee pulls the hips toward the right side and opens them, creating an inside-out swing path that makes straight shots difficult.
Three solutions are provided: establishing proper knee flex at address (not too bent, not too straight), visualizing the knee tied to the ball with a string to prevent lateral movement, and leaning the right knee inward at setup as a swing trigger.
The page includes five detailed diagrams showing the error, its consequence on swing path, and each of the three corrective techniques.
This is a pure instructional guide with no embedded videos, focusing entirely on understanding and fixing this specific backswing error.
