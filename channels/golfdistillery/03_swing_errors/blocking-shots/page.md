# Blocking Shots

[Blocking swing error][images/blocking.png]

Blocked golf shots are shots that shoot straight right when hit by right handed golfers. Blocked shots are essentially pushed shots resulting from a club path that is of the inside-out variety coupled with a clubface that matches the path at impact and will aim at the right. Unlike pushed shots however, blocked shots will have no draw spin applied to them that could potentially bring the ball back to the target.

## Problems Associated with Blocking Shots

### Ball Starts Right of the Target

Because the ball will start its flight path right of the target it has no chance of reaching the target unless draw spin is applied. And because draw spin can only occur if the clubface is closed to the club path, blocked shots – where the clubface matches the club path – have no chance of producing such spin.

### Cannot Produce Straight Shots at the Target

Blocked shots do not allow you to produce straight golf shots aimed at the target. Indeed, because they start right of the target, the only way they can reach the target is through a finely tuned draw spin that could compensate for the initial right aimed start. Such a task could prove impossible when obstacles are found to the right of the target line since it would prevent you from applying any draw whatsoever.

## How to Fix Blocking Shots

### 1. Verify Alignment

The first thing to check is whether or not you are indeed aligned straight ahead. Make sure this is the case by verifying your feet are positioned in a way that see them aligned parallel to the target line. Also, make sure your shoulders, hips and knees are also aligned straight ahead. Finally, verify that the clubface is aimed directly at the target.

### 2. Get a Square Takeaway

Unlike a pushed shot that starts right of the target, a blocked shot may not necessarily see the ball reach the target at all, even through draw. As such, the main fix should involve modifying your swing in order to replace the inside-out club path by a more ideal one: the inside-square-inside club path.

A square takeaway is one that sees the end of the grip of the club shooting straight forward when the shaft of the club is parallel to the ground during the takeaway.

### 3. Close the Clubface to the Path

If changing your inside-out swing path proves particularly difficult you can also look into adopting a draw ball flight instead. Indeed, doing so will close the clubface to the (inside-out) path, helping bring the ball back towards the target.

Move to a somewhat closed stance at address or through strengthening your golf grip in order to promote a closed clubface to the path and a draw ball flight.

### 4. Complete Hip & Shoulder Turns

Finally, an incomplete uncoiling of your shoulders and hips at impact can result in a clubface and club path that do not rotate inward sufficiently, leading to blocked shots. Work on making sure your hips and shoulders fully rotate and are able to bring your club back inside after impact.
