# Blocking Shots - Description

Blocking shots occur when right-handed golfers hit straight right due to an inside-out club path with a square clubface that matches the path at impact.
The ball starts right of target with no draw spin to bring it back, making it impossible to produce straight shots aimed at the target.
Four main fixes include verifying alignment, adopting a square takeaway for an inside-square-inside path, closing the clubface to create draw spin, and completing full hip and shoulder rotations.
The page provides detailed explanations with visual diagrams showing the problem and each solution method with helpful swing thoughts.
Unlike pushed shots, blocked shots have no compensating draw spin, requiring swing path modifications or deliberate draw adjustments to reach the target.
