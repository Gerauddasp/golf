# Swing Errors - Description

This page catalogs 20 common golf swing errors that occur during the actual swing motion, as opposed to setup mistakes.
Each swing error is illustrated with diagrams showing the incorrect position or movement pattern.
The errors cover all phases of the swing from takeaway through impact to follow-through.
Common mistakes include issues with club positioning (laid-off, across the line), body movement (swaying, reverse pivot), and timing problems (casting, decel).
The resource helps golfers identify specific swing flaws and understand their causes for effective correction.
