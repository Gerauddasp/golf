# Laid-Off Swing Error - Description

The laid-off swing error occurs when the club fails to reach its ideal "on-line" position at the top of the backswing, stopping short and pointing left of the target line.
This problem typically results from bringing the club too far inside during the takeaway, causing the golfer to get stuck in the backswing and limiting their ability to complete a full swing.
The primary consequences include forced compensations during the downswing, difficulty hitting straight shots, and significant loss of distance.
The fix involves two key elements: ensuring a square takeaway where the club shaft points at the target when parallel to the ground, and positioning the right elbow correctly with approximately a 90-degree angle.
By maintaining proper right elbow position (like a waiter holding a tray), golfers create the necessary space for the club to reach the correct on-line position at the top of their swing.
