## Swing Error – Illustrated Guide

Swing errors often come in pairs. In this instance, the laid-off top of the swing error is associated with the across the line error. While the latter sees the club going too far at the top of the swing the former sees the club failing to reach its ideal position at the top.

This swing error guide will provide you with insights on how to eliminate laid-off club positioning problems from your swing.

## What is a Laid-Off Position?

### Short of the Target Line

The laid-off position at the top of the swing should be understood in relation to the club's ideal – or on-line – position at the top.

Imagine a line linking the ball with the intended target. Now imagine another line linking the toe end of your shoes. In a square stance those two lines would be parallel.

At the top of the swing, the club should point at the target, or be parallel to the target line and parallel to your feet line.

In a laid-off position at the top of the swing your club stopped short of reaching that desirable, 'on-line' position.

## Problems Associated with a Laid-Off Club Position

### Getting Stuck in the Backswing

The main problem that is associated with a laid-off position is that you can get stuck in your backswing.

This can be the result of bringing the club too much inside during the takeaway and the situation will limit your ability to complete your swing fully. It will also force you to perform compensating errors during the downswing and through impact and those will make it very hard – if not impossible – to produce straight golf shots. Finally, the problem will result in a loss of distance as you will be prevented from taking a full swing.

## How to Fix a Laid-Off Top of the Swing

### Go Back Square and Create Space Under your Right Elbow

First and foremost, make sure that you bring your club back square. Bring your club back initially by rolling your shoulders and see that the shaft of your club – when it is parallel to the ground – points straight ahead at the target. If your club doesn't follow such a path you are likely to be performing a takeaway that is too handsy or that sees your forearms rotate too much.

Secondly, make sure your right elbow is in its correct position at the top of the swing. Imagine that you are a waiter holding a tray at a restaurant. In this ideal position, your right elbow features an angle that is close to 90 degrees. And it is in that position that you will be able to create the space your right elbow needs in order to let your club shaft reach an on-line position at the top of the swing.
