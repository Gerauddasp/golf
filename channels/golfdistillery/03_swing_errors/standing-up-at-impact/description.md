# Description

This page explains the swing error of standing up at impact, where a golfer changes their forward spine angle during the downswing.
The main consequence is raising the bottom of the swing arc, leading to inconsistent thin shots that don't achieve proper height or divot contact.
Two primary fixes are presented: a spine angle drill using a club held at chest height, and keeping the head stationary in an imaginary box.
The drill emphasizes maintaining the address spine angle throughout the swing while the club rotates naturally.
Related swing thoughts include keeping eyes on the ball and avoiding locked knees during impact.
