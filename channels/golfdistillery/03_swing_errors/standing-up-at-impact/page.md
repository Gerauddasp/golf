## What is Standing Up at Impact?

Standing up at impact is a golf swing error that involves changing the forward spine angle during the swing, specifically at impact.

## The Problem

[Standing up leads to thin shots][images/standing-up-problem-thin.png]

Standing up at impact modifies the bottom of the swing arc, which leads to shot inconsistency.

When the upper body rises before striking the ball, the hands elevate, raising the clubhead and the swing arc's lowest point. This typically results in thin shots that lack proper divots and fail to achieve the expected ball flight height for the club's loft.

## Fixes for Standing Up at Impact

### Spine Angle Drill

Hold the club at chest height pointing toward the target. During mock backswing and downswing, keep the spine angle constant while the club rotates to point at the ball and ground respectively.

The key is to maintain the spine angle established at address throughout both the backswing and downswing.

### Keep Head in the Box

[Head in the box fix][images/standing-up-fix-head-in-box.png]

Maintain vertical head position throughout the swing. Keep eyes focused on the ball and avoid lifting your head at impact to watch the ball flight.

When the head stays stationary vertically, the upper body will be forced to move while keeping it in place, helping to maintain spine angle.
