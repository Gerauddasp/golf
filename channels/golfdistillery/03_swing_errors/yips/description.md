# Yips - Description

The yips are involuntary wrist movements that occur during actual golf shots, causing loss of control particularly in delicate short game situations.
This mysterious condition strikes unpredictably, most commonly affecting putts, chips, and pitch shots where smooth, controlled motion is essential.
While practice swings appear normal, the actual shot involves jerky wrist flicking that closes or opens the clubface unexpectedly.
No definitive cure exists, though mastering fundamentals and practicing under pressure may help manage the condition.
The psychological impact is so strong that golfers who overcome it often refuse to mention the term for fear of its return.
