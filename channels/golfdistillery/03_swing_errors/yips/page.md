## Why Having the Yips is a Problem

The yips represent a loss of control over your body, specifically your wrists, during delicate golf shots. When the yips take hold, your wrists won't behave as expected - they won't keep the hinge at impact as they should.

This swing error can strike at any time, regardless of the club being used. However, it most commonly affects shots that require finesse - pitch shots, chip shots, and putts. The consequences can be catastrophic. While a lengthy distance to the cup might result in a 3-putt situation at worst, executing a putt with the yips can easily send the ball completely off the green.

## How to Fix the Yips

**No cure has yet been found in helping golfers get rid of the yips.** In fact, many golfers who have successfully overcome the yips refuse to mention the term by name, fearing it might cause the condition to return.

### Mysterious Origin, Normally Associated with the Short Game

The origins of the yips remain unclear, but the condition typically manifests during shots requiring finesse - particularly pitch shots, chip shots, and putts.

### Symptoms of Involuntary Motion

Golfers suffering from the yips can execute smooth, controlled practice swings. However, during actual shots, their wrists experience jerky, involuntary movements. This flicking motion causes the clubface to close or open unexpectedly, resulting in misdirected shots.

### How to Try to Fix the Yips

While no definitive cure exists, a two-pronged approach may help:

**Physical Approach:** Master the fundamentals of the shots giving you trouble. Focus on proper setup and grip technique for the affected shots.

**Mental Approach:** Practice under pressure to build confidence. Rather than casual practice on the putting or chipping green, simulate match conditions and high-pressure scenarios to better prepare yourself mentally.
