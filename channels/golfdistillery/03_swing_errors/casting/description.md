# Casting - Description

Casting is a downswing error where golfers prematurely unhinge their wrists, releasing the club ahead of the hands too early.
This early release causes significant distance loss by wasting the energy stored in the wrist hinge before impact.
The error can also lead to a closed clubface at impact, resulting in shots flying left of the target.
To fix casting, golfers should maintain their wrist hinge through the downswing and keep hands ahead of the clubhead at impact.
Visualizing hitting down on the ball and trapping it against the ground helps prevent the scooping motion that causes casting.
