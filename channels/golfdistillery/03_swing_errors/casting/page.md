# Casting

Casting refers to a swing error that takes place early in the downswing and consists in prematurely unhinging the wrists.

Instead of maintaining the full hinge in the wrists from the top of the swing all through the downswing and into impact with the ball, golfers suffering from casting will lose their wrist hinge early and the club will move ahead of the hands instead.

## What is wrong with Casting?

One of the primary issues with casting involves energy loss. While much of the energy of a golf swing is generated through the coiling and uncoiling of the torso, a significant amount is also generated by the hinge in your wrists.

When you are casting the club the energy stored in that hinge is released early and lost to the ball, robbing it of important distance. Casting can also lead to a closed clubface at impact, sending shots to the left of the target for right-handed golfers.

## How to Fix Casting

In order to fix your early release or casting issue you should think of your wrists as glued to their position through the downswing and into impact.

Try to focus on keeping your hands in front of the clubhead at impact.

Another useful swing thought consists in picturing yourself hitting down on the ball and trapping it with the ground, instead of lifting it up or scooping it with the club.
