# All Arms Swing - Description

The all arms swing error occurs when golfers rely almost exclusively on arm movement while neglecting hip rotation and engagement.
This creates two main problems: severely limited power and distance due to lack of energy coiling, and mistiming issues causing wide shot scatter.
The fix involves two key drills: rotating the upper body properly using a chest-club drill, and focusing on weight transfer from back to front foot.
The helpful swing thought "Arms → Shoulders → Hips → Shoulders → Arms" emphasizes the proper sequence of movement throughout the swing.
By engaging the hips correctly, golfers can generate effortless power instead of creating powerless effort through arms alone.
