# All Arms Swing

## Definition

A golf swing said to be an 'all arms' swing is one that features movements almost exclusively limited to that of the arms. Indeed, such a swing error foregoes soliciting the hips, barely or at all.

## Problems Associated with an All Arms Swing

### Limited Power, Distance

The primary issue involves insufficient power generation. Rather than creating and storing energy through hip coiling during the backswing, neglecting hip engagement severely limits the energy transferred to the ball. This results in requiring longer clubs than necessary for shots.

### Mistiming Issues Lead to Wide Shot Scatter

Inconsistent hip engagement between backswing and downswing creates synchronization problems. Examples include: coiling hips during backswing but swinging arms-only during downswing, or failing to coil hips back initially but attempting to uncoil them during downswing. These misalignments produce unpredictable shots with wide scatter patterns.

## How to Stop Swinging Only with Your Arms

### Make Sure to Rotate Your Upper Body

Place the club in front of your chest with your hands and see that the grip end of the club points directly ahead, at the target. Perform a mock backswing and make sure that the end of your club points at the ball when you reach what would be your top of the swing.

This drill ensures shoulders—not arms—perform most work, creating effortless power rather than powerless effort.

### Focus on Transferring Weight

Engaging hips early requires proper weight shifting. During the backswing, weight should transfer to the right foot, only possible if hips rotate. During downswing, weight transfers to the left foot through proper hip uncoiling, ensuring hips actively participate throughout the swing.
