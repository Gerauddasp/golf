# Inside Takeaway - Description

An inside takeaway occurs when the club moves too close to the body during the initial stage of the swing, causing the grip end to point right of the target when the shaft is parallel to the ground.
This swing error puts golfers on the wrong path from the start, often blocking the backswing and forcing compensatory adjustments.
The common result is bringing the club back outside to reach the top, which encourages an over-the-top downswing with an outside-in path.
To fix this error, golfers should practice checking club position when the shaft is parallel to the ground, ensuring it points directly at the target.
The clubface should remain parallel to the upper body or point slightly skyward, avoiding excessive rolling of the hands during the takeaway.
