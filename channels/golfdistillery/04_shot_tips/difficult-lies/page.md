# Difficult Lies: Golf Tips on How to Hit Tricky Shots

[Tips on how to hit golf shots from difficult lies in golf][images/difficult-lies.png]

This section features tips on how to hit golf shots from difficult lies.

Examples of tricky lies include heavy or fluffy rough, tall grass (fescue), tight lie, uneven or sidehill lies.

While a driving range provides near perfect conditions from which to hit golf balls that setup is not always found in the actual golf course, save for the teeing grounds.

Indeed, the conditions of the lie on which your ball rests can significantly impact your choice of shot and club selection. Fail to adjust to these lie characteristics and your scorecard – and your enjoyment of the game – will surely suffer the consequences.

## Heavy Rough

Rough borders fairways and greens. While certain courses feature minimally penalizing rough, others use it to severely punish golfers.

Adjustments need to be made to your setup and swing when the ball is buried in heavy rough or when it is against the grain.

## Fluffy Rough

While longer grass mostly produces a lie where the ball is sitting at the bottom of heavy rough it's not always the case.

Indeed, when the grass is longer but tight and full the ball may find itself sitting up instead, resting on top of the grass instead of between the blades.

While a fluffy lie is not as treacherous as a buried lie there are still modifications that need to be made to the setup and swing.

## Tall Grass (Fescue)

Some courses – especially those in the UK and Ireland – feature longer grass still than your typical rough.

Tall grass can prove a formidable foe if your ball finds itself in its midst. It can be very difficult just to find your ball in fescue, let alone make a clean contact with your club head.

## Tight Lie (Bare Lie)

[Tight Lie][images/tight-lie.png]

Hitting the ball in the middle of the fairway is almost always the objective as it provides the shortest grass (save for the green) and as such the best lie.

That said, some fairways feature grass that is cut very short and that can prove very difficult for amateur golfers. Indeed, some tight lies are so intimidating that you wish your ball had landed in the first cut of the rough instead, with its associated cushion of grass.

Hitting off a tight lie runs the risk of your club head bouncing off the ground and knocking the ball on its side.

## Ball Above Your Feet

Even if hit in the middle of the fairway the ball will not always come to rest on perfectly flat terrain.

Indeed, your ball may come to rest on a sidehill with the ball above the level of your feet. Careful modifications must be made to your setup and swing in order to make clean contact with the ball.

Failure to do so can result in hitting fat shots that land left and short of the target.

## Ball Below Your Feet

Similarly, your ball may come to rest on a sidehill but this time with the ball below the level of your feet.

This lie is particularly difficult to play and unless you make the necessary adjustments you risk hitting the ball thin (if not missing it at all) or hitting it to the right of the target.

## Upslope (Uphill)

Rather than finding yourself in an awkward sidehill situation you may find yourself on the front surface of a hill, for an upslope lie.

While not as intimidating you'll still need to make adjustments to your setup and swing in order to avoid hitting the ground before the ball (for a fat shot) or see the ball land short of the target.

## Downslope (Downhill)

Your ball may come to rest on the other side of a hill and give you a downslope lie instead of an upslope.

This lie is trickier than most and failing to adjust for it may bring in the risk of missing the ball entirely (for a whiff) or hitting it thin and low.
