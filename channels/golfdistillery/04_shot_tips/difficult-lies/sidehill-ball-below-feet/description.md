# Ball Below Feet - Quick Summary

When the ball is below your feet on a sidehill lie, the primary risks are hitting thin or right of target. Set up with weight toward your heels for stability. Widen your stance to lower your swing arc and bend your knees significantly to reach the ball. Use one more club and swing smoothly at reduced speed for balance. Aim left of target to compensate for the ball's natural right tendency. Swing on a steeper plane to ensure the club reaches down to the lower ball position.
