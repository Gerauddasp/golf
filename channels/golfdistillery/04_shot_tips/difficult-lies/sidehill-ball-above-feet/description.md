# Ball Above Feet - Quick Summary

When the ball is above your feet on a sidehill lie, the main risks are hitting fat or left of target. Ensure stable balance at setup, especially on severe slopes. Grip down on the club since the ball is closer to your hands, then use one more club to compensate for the shorter effective shaft length. Aim right of target to account for the natural left tendency. Swing on a flatter plane to avoid digging the clubhead into the ground, particularly if you normally have a steep swing.
