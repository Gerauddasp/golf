# Downslope Lie - Quick Summary

When hitting from a downhill lie, the key is accounting for your front foot being lower than your back foot. Position the ball back of center to avoid thin shots and whiffs. Take a wider stance for stability and tilt your body forward until your shoulders match the slope of the hill. This forward tilt reduces effective loft, causing lower ball flight and more roll, so use one less club than normal to compensate.
