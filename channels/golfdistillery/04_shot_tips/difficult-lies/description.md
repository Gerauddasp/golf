# Description: Difficult Lies

This page introduces eight challenging lie conditions golfers face on the course that differ from perfect driving range conditions.
Each difficult lie type requires specific setup and swing adjustments to avoid poor contact and maintain proper ball flight.
The section covers grass conditions (heavy rough, fluffy rough, tall grass/fescue, tight lies) and uneven terrain situations.
Uneven lies include four slope variations: ball above feet, ball below feet, upslope/uphill, and downslope/downhill positions.
Understanding these lie characteristics and making necessary adjustments is essential for better scorecards and game enjoyment.
