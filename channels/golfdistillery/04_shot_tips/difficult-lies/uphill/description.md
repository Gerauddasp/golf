# Upslope Lie - Quick Summary

When hitting from an uphill lie, your front foot is higher than your back foot, causing the ball to fly higher and shorter than normal. Position the ball forward in your stance to avoid whiffing. Take a wider stance for balance against the slope pushing you backward. Match your spine angle perpendicular to the ground (not vertical) to prevent fat shots. Use one more club because the upslope adds effective loft. Fight to transfer weight to your front foot at follow-through despite the hill's backward push.
