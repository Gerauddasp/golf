## What is a Fade?

In golf a fade – or fade shot – is the name of the trajectory that sees the ball starting inside of the target line after impact but curling out and finishing at the target. In other words, for a golfer that is using a normal stance, the ball will start left of the target and will curve back to the right.

For a right-handed golfer, a fade will see the ball starting its trajectory left of the target and curling back to the right as it drops. For a left-handed golfer, it will see the ball starting right of the target and curling back to the left.

In contrast to a slice, a fade is not a shot error. A fade represents a controlled shot in which the golfer expects the ball to move left-to-right (for right-handed golfers) and finish at the target.

## When Should You Try to Fade the Ball?

You should consider trying to fade the ball when:

- You have a natural tendency to fade the ball and seek to work with – rather than against – your natural ball flight
- You need to curve the ball around an obstacle such as a tree or water hazard
- You are playing in windy conditions and need to control ball flight
- You want a softer landing with less roll after the ball lands

## How to Fade the Ball

### Step 1: Close the Clubface (just a little) to the Left

The first step in hitting a fade is to close the clubface slightly to the left of your target. This is because the ball needs to start its trajectory to the left before it can curve back to the right.

Modern ball flight laws have shown that the clubface is the main factor in determining the initial direction of the ball after impact. So in order for the ball to start left, the clubface needs to be pointing left at the moment of impact.

### Step 2: Open Your Stance

The second step is to open your stance. To do so, rotate your feet to the left until your stance line crosses the clubface line.

This is necessary because you'll want the clubface to be open relative to the swing path. And since you'll be swinging along your body line in the next step, you'll need to set up your body so that it's pointing to the left of the clubface.

### Step 3: Swing Outside-In (Along Your Feet)

The third step is to swing along your body line, which will see you swing from outside-to-in relative to the target line.

Don't try to compensate for your open stance by swinging back toward the target. Instead, swing along your feet line, which should see you swinging to the left of the target.

### Step 4: Expect a Higher Ball Flight and Less Roll

Finally, you should expect the ball to fly higher than normal and to roll less once it lands.

This is because the clubface will be open relative to the swing path, which effectively increases the loft on the club. More loft means a higher ball flight, and a higher ball flight combined with the fade spin will result in less roll after the ball lands.
