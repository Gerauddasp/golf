# Fade Shot - Summary

A fade is a controlled shot where the ball starts left of target (for right-handed golfers) and curves right to finish on target. To execute: (1) close the clubface slightly left, (2) open your stance so it points left of the clubface, (3) swing along your body line creating an outside-in path, (4) expect higher flight and less roll. The open clubface relative to swing path creates fade spin while increasing effective loft. Use fades to work with natural tendencies, navigate obstacles, manage wind, or achieve softer landings with controlled roll.
