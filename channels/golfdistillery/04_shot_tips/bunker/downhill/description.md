# Downslope Bunker Shot - Quick Summary

Hitting from a downslope in a bunker requires significant setup adjustments. Widen your stance for stability and tilt your body forward until your spine is perpendicular to the slope. Use a lob wedge instead of a sand wedge to compensate for reduced effective loft caused by your forward tilt. Make sure your right knee doesn't obstruct your swing path. Expect the ball to fly lower and roll more than a normal bunker shot, so ensure the lip isn't too high to clear.
