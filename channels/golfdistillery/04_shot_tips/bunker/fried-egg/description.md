# Fried-Egg Bunker Lie - Summary

A fried-egg lie occurs when the ball lands in a bunker and stays in the middle of a small crater, sitting lower than normal and surrounded by a ring of sand. To escape this difficult lie: use a square clubface (not open) to help the club dig in, tighten your grip more than usual to prevent club rotation through heavy sand, aim 3 inches behind the ball (outside the ring) to avoid hitting the raised sand first, employ a steeper swing by bringing hands up vertically, expect the club to stay buried after impact rather than following through fully, and aim short of the hole as the ball will roll considerably upon landing. Maintain other typical bunker setup elements like using a sand wedge, gripping down slightly, open stance, wide stance, and forward ball position.
