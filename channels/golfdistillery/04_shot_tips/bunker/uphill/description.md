# Upslope Bunker Shot - Summary

An upslope bunker lie occurs when the ball rolls up the inner side of the bunker and comes to rest in an elevated position, presenting challenges with balance, club digging too deep, and altered ball flight. To execute successfully: widen your stance significantly to maintain balance with your bottom foot positioned lower, tilt your body sideways so your spine is perpendicular to the slope to allow the club to slide underneath the ball rather than digging into the slope, minimize lower body movement and use an all-arms swing to stay stable, and aim closer to the flag than normal since the upslope acts as a launching pad causing higher flight and less roll. Maintain typical bunker setup elements including sand wedge, gripping down, open clubface, open stance, forward ball position, aiming 2 inches behind the ball, and aggressive acceleration through impact.
