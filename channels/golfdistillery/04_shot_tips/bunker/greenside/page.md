# How to Hit a Bunker Shot

[Primary image: Golfer setup for bunker shot][images/bunker-shot-setup.png]

The fundamental objective of a bunker shot around the green is to strike the sand beneath the ball rather than the ball itself, allowing the clubhead to penetrate approximately 2 inches behind the ball.

## Club Selection: Sand Wedge

Sand wedges (typically 56 degrees loft) feature bounce on the trailing edge, helping the clubhead skip off sand rather than dig into it.

**Why use a sand wedge?**
The bounce design prevents the club from digging too deeply into the sand, allowing it to glide through and splash the ball out onto the green.

## Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

### 1. Choke Down

Position your hands lower on the grip for better control. This gives you more feel and precision for the delicate bunker shot.

---

### 2. Open Clubface

Rotate the club inside your hands before gripping to avoid instinctive repositioning during the swing.

**Important:** Open the clubface BEFORE you take your grip. If you open it after gripping, your hands will naturally want to square it at impact.

**Purpose:**
- Adds loft to help the ball get up quickly
- Engages the bounce to prevent digging
- Helps the club glide through the sand

---

### 3. Widen Stance

[Illustration: Wider stance position][images/bunker-shot-wider-stance.png]

Position your feet approximately shoulder-width or wider.

**Why?** A wider stance provides:
- Better stability in the sand
- Lower center of gravity
- More solid base for aggressive swing

---

### 4. Open Stance

Position your feet left of the target (for right-handed golfers).

**Alignment:**
- Feet and body aim left of target
- Clubface aims at target
- Creates an out-to-in swing path
- Produces higher, softer shot

---

### 5. Ball Position - Forward in Stance

Place the ball forward in your stance, targeting the sand "2" behind the ball."

**Key Points:**
- Ball forward (off front foot)
- Aim to hit sand 2 inches behind the ball
- Goal divot size: roughly the size of an American dollar bill
- This setup ensures you hit sand first, not the ball

---

### 6. Dig Feet Into Sand

Dig your feet into the sand to create a stable base.

**Benefits:**
- Provides stability during the swing
- Gives feedback about sand firmness
- Lowers your body slightly
- Prevents slipping during aggressive swing

---

## Swing Execution

### 7. Accelerate Through

Commit fully to the shot with complete follow-through and acceleration through the sand.

**Critical Point:** Deceleration in your swing can result in the ball getting stuck in the bunker.

**Mindset:**
- Be aggressive, not tentative
- Swing through the sand, not at it
- Trust the technique
- Complete your follow-through
- Think "splash" not "dig"

---

### 8. Distance Control

Vary your backswing length while maintaining full follow-through and acceleration.

**Distance Control Formula:**
- Shorter backswing = shorter shot
- Longer backswing = longer shot
- ALWAYS maintain acceleration through impact
- Follow-through should match or exceed backswing length

**Practice Tip:**
Experiment with different backswing lengths at the practice bunker to develop feel for various distances. The acceleration through impact must remain constant regardless of backswing length.

---

## Key Reminders

1. **Hit sand first** - Contact point is 2 inches behind the ball
2. **Open clubface** - Rotate club before gripping
3. **Open stance** - Aim body left of target (right-handed)
4. **Stable base** - Dig feet in, widen stance
5. **Accelerate** - Never decelerate through the sand
6. **Follow through** - Complete your swing fully
7. **Trust the bounce** - Let the sand wedge design work for you

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Hitting the ball first** - Results in thin/skulled shots across the green
- **Decelerating** - Leaves the ball in the bunker
- **Square clubface** - Causes digging and fat shots
- **Narrow stance** - Creates instability
- **Tentative swing** - Ball doesn't get out
- **No follow-through** - Inconsistent results

## Related Bunker Shot Techniques

Different bunker conditions require specific adjustments to this basic technique:

- **Wet Sand/Compact Sand** - Use lob wedge, aim 1" behind ball
- **Plugged Lies** - Square clubface, aim 3" behind ball
- **Fried-Egg Lies** - Special technique for fluffy sand craters
- **Upslope Lies** - Prevent digging behind the ball
- **Downslope Lies** - Avoid skulling shots thin
- **Long Bunker Shots** - Increase backswing length
- **Short Bunker Shots** - Use half swing with acceleration
- **Fairway Bunkers** - Different technique for distance

---

## Practice Recommendations

1. Start with the basic technique on level lies
2. Practice at a bunker with typical sand conditions
3. Draw lines in the sand 2 inches behind balls
4. Try to take consistent divots (dollar bill size)
5. Experiment with different backswing lengths
6. Build confidence before trying specialty shots
7. Always practice with acceleration and follow-through
