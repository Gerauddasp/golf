## 2. Wet Sand (Compact Sand)

**The Challenge:**
Addresses bunkers with wet or compacted sand conditions.

**Problem:**
The club can bounce from the hard surface and shoot your ball clean over the green without proper technique adjustments.

**Key Adjustments:**
- Use lob wedge instead of sand wedge
- Aim 1 inch behind ball (not 2 inches)
- More precise contact required
- Reduce bounce engagement

## 3. Plugged Lie

**The Challenge:**
Focuses on situations where your golf ball lands into a firm bunker and digs in rather than bounce off.

**Goal:**
Successfully dislodge the ball from its tricky buried location.

**Key Adjustments:**
- Square the clubface (not open)
- Aim 3 inches behind ball
- Steeper angle of attack
- Aggressive swing required
- Expect less spin and more roll

## 4. Fried-Egg Lie

**The Challenge:**
Describes scenarios where your golf ball lands into a fluffy bunker and stays inside the crater it created.

**Goal:**
Avoid hitting the ball thin or leaving the ball in the bunker.

**Key Adjustments:**
- Special setup for crater conditions
- Focus on center contact
- Manage fluffy sand texture

## 5. Upslope (Uphill)

**The Challenge:**
Covers shots where the ball lands or rolls up the side of the bunker closest to the green.

**Problem:**
Without modifications, your club will dig into the sand behind the ball and get stuck there.

**Key Adjustments:**
- Match spine angle to slope
- Ball more forward in stance
- Swing along the slope
- Expect higher trajectory
- Ball will fly shorter

## 6. Downslope (Downhill)

**The Challenge:**
Addresses balls resting up the side of the bunker farthest away from the green.

**Problem:**
Without adjustments, you risk skulling the ball thin and sending it over the green.

**Key Adjustments:**
- Match spine angle to slope
- Ball back in stance
- Swing along the slope
- Expect lower trajectory
- Ball will run more
- Most difficult bunker shot

## 7. Long Bunker Shot

**The Challenge:**
Applies when the ball sits far from the flag on a large green.

**Goal:**
Send the ball up onto the green and rolling towards the hole.

**Key Adjustments:**
- Longer backswing for distance
- Maintain acceleration
- Still hit sand first (not ball)
- May need to contact closer to ball (1.5" vs 2")
- Consider club selection (pitching wedge vs sand wedge)

## 8. Short Bunker Shot

**The Challenge:**
Focuses on situations with minimal green space between bunker and hole.

**Goal:**
Make the ball fly a short distance and land softly onto the green with minimal roll.

**Key Adjustments:**
- Shorter backswing (half swing)
- Maintain full acceleration
- Very open clubface
- Maximum loft
- Soft landing required

## 9. Fairway Bunker

**The Challenge:**
Addresses bunkers located in the fairway or beyond greenside areas.

**Important Note:**
The advice for greenside bunkers presented above do not apply since increased distance requirements change the fundamentals completely.

**Key Differences:**
- Hit ball first (not sand first)
- Use less lofted club for distance
- Clean contact essential
- Focus on getting out and advancing ball
- Club selection based on lip height
