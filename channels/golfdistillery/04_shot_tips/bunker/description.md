# Bunker Shots Overview - Quick Summary

This comprehensive overview page serves as a gateway to nine distinct bunker shot scenarios, each requiring specific technique modifications for successful execution from sand. The guide starts with the fundamental regular bunker shot that establishes core principles, then branches into specialized situations including wet/compact sand where bounce becomes critical, buried lies (plugged and fried-egg) requiring aggressive techniques, slope lies (uphill and downslope) demanding setup adjustments, distance control situations (long and short bunker shots) with varied swing lengths, and finally fairway bunkers which use completely different fundamentals focused on distance rather than height. Each bunker type links to detailed instructional pages with step-by-step guidance.
