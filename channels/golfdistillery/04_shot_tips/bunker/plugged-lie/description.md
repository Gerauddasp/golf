# Plugged Bunker Lie - Summary

A plugged lie occurs when the ball lands in a greenside bunker and digs into the sand, sitting deeper than normal. To escape this difficult situation: use a square clubface (not open) to allow the club to dig into the sand rather than bounce, grip the club tighter than usual to prevent twisting through aggressive impact, aim 3 inches behind the ball instead of the typical 2 inches, execute a full aggressive swing with complete backswing and follow-through to generate enough power to dislodge the ball, and aim short of the hole as the ball will roll considerably upon landing rather than checking or spinning back. Maintain other typical bunker setup elements including sand wedge, gripping down slightly, open stance, wide stance, digging feet in, and forward ball position.
