# Tree Trouble - Description

This page teaches golfers how to handle shots when trees block the path to the target.
It covers four essential recovery shots: punch shots under trees, draw punch shots for right-to-left curves, fade punch shots for left-to-right curves, and high shots over tall obstacles.
The focus is on creative shot-making rather than simply chipping back to the fairway.
Each technique maintains low trajectories to avoid overhanging branches or adds height to clear obstacles entirely.
These skills help limit damage and keep the ball advancing toward the green despite tree interference.
