# How to Hit a High Shot Over a Tree

## Objective

The objective when hitting a high shot over a tree is to get the ball as high as possible, as quickly as possible. This will help ensure that the ball clears the obstacle and reaches the green or your intended target.

The key is to avoid hitting the ball thin or fat, both of which will produce a low trajectory that won't clear the tree.

## How to Hit a High Shot Over a Tree

### Step 1: Use Your Most Lofted Club (Wedge)

The first step is to select your most lofted wedge – ideally a lob wedge with 56 degrees of loft or more.

Using a high-lofted club is essential because it will send the ball very high and very quickly, which is exactly what you need when trying to clear a tree. The more loft on the club, the higher and quicker the ball will get into the air.

### Step 2: Position the Ball in the Center of Your Stance

The second step is to position the ball in the center of your stance, rather than forward in your stance.

While positioning the ball forward would theoretically add loft to the club, it also invites thin shots where you catch the ball on the upswing with the leading edge of the club. It also invites fat shots where you hit the ground before the ball.

By positioning the ball in the center of your stance, you'll be more likely to make solid contact with the ball, which is crucial for producing the high trajectory you need.

### Step 3: Position Your Weight Forward

The third step is to position your weight forward, with more weight on your front foot at address.

Many golfers make the mistake of positioning their weight back when they're trying to hit the ball high. They think that leaning back will help lift the ball into the air. But this is a mistake.

Leaning back, especially combined with a forward ball position, will only encourage you to try to scoop the ball into the air with your wrists, which is a recipe for disaster. Instead, keep your weight forward to encourage solid contact.

### Step 4: Hit Down on the Ball (Trust the Loft)

The fourth and final step is to make a normal swing and hit down on the ball – trusting the loft in your club to get the ball into the air.

Don't try to help the ball into the air by scooping it or trying to lift it with your wrists. This will only result in thin or fat shots that won't clear the tree.

Instead, trust the loft on your club and make a confident, descending blow on the ball. The loft of the club will do the work of getting the ball into the air quickly and steeply.
