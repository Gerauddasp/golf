# High Shot Over a Tree - Summary

To hit a high shot over a tree, the objective is getting the ball airborne as quickly as possible. Four-step technique: (1) use your most lofted wedge (56+ degrees ideally), (2) position ball in center of stance to avoid thin/fat shots, (3) keep weight forward despite temptation to lean back, (4) make normal descending swing trusting the club's loft. Common mistakes include scooping, positioning weight back, and trying to manually lift the ball. The club's loft does the work when you hit down with solid contact.
