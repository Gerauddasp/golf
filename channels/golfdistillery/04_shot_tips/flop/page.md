## Definition

A flop shot – also known as a lob shot – is executed when a golfer hits the ball very high over a very short distance using a high lofted club, such as a lob wedge.

## Purpose

The main goal of these shots is to make the ball come to rest very close to where it landed on the green, or in other words, to make sure the ball does not roll very far after landing on the green.

## When to Use a Flop Shot

Lobs are particularly helpful when standing near the green but faced with an obstacle between the ball and the green. They are also helpful when the green speeds are particularly high and on which the ball would travel too far after landing.

## Setup Tips

Very high flop shots can call for moving your weight back. The fluffy lie gave confidence to attempt a flop shot over a bunker.

### Part of Short Game

Flop shots are one component of the short game, which encompasses shots made from inside of 100 yards to the green. A golfer with a good short game will shine when shots require finesse and precision and will be able to recover from approaches that missed the green.
