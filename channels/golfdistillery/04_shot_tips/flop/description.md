# Flop Shot - Quick Summary

A flop shot (also known as a lob shot) is executed by hitting the ball very high over a very short distance using a high-lofted club such as a lob wedge. The primary goal is to make the ball come to rest very close to where it landed on the green with minimal roll. This shot is particularly helpful when facing obstacles between the ball and the green, or when green speeds are exceptionally high and would cause the ball to roll too far after landing. Very high flop shots may require moving weight back in the stance for optimal execution.
