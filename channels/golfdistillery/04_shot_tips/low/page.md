## What is a Low Shot?

A low shot in golf – also referred to as a punch shot or stinger – is a shot that produces a ball flight that is lower than what would normally be expected with the club in hand.

Such a shot can be useful when you need to keep the ball under tree branches or when you need to keep the ball low in strong headwind conditions.

## Important Caveat

Before you attempt a low shot, you should be aware of an important caveat: don't try the shot if you need the ball to land softly and with restrained roll after landing.

Because the ball will be flying lower than normal, it will roll more than normal after it lands. So you should only attempt this shot if there are no hazards – such as bunkers – between where the ball will land and where you want it to come to rest.

## How to Hit a Low Shot

### Step 1: Use a Longer Club (Club Up)

The first step in hitting a low shot is to use a longer club than you normally would for the distance at hand.

For example, if you would normally use a 7-iron for the distance, consider using a 6-iron or even a 5-iron instead. This is because you'll be making adjustments that will reduce the distance the ball travels, and using a longer club will help compensate for this.

### Step 2: Narrow Your Stance

The second step is to narrow your stance. A narrower stance will help you control your power and make a more controlled swing.

This is important because you don't want to hit the ball too hard. A controlled swing will help ensure that the ball stays low and doesn't balloon up into the air.

### Step 3: Move the Ball Back in Your Stance

The third step is to move the ball back in your stance, positioning it towards your back foot.

Moving the ball back will effectively reduce the loft on the club at impact, which will help keep the ball flight lower. It will also encourage a steeper angle of attack, which further helps produce a lower trajectory.

### Step 4: Grip Down on the Club

The fourth step is to grip down on the club, choking down an inch or two on the grip.

Gripping down will give you more control over the club and will help you make a more controlled, compact swing. It will also effectively shorten the club, which combined with moving the ball back will help produce a lower ball flight.

### Step 5: Open Your Stance (Just a Little)

The fifth step is to open your stance just a little, rotating your feet slightly to the left (for right-handed golfers).

Opening your stance slightly will help compensate for the fact that you've moved the ball back in your stance. It will help ensure that the clubface is square to the target at impact, rather than being closed which could occur from having the ball too far back.

### Step 6: Position Your Weight Forward

The sixth step is to position more of your weight on your front foot at address, and to keep it there throughout the swing.

Keeping your weight forward will encourage a steeper angle of attack and help ensure that you make contact with the ball before the ground. This will help produce a penetrating, low ball flight.

### Step 7: Press Your Hands Forward (at Impact)

The seventh step is to press your hands forward at impact, positioning them ahead of the ball.

This forward hand position is crucial for producing a low shot. It delofts the club even further and helps ensure that you're hitting down on the ball with a descending blow. The hands should lead the clubhead through impact.

### Step 8: Restrain Your Follow Through

The eighth step is to restrain your follow through, keeping it shorter and more compact than normal.

A full, complete follow through would tend to produce a higher ball flight. By keeping your follow through shorter, you'll help ensure that the ball stays low. Focus on keeping your hands low through the follow through.

### Step 9: Expect the Ball to Roll More

Finally, you should expect the ball to roll more than normal after it lands.

Because the ball is flying lower with less backspin, it will not stop as quickly as a normal shot. You need to factor this into your distance calculations and ensure there are no hazards between your intended landing spot and where the ball will come to rest.
