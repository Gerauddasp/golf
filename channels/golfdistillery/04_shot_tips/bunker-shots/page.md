This section offers tips on how to hit golf shots from sand bunkers. While all bunker shot tips offered here deal with situations where the ball sits on top of sand the various lies call for tweaks to your setup and swing in order to be successful.

**Start Here!**

The basics to the typical bunker shots are covered and a lot of the tips will apply to the other types of bunker shots that follow below.

## Wet Sand / Compact Sand

Your bunker shot came to rest in wet or otherwise compact sand and you need to adjust your execution to make sure you don't see the club bounce from the hard surface and shoot your ball clean over the green.

## Plugged Lie

Your golf ball lands into a firm bunker and digs in rather than bounce off the sand surface. Review the tips to successfully dislodge the ball from its tricky location.

## Fried-Egg Lie

A ball lands in a fluffy bunker and stays inside the crater that was created at impact. Adjustments will be necessary to avoid hitting the ball thin or leaving the ball in the bunker.

## Upslope / Uphill

Your ball comes to rest up the side of the bunker closest to the green and you will need to make tweaks to your address position to avoid seeing your club dig into the sand behind the ball.

## Downslope / Downhill

Your ball comes to rest on the side of the bunker farthest away from the green and you'll need to adjust your setup and swing in order to prevent skulling the ball thin and sending it over the green, or straight into the lip.

## Long Bunker Shots

Your golf ball comes to rest in a greenside bunker that is located far away from the flag and you'll need to execute bunker shot swing that is designed to send the ball up onto the green and rolling towards the hole.

## Short Bunker Shots

Your golf ball comes to rest in a greenside bunker that is located closest to the flag and you have little green to work with. You'll need to execute a short bunker shot that will make the ball fly a short distance and land softly onto the green.

## Fairway Bunker

Sand bunkers are not confined to the area next to the green and can be found elsewhere on a golf course, including in front of tees, in the fairways, in the rough and even on top of hills. The advice for greenside bunkers outlined above do not apply to fairway bunkers as the increased distance to the green changes the situation fundamentally.
