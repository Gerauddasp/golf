# Bump and Run Shot (Chip and Run)

## Definition

For a bump and run shot, the golfer will hit the ball in such a way as to make it hop a short distance before rolling a good distance afterwards. Such a shot is executed when golfers find themselves a short distance away from the green, with no trouble areas in the ball's trajectory after it is meant to land.

## When to Use

This type of shot is particularly useful when:
- Standing a short distance from the green
- No obstacles or trouble areas are in the ball's path after landing
- The ground conditions favor rolling the ball

## Air-to-Roll Ratios by Club

Understanding how different clubs affect the air-to-roll ratio is crucial for executing effective bump and run shots:

### 7-Iron
- **Ratio:** Approximately 20% air, 80% roll (20-80)
- **Marker placement:** At one-quarter to one-fifth of total distance
- **Best for:** Maximum roll with minimal flight

### Pitching Wedge
- **Ratio:** Approximately 50% air, 50% roll (50-50)
- **Marker placement:** At halfway distance to the hole
- **Best for:** Balanced flight and roll

### Lob Wedge
- **Ratio:** Approximately 80% air, 20% roll (80-20)
- **Marker placement:** At 75-80% of total distance
- **Best for:** More flight with minimal roll

## Practice Drill: Find Your Air-to-Roll Ratios

**What you need:**
- 7-iron, pitching wedge, and lob wedge
- Several golf balls
- A marker or tee
- Access to practice green

**Instructions:**

1. Drop balls just off the putting surface
2. Place a marker at the halfway distance to the hole
3. Hit pitching wedge shots aiming for the midway marker
4. Note where the ball comes to rest relative to the hole
5. Move marker to one-quarter to one-fifth distance and practice with 7-iron
6. Move marker to 75-80% distance and practice with lob wedge
7. Observe and memorize the different ratios for each club

## Get the Ball Rolling As Soon As You Can

Sometimes the right chip shot isn't always to get the ball airborne for as long as possible so that it lands as close to the pin as possible. Knowing your air-to-roll ratios will help you determine the club you should be hitting in order to hit a bump-and-run that rolls up to within gimme range of the hole.
