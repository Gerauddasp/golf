# Shot Shaping - Description

This section teaches golfers how to intentionally shape their ball flight to navigate course obstacles and manage different conditions.
It covers three essential shot shapes: the draw (right-to-left with more roll), the fade (left-to-right with soft landing), and the stinger/low shot (penetrating flight for wind).
Each technique includes detailed step-by-step instructions with visual diagrams showing proper setup, stance, clubface position, and swing path adjustments.
The content emphasizes the relationship between clubface angle, stance alignment, and swing path to produce the desired ball flight characteristics.
These skills allow golfers to work the ball around hazards, counteract wind, and attack specific pin positions with controlled shot trajectories.
