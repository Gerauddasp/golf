# Pitch Shot

## Definition

A pitch shot is a type of approach shot executed when a golfer uses a high-lofted club to hit the ball high in order to have it land softly on the green. This shot is characterized by its high trajectory and soft landing, allowing the ball to stop quickly upon contact with the putting surface.

## Club Selection

Pitch shots are traditionally performed using a pitching wedge (approximately 48° loft), though other high-lofted wedges can be used as alternatives depending on distance and desired trajectory.

## When to Use a Pitch Shot

The pitch shot is ideal in several situations:

- Approaching the green from 30-100 yards
- When obstacles (bunkers, rough, water) stand between you and the green
- When the pin is positioned close to your side of the green with limited landing area
- When you need the ball to stop quickly after landing
- On softer greens that allow for aggressive approach shots

## Pitch and Run Variation

A modified version of the standard pitch shot where the golfer restricts elevation so the ball lands sooner and rolls further toward the target. This variation is particularly useful in:

- Very windy conditions where a high trajectory becomes difficult to control
- Hard ground surfaces (like Scottish links courses) where the ball bounces and rolls rather than stopping near the landing point
- Situations where rolling the ball to the pin provides more control than a full aerial approach

## Key Differences from Other Short Game Shots

Understanding how the pitch shot differs from similar shots helps in shot selection:

- **Pitch vs. Chip**: A chip shot uses a shorter swing motion from very close range and often resembles a putting stroke, while a pitch requires a fuller swing and produces more height
- **Pitch vs. Flop/Lob**: A flop or lob shot achieves maximum height over minimal distance with the ball stopping almost immediately, while a standard pitch balances height with distance
- **Pitch vs. Bump and Run**: A bump and run features a low hop followed by extended rolling and is used when no obstacles exist, while a pitch flies higher and rolls less

## Basic Technique

While Golf Distillery's detailed pitch shot technique page is not available, the fundamental approach involves:

- Using a high-lofted club (pitching wedge or higher)
- Creating a swing that produces sufficient loft for the ball to fly high
- Landing the ball on the green where it can stop quickly
- Adjusting swing length to control distance rather than swing speed
