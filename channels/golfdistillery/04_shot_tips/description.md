Difficult Lies addresses techniques for handling imperfect conditions like rough, tight lies, slopes, and uneven stances.
Tree Trouble provides escape strategies including punch shots (straight, draw, fade variations) and high shots over obstacles.
Bunker Shots covers comprehensive sand play from basic greenside technique through challenging conditions (wet sand, plugged lies, fried eggs) and slope variations.
