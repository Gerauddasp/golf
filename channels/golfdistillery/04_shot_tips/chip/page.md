# Chip Shot

## What is a Chip Shot?

A chip shot is executed when a golfer's ball is located on grass and close to the green. Golfers will usually use a high lofted club – such as a wedge – to pop the ball onto the green from where it will roll, ideally towards the hole.

Chip shots are part of the short game, typically performed from within 100 yards of the green, and often much closer.

## Key Characteristics

### Distance and Proximity

Chip shots are performed when you're very close to the green but not quite on the putting surface. The ball sits on grass (not sand or rough terrain) within easy striking distance.

### Swing Motion

Because golfers are situated so near the green when performing a chip, the swing motion is restricted to that of a very short shot. The motion of a chip can even resemble that of a putt, emphasizing simplicity and control over power.

### Club Selection

Golfers typically use **high-lofted clubs such as wedges** for chip shots. Common choices include:
- Pitching wedge
- Sand wedge
- Gap wedge
- Lob wedge

The exact club selection depends on:
- Distance to the hole
- Amount of green to work with
- Obstacles between ball and pin
- Desired air-to-roll ratio

## The Objective

The primary goal of a chip shot is to get the ball onto the green with minimal swing effort, allowing it to roll toward the hole. A successful chip leaves you with an easy putt, ideally within "gimme" range.

## Chip Shot Variations

### Chip-In

A chip-in occurs when the ball will travel towards the hole and fall in it after being struck. This is the ideal outcome, eliminating the need for a subsequent putt and often resulting in saving par or even making birdie.

### Chip and Run (Bump and Run)

For this variation, the golfer will hit the ball in such a way as to make it hop a short distance before rolling a good distance afterwards. This approach works well when:
- No obstacles exist between your ball and the green
- You have plenty of green to work with
- The green slopes toward the hole
- Conditions are firm and fast

The chip-and-run emphasizes rolling distance over air time, often using a less-lofted club like a 7-iron or 8-iron to keep the ball low.

## Understanding Up-and-Down

A golfer is said to perform an up-and-down when he executes a two shot sequence of a chip followed by a putt that sends the ball into the hole. This is the standard goal when you've missed the green – get "up" onto the green with your chip, then "down" into the hole with one putt.

## How Chip Shots Differ from Other Short Game Shots

### Chip Shot vs. Pitch Shot

While both chip shots and pitch shots use lofted clubs near the green, they have distinct characteristics:

**Chip Shot:**
- Lower trajectory
- More rolling distance after landing
- Resembles a putting motion
- Used when you have green to work with

**Pitch Shot:**
- Higher trajectory
- Ball lands softly with minimal roll
- Fuller swing motion
- Used to carry obstacles or stop quickly

### Chip Shot vs. Flop Shot

**Chip Shot:**
- Moderate height
- Significant roll after landing
- Controlled, simple motion

**Flop Shot:**
- Very high trajectory over very short distance
- Minimal roll, maximum air time
- More complex technique
- Used to clear close obstacles with little green to work with

### Chip Shot vs. Bunker Shot

**Chip Shot:**
- Ball on grass
- Club strikes ball cleanly
- Predictable roll

**Bunker Shot:**
- Ball in sand
- Club enters sand behind ball
- Less predictable outcome

## When to Use a Chip Shot

Choose a chip shot when:
- Your ball is on grass just off the green (fringe, first cut, light rough)
- You have a clear path to the putting surface
- You don't need to carry significant obstacles
- The green slopes in your favor or is relatively flat
- You want a simple, reliable shot with predictable roll

## Summary

The chip shot is one of golf's most important shots for scoring. Its simple, putting-like motion makes it relatively easy to execute consistently with practice. By understanding when to use a chip shot versus other short game options, and by practicing the fundamental technique, golfers can dramatically improve their up-and-down percentage and lower their scores.

Remember: the goal isn't always to hole the chip (though that's wonderful when it happens). The goal is to leave yourself an easy putt so you can save par or convert birdie opportunities when you miss the green.
