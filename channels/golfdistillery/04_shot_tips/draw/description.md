# Draw Shot - Summary

A draw is a controlled shot where the ball starts right of target (for right-handed golfers) and curves left to finish on target. To execute: (1) open the clubface slightly right, (2) close your stance so it points right of the clubface, (3) swing along your body line creating an inside-out path, (4) expect lower flight and more roll. The closed clubface relative to swing path creates draw spin while reducing effective loft. Use draws to work with natural tendencies, navigate obstacles, manage wind, or approach greens from specific angles.
