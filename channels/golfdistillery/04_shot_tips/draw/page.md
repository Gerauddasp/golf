## What is a Draw?

In golf a draw – or draw shot – is the name of the trajectory that sees the ball starting outside of the target line after impact but curling in and finishing at the target. In other words, for a golfer that is using a normal stance, the ball will start right of the target and will curve back to the left.

For a right-handed golfer, a draw will see the ball starting its trajectory right of the target and curling back to the left as it drops. For a left-handed golfer, it will see the ball starting left of the target and curling back to the right.

In contrast to a slice, a draw is not a shot error. A draw represents a controlled shot in which the golfer expects the ball to move right-to-left (for right-handed golfers) and finish at the target.

## When Should You Try to Draw the Ball?

You should consider trying to draw the ball when:

- You have a natural tendency to draw the ball and seek to work with – rather than against – your natural ball flight
- You need to curve the ball around an obstacle such as a tree or water hazard
- You are playing in windy conditions and need to control ball flight
- You want to approach the green from a specific angle that favors a draw trajectory

## How to Draw the Ball

### Step 1: Open the Clubface (just a little) to the Right

The first step in hitting a draw is to open the clubface slightly to the right of your target. This is because the ball needs to start its trajectory to the right before it can curve back to the left.

Modern ball flight laws have shown that the clubface is the main factor in determining the initial direction of the ball after impact. So in order for the ball to start right, the clubface needs to be pointing right at the moment of impact.

### Step 2: Close Your Stance

The second step is to close your stance. To do so, rotate your feet to the right until your stance line crosses the clubface line.

This is necessary because you'll want the clubface to be closed relative to the swing path. And since you'll be swinging along your body line in the next step, you'll need to set up your body so that it's pointing to the right of the clubface.

### Step 3: Swing Inside-Out (Along Your Feet)

The third step is to swing along your body line, which will see you swing from inside-to-out relative to the target line.

Don't try to compensate for your closed stance by swinging back toward the target. Instead, swing along your feet line, which should see you swinging to the right of the target.

### Step 4: Expect a Lower Ball Flight and More Roll

Finally, you should expect the ball to fly lower than normal and to roll more once it lands.

This is because the clubface will be closed relative to the swing path, which effectively reduces the loft on the club. Less loft means a lower ball flight, and a lower ball flight combined with the draw spin will result in more roll after the ball lands.
