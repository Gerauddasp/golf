## Common Issues Found

### Most Common: Missing Image Documentation (40+ pages)
Images exist and are properly referenced in page.md, but not documented in metadata.md. This is the easiest fix - just update metadata files to list images.

### URL Mismatches (6 pages)
Pages have wrong URLs in metadata.md pointing to different Golf Distillery content:
- grip-pressure (has swing-thoughts URL)
- hands-behind-the-ball (has tweaks URL)
- club-resting-on-ground (has tweaks URL)
- shoulder-tilt (has spine-angle URL)
- weak-grip (has tweaks URL)
- pitch (has club definition URL)

### Content Mismatches (2 pages)
Wrong content transcribed entirely:
- chip (contains drills content instead of tips)
- pitch (contains club definition instead of shot technique)

### Missing Pages (13 pages)
Pages not yet transcribed:
- top-of-swing
- 7 difficult lies pages (low-shot, heavy-rough, fluffy-rough, tall-grass, tight-lie, ball-above-feet, ball-below-feet, downslope)
- 4 bunker pages (short-bunker invalid URL, upslope-bunker, plugged-bunker)

### Extra Files (3 pages)
Pages with 14-16 unused badge/ebook images:
- shaft-angle (15 extra files)
- shoulder-tilt (14 extra files)
- spine-angle (16 extra files)

### Incorrect Image Syntax (2 pages)
- takeaway (uses `[alt][images/file]` instead of `![alt](images/file)`)
- downswing-drills (uses reference-style instead of inline)

### Insufficient Structure (1 page)
- weak-grip (only 1 H2 heading, needs 2+)

---

## Next Steps

### High Priority Fixes (Can fix quickly)
1. Update metadata.md files to document images (40+ pages)
2. Fix URL mismatches in metadata.md (6 pages)
3. Fix image syntax (2 pages)

### Medium Priority
4. Clean up extra files (3 pages)
5. Fix content mismatches (2 pages need re-transcription)
6. Add more H2 headings to weak-grip

### Low Priority (Requires new transcriptions)
7. Transcribe 13 missing pages
8. Transcribe top-of-swing page
