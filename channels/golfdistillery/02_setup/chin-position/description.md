# Chin Position - Description

Explains proper chin positioning at address to optimize shoulder rotation during the golf swing.
Contrasts "chin-in" position (bad - limits shoulder rotation) versus "chin-out" position (good - frees shoulders).
Recommends extending chin away from body so face is nearly perpendicular to ground.
This allows looking down at ball through eyes rather than rotating head to face ball.
Proper chin position enables shoulders to rotate independently from neck and head for unrestricted swing movement.
