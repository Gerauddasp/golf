# Knee Flex - Summary

The amount of flex to set in your knees represents another key aspect of a proper golf setup.

Excessive knee bending creates several problems, shifting weight toward the back of the feet rather than the center, and can cause inconsistency through the swing.

Standing too tall shifts weight toward the toes, but minimal variance in knee flex helps maintain level positioning throughout the swing.

The recommended athletic position features moderate knee flex with weight centered in the middle of feet, arms perpendicular to ground, and adequate space between knees and hands.

This balanced approach provides stable positioning while remaining easy to replicate, supporting overall swing consistency.
