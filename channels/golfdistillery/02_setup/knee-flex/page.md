The amount of flex to set in your knees represents another key aspect of a proper golf setup.

## Too Much Knee Bend

Excessive knee bending creates several problems. When golfers drop too low, their knees close to their hands, which they will need to extend out to avoid collision. This positioning shifts weight toward the back of the feet rather than the center.

Additionally, excessive initial flexion can cause inconsistency through the swing, potentially leading to standing up at impact—a common error.

## Too Little Knee Bend

Standing too tall presents different issues. Weight tends to migrate toward the toes instead of the middle of the feet.

However, this approach offers benefits: minimal variance in knee flex helps maintain level positioning throughout the swing. The tradeoff exists between fat shots and thin shots—tall stances reduce fat shot risk but increase thin shot vulnerability.

## The Ideal Position

The article recommends an athletic position with moderate knee flex. Proper setup should feature:

- Knees flexed slightly
- Weight centered in the middle of feet
- Arms perpendicular to ground
- Adequate space between knees and hands
- Improved stability and balance
- Enhanced consistency and repeatability

This middle ground provides quite stable positioning while remaining easy to replicate, supporting overall swing consistency.
