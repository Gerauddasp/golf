# Ball Back in Stance Summary

Ball back position places the ball closer to your right foot (for right-handed golfers), reducing club loft and promoting earlier contact in the downswing. This setup produces lower, penetrating ball flight ideal for headwinds and clearing low obstacles. While reducing fat shots, it increases topped shot risk and tends to push the ball slightly right.
