# Ball in the Center of Stance Summary

Center ball position places the ball equidistant from both feet, creating a neutral setup. This positioning maintains the club's designed loft and promotes balanced contact at a natural point in the swing arc. The result is standard trajectory and consistent ball striking - ideal for mid-irons and as a baseline for position adjustments.
