# Gripping Down on the Shaft - Description

Technique of positioning hands lower on the grip or even onto bare shaft, effectively shortening the club and changing its characteristics.
Reduces distance and clubhead speed but provides greater control and precision, especially valuable for delicate shots.
Creates stiffer shaft behavior with less whipping motion, producing lower, more penetrating ball flight trajectory.
Facilitates thin contact by preventing deep ground penetration, crucial for fairway bunker shots and tight lies.
Ideal for chip shots around green, control approaches, and any situation prioritizing accuracy over maximum distance.
