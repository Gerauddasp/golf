# Club at Full Length (Hands at Top of Grip)

## Overview

When a golfer grips the club at the top of the grip (full length position), they maximize the distance between their body and the clubhead, utilizing the club's full designed length.

## Hand Position

In this standard setup, the golfer's hands are positioned at the top of the grip, with the club at its full manufactured length. This is the default position for most full swing shots.

## Effects of Full Length Position

### Maximum Distance Generation

The further away a golfer is the more energy will be generated by the club.

Using the club at full length maximizes clubhead speed and distance potential because:
- Greater arc radius creates more clubhead speed
- Maximum leverage from the shaft
- Full whipping motion of the shaft during swing
- Optimal energy transfer to the ball

### Standard Shaft Flex

At full length, the shaft performs with its designed flex characteristics:
- Normal whipping motion through impact
- Standard ball flight trajectory
- Manufacturer-intended shaft behavior

### Ground Interaction

At full length, the club:
- Sits naturally at its designed lie angle
- Allows normal ground interaction
- Permits proper divot taking with irons
- Enables standard shot execution

## When to Use Full Length

This position is appropriate for:
- **Driver shots**: Maximum distance off the tee
- **Full swing iron shots**: Standard approach shots
- **Fairway wood shots**: When distance is priority
- **Any shot prioritizing distance**: Where maximum power is needed
- **Standard lies**: When ball sits normally on turf

## Characteristics

- **Distance**: Maximum distance and clubhead speed
- **Control**: Standard control (less than gripping down)
- **Shaft Flex**: Normal shaft whipping and flex
- **Ball Flight**: Standard trajectory for the club
- **Typical Uses**: All standard full swing shots

## Comparison to Gripping Down

Unlike gripping down the shaft (club raised from ground position), full length provides:
- More distance and clubhead speed
- Less control and precision
- Normal shaft flex (not stiffened)
- Standard ground interaction
- Maximum leverage and power

## Club Lie at Address

When using full grip length, ensure that the sole of the club rests flatly on the ground at address. This confirms proper:
- Club fitting for your height and posture
- Distance from the ball
- Setup position
- Lie angle for your swing
