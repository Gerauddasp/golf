# Club at Full Length - Description

Standard grip position with hands at top of grip, utilizing club's full manufactured length for maximum distance potential.
Maximizes clubhead speed and energy generation due to greater arc radius and full shaft leverage.
Shaft performs with designed flex characteristics, allowing normal whipping motion and standard ball flight trajectory.
Appropriate for all standard full swing shots including driver, woods, and irons where distance is priority.
Provides maximum power but less control compared to gripping down, with club sole resting naturally flat on ground at address.
