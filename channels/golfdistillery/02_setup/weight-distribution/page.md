# Adjusting the Weight Distribution Across your Feet in Golf

This Golf Distillery article explains how to adjust weight distribution across your feet during the golf setup, a key component of proper golf technique.

## Evenly Distributed (50/50)

The standard approach calls for equal weight distribution between both feet at address, regardless of ball position in the stance, maintaining balanced support during most normal shots.

## Weight Forward

Moving weight toward the front (left) foot involves sliding hips forward. This creates several effects:

- Increases the shaft lean of your club
- Promotes ball trapping and cleaner contact
- Creates downward strike on the ball
- Reduces club loft slightly, creating lower ball flight
- Commonly used for chip shots and delicate short-game work

## Weight Backward

Positioning weight toward the back (right) foot by sliding hips backward creates these effects:

- Decreases shaft lean
- Increases effective club loft
- Produces higher ball flights
- Used less frequently, but helpful for:
  - Fairway bunker shots near lips
  - Shots over obstructions
  - Very high flop shots

The article notes this setup is often done in error rather than in trying to hit a specific shot.

## Key Principle

Weight distribution directly influences shaft lean, club loft, ball flight trajectory, and contact quality without requiring ball position changes.
