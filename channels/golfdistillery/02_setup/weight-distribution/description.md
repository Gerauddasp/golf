# Weight Distribution - Summary

This Golf Distillery article explains three weight distribution approaches at address to optimize ball striking and trajectory.

The standard approach calls for equal weight distribution between both feet (50/50), maintaining balanced support during most normal shots.

Moving weight forward onto the front foot increases shaft lean, promotes cleaner contact and downward strike, and produces lower ball flights ideal for chip shots and delicate short-game work.

Positioning weight backward onto the back foot decreases shaft lean, increases loft, and produces higher ball flights useful for fairway bunker shots near lips or very high flop shots, though this is often done in error.

Weight distribution directly influences shaft lean, club loft, ball flight trajectory, and contact quality without requiring ball position changes.
