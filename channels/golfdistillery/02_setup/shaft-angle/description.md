# Shaft Angle - Summary

This article explains three hand positions relative to the ball at address and their effects on shaft lean and ball flight.

Positive shaft lean (hands ahead of ball) is generally recommended in golf, used by professionals to compress the ball, create downward strike, reduce loft, and produce lower ball flight with solid contact.

Zero shaft lean (hands level with ball) creates a 90-degree shaft angle that feels natural but doesn't create optimal conditions for most iron shots, though it can work in certain situations.

Negative shaft lean (hands behind ball) promotes hitting up on the ball, increases effective loft, produces higher flights, and is commonly used for driver setups or specialty shots requiring additional height.

The position of your hands relative to the ball at address directly affects shaft lean, which in turn influences launch angle, trajectory, and contact quality throughout the swing.
