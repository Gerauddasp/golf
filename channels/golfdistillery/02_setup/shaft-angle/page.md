# Impacts of Shaft Lean Tweaks

This article explains three hand positions relative to the ball at address and how they affect your golf shots.

## Positive Shaft Lean – Hands ahead of the ball

Hands positioned forward of the ball, creating an acute angle between shaft and ground. This approach is generally recommended in golf and is used by professional golfers to compress the ball and promote solid contact.

### Effects of Positive Shaft Lean:
- Promotes compressing the ball
- Creates downward strike
- Reduces effective loft
- Produces lower ball flight
- Encourages ball-first contact

This is the preferred setup position for most iron and wedge shots.

## Zero Shaft Lean – Hands level with the ball

Hands aligned directly above the ball at a 90-degree angle. The article notes this position is quite natural but doesn't create optimal conditions for ball flight.

### Characteristics of Zero Shaft Lean:
- Most natural hand position
- Shaft perpendicular to ground
- Standard loft at address
- Less optimal for iron play
- Can work for certain situations

## Negative Shaft Lean – Hands behind the ball

Hands positioned behind the ball, creating an open shaft angle. This setup promotes hitting up on the ball and is sometimes used for forward ball positions like drives.

### Effects of Negative Shaft Lean:
- Promotes hitting up on the ball
- Increases effective loft
- Produces higher ball flight
- Common for driver setups
- Useful for specialty shots requiring height

## Key Principle

The position of your hands relative to the ball at address directly affects shaft lean, which in turn influences launch angle, trajectory, and contact quality.
