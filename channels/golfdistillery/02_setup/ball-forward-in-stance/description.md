# Ball Forward in Stance Summary

Ball forward position places the ball closer to your left foot (for right-handed golfers), increasing club loft and promoting later contact in the downswing. This setup produces higher, softer-landing ball flight ideal for drivers, clearing obstacles, and bunker shots. While reducing topped shots, it increases fat shot risk and tends to pull the ball slightly left.
