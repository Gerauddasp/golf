# Distance to the Ball - Description

Specific method for determining correct distance to golf ball at address for each club.
Step 1: Lock knees straight - weight shifts toward heels.
Step 2: Flex knees slightly until weight balances over center of feet - that's proper knee flex.
Step 3: Lower club onto front thigh - should touch about 1 inch above kneecap.
Emphasizes adjusting distance by moving feet closer/farther, not by changing leg flex.
Distance varies by club length - develops naturally over time but method provides checkpoint.
