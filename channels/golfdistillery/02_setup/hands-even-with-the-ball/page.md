# Zero Shaft Lean (Hands Even with the Ball)

## Overview

This position places hands in line with the ball, directly above it and in doing so creating a shaft that crosses the ground at a 90 degree angle. It's natural but suboptimal.

## Characteristics

In the zero shaft lean position, the golfer's hands are positioned directly above the ball at address, creating a perpendicular angle between the club shaft and the ground.

## Drawbacks

The problem with this setup is that it doesn't create the optimal conditions for the ball to be sent forward with all the vigor it should.

This hand position is characteristic of amateur golfers who don't deliberately position their hands for optimal ball striking.

## Key Characteristics

- **Hand Position**: Hands directly above the ball at address
- **Shaft Angle**: 90-degree angle between shaft and ground (perpendicular)
- **Ball Contact**: Neutral contact, neither hitting down nor up
- **Ball Flight**: Less than optimal distance and compression
- **Typical Users**: Amateur golfers using natural, unconsidered setup

## Issues with This Position

While this position feels natural and comfortable, it fails to:
- Maximize ball compression
- Create optimal launch conditions
- Generate the power and distance available from proper forward lean
- Produce the pure ball flight achieved by professionals

## Who Uses This

This setup position is common among amateur golfers who haven't learned to deliberately position their hands forward at address. It represents a natural, instinctive hand position rather than a trained, optimal one.

## Improvement Path

Golfers using zero shaft lean should work toward developing positive shaft lean (hands ahead of the ball) to achieve better ball compression and more consistent, powerful ball striking.
