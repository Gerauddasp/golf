# Hands Even with the Ball - Description

Zero shaft lean setup position where hands are positioned directly above the ball at address, creating a 90-degree angle between shaft and ground.
This natural-feeling position fails to create optimal conditions for ball compression and distance.
Characteristic of amateur golfers who don't deliberately position their hands for maximum effectiveness.
While comfortable and instinctive, it produces less vigorous ball flight than positive shaft lean.
Represents a suboptimal setup that should be corrected toward forward hand position for better results.
