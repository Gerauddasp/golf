# Spine Angle - How Should you Set your Spine at Address in Golf

The article explains three dimensions of spine positioning at address that work together to create proper posture.

## 1. Forward Tilt of Upper Body

The spine angle is determined by how much you bend forward, which is related to knee flex. The guidance suggests a middle ground approach—not standing too tall (Ben Hogan's stool position) nor bending excessively forward.

### The Optimal Forward Bend

A normal forward bend allows you to position your club behind the ball at address comfortably using both knee flex and forward tilt. This position:

- Stacks body weight along a central axis to the middle of your feet
- Is generally recommended as the default position
- Provides stability and balance
- Allows comfortable rotation

## 2. Spine Pattern Shape

Three spine patterns are discussed in the article:

### C-Shape Spine

Rounded back (suboptimal). This pattern:
- Creates a curved, hunched posture
- Hinders efficient rotation
- Places stress on the back
- Should be avoided

### S-Shape Spine

Exaggerated buttocks position (problematic). This pattern:
- Creates excessive arch in lower back
- Places weight burden on lower back
- Can lead to discomfort and injury
- Not recommended

### Straight Pattern Spine

Neutral spine with no curve (optimal). This pattern:
- Allows comfortable rotation along your axis
- Distributes weight appropriately at hips
- Maintains natural spine alignment
- Is the recommended spine shape

Only the Straight Line pattern is optimal as it allows comfortable rotation along your axis.

## 3. Shoulder Height Alignment (Sideways Tilt)

This involves side tilt of the spine, visible through shoulder alignment and the height of one shoulder relative to the other.

### Level Shoulders

Creating level shoulders requires twisting the spine. This is generally avoided except for delicate shots requiring precise control.

### Back Shoulder Too Low

If the right shoulder drops too low relative to the left:
- Makes hitting down on the ball close to impossible
- Can lead to fat shots
- Risky when this setup creeps into regular iron and wedge play
- Sometimes taught for drives (hit on upswing) but problematic otherwise

### Correct Shoulder Position

The right shoulder should naturally stand lower and closer to the ground because your right hand will be positioned lower on the grip than the left at address. This natural tilt:
- Follows proper hand positioning
- Avoids excessive spine twist
- Promotes proper swing mechanics
- Should not be exaggerated

An ideal spinal side tilt naturally follows how your hands are positioned on the club.

## Central Principle

Proper spine setup enables efficient rotation and distributes body weight appropriately. The better the position and angle of your spine at address, the better it will be throughout the swing, especially at impact.

The spine angle set at address should be kept intact through the backswing, downswing, and impact, in contrast to allowing it to alter during the swing.
