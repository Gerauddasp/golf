# Spine Angle and Shoulder Tilt - Summary

This article explains three dimensions of spine positioning at address: forward tilt, spine pattern shape, and shoulder height alignment (sideways tilt).

Forward tilt should be a middle ground—not too tall nor bent over excessively—with a normal forward bend allowing comfortable club positioning while stacking body weight along a central axis to the middle of your feet.

Spine pattern shape has three variations (C-Shape rounded back, S-Shape exaggerated arch, Straight neutral), with only the Straight Line pattern being optimal as it allows comfortable rotation and distributes weight appropriately at the hips.

Shoulder height alignment involves natural sideways spine tilt where the right shoulder stands lower to match the right hand's lower grip position, avoiding both level shoulders (which twist the spine) and excessively low back shoulder (which prevents hitting down).

Proper spine setup enables efficient rotation and weight distribution, with the spine angle set at address maintained intact through the backswing, downswing, and impact for optimal ball striking.
