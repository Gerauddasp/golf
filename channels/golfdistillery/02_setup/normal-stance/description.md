Normal stance positions feet shoulder-width apart, creating a balanced athletic base. This versatile setup allows full hip rotation while maintaining adequate stability for most shots. The moderate center of gravity works with all clubs and conditions - making it the ideal default stance for consistent, repeatable golf.
