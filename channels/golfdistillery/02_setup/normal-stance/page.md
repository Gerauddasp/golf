# Normal Stance

## Definition

A normal stance is the default foot positioning where the distance between your feet matches the width of your shoulders. This athletic baseline works for most standard golf shots.

## How to Set Up a Normal Stance

To establish a normal stance width:

1. **Stand naturally** - Begin in a relaxed, athletic posture
2. **Measure shoulder width** - Note the distance from outside of one shoulder to the outside of the other
3. **Match with feet** - Position your feet so the inside edges are approximately shoulder-width apart
4. **Check balance** - You should feel stable and athletic

Alternative method:
1. **Jump test** - Jump slightly off the ground
2. **Natural landing** - Notice where your feet naturally land
3. **That's your width** - This natural position is typically close to ideal stance width

## Characteristics of Normal Stance

### Balanced Center of Gravity

With normal stance width:
- Center of gravity at optimal athletic height
- Neither too high nor too low
- Natural balance and stability
- Ready position for athletic movement

### Versatile Foundation

Normal stance provides:
- Suitable for most clubs and shots
- Good balance of stability and mobility
- Allows proper hip rotation
- Enables full shoulder turn
- Works for variety of swing types

## Effects on Swing

### Rotation Capability

Normal stance allows:
- **Full hip rotation** - Neither restricted nor excessive
- **Complete shoulder turn** - Natural coiling motion
- **Balanced weight shift** - Proper transfer from back to front
- **Athletic motion** - Unrestricted swing movement

### Stability

Normal stance provides:
- **Adequate stability** - Enough base for controlled swing
- **Not excessive** - Doesn't restrict movement
- **Wind resistance** - Sufficient for normal conditions
- **Slope management** - Works on level lies

## Ball Flight Characteristics

With normal stance, expect:
- **Standard trajectory**: Club performs as designed
- **Neutral arc height**: Neither artificially low nor high
- **Consistent contact**: Repeatable strike pattern
- **Predictable results**: Reliable ball flight
- **Full distance**: Maximum efficiency for that club

## When to Use Normal Stance

Normal stance is appropriate for:
- **Most golf shots**: Your default width for general play
- **Standard conditions**: Level lies in calm weather
- **All clubs**: Works with driver through wedges
- **Full swings**: Complete backswing and follow-through
- **Learning fundamentals**: Building consistent technique
- **Practice sessions**: Developing repeatable mechanics

## Common Clubs for Normal Stance

### Driver and Woods
- Full swing requires stable base
- Normal width provides good balance
- Allows complete rotation
- Standard setup for tee shots

### Mid to Long Irons
- 3-iron through 7-iron
- Full swing motion
- Balanced weight transfer
- Normal width is ideal

### Short Irons
- 8-iron through pitching wedge
- Full to three-quarter swings
- Normal width as baseline
- May narrow slightly for softer shots

### Hybrids and Utilities
- Versatile clubs benefit from normal stance
- Balanced setup for various shot types
- Standard width works well

## Comparison to Wide Stance

Unlike wide stance which:
- Lowers center of gravity more
- Increases stability significantly
- May restrict hip rotation
- Better for wind and slopes

Normal stance:
- Moderate center of gravity
- Balanced stability
- Unrestricted rotation
- Versatile for all conditions

## Comparison to Narrow Stance

Unlike narrow stance which:
- Raises center of gravity
- Reduces stability
- Facilitates easier rotation
- Better for shorter clubs/swings

Normal stance:
- Moderate center of gravity
- Better stability
- Balanced rotation
- More versatile overall

## Comparison to Very Narrow Stance

Unlike very narrow stance which:
- Maximally raises center of gravity
- Minimal stability
- Reserved for tiny swings
- Only for delicate shots

Normal stance:
- Moderate center of gravity
- Good stability
- Full swing capability
- Standard shot application

## Benefits of Normal Stance

### Foundation for Consistency
- Repeatable setup position
- Reliable reference point
- Baseline for all variations
- Easy to reproduce

### Athletic Position
- Natural, comfortable stance
- Efficient for power generation
- Allows proper sequencing
- Promotes good balance

### Versatility
- Works with all clubs
- Adapts to various shots
- Suitable for most conditions
- No special circumstances required

### Teaching Value
- Excellent starting point for beginners
- Clear, definable position
- Easy to explain and demonstrate
- Foundation for understanding variations

## Key Reminders

1. **Shoulder-width apart** - Defining measurement
2. **Athletic and balanced** - Should feel natural
3. **Versatile application** - Default for most shots
4. **Allows full rotation** - Unrestricted hip and shoulder turn
5. **Moderate stability** - Adequate but not restrictive
6. **Standard center of gravity** - Optimal athletic height
7. **Baseline for variations** - Reference for wider or narrower

## Finding Your Normal Stance

### Visual Method
- Face a mirror
- Position feet naturally
- Check if width matches shoulders
- Adjust until comfortable

### Jump Method
- Stand with feet together
- Make a small hop
- Land naturally
- Note where feet land - this is usually close to ideal width

### Feel Method
- Set up to ball
- Try different widths
- Find most athletic feeling
- Should feel stable yet mobile

### Club-Across-Shoulders Method
- Place club across shoulders
- Hold ends with hands
- Rotate back and forth
- Width that allows full turn without restriction is good

## Adjustments from Normal

### When to Go Wider
- Driver and long clubs
- Windy conditions
- Sloped lies
- Need more stability

### When to Go Narrower
- Short irons and wedges
- Pitch shots
- Chip shots
- Smaller swing required

## Common Mistakes

### Too Wide
- Restricts hip rotation
- Creates swaying motion
- Reduces power generation
- Makes weight shift difficult

### Too Narrow
- Reduces stability
- Harder to maintain balance
- Inappropriate for full swings
- Limits power potential

### Inconsistent Width
- Changes between shots
- No reliable reference
- Harder to develop consistency
- Variables become difficult to manage
