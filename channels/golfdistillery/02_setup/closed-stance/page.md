# Closed Stance

## Definition

A closed stance occurs when the toe line crosses the target line in front of the ball, with the toe line aimed to the right of the target (for right-handed golfers).

## How to Set Up a Closed Stance

To establish a closed stance:

1. **Start with a square stance** - Begin by positioning your feet so the toe line is parallel to the target line
2. **Lift your left foot** - Raise your left foot off the ground
3. **Advance forward** - Move your left foot forward while rotating around your right foot as a pivot point
4. **Adjust right foot** - Finally, adjust your right foot slightly so it rests comfortably parallel to the left foot

The result is a stance where your body is aimed to the right of the target, while the toe line crosses the target line ahead of the ball.

## Effects on Ball Flight and Swing

### Decreased Club Loft

The immediate effect of closing your stance is that it closes the clubhead relative to the swing line, which **decreases the loft of the club**.

This results in:
- Lower ball flight than the club was designed for
- More roll upon landing
- Penetrating trajectory
- Reduced effective loft angle

### Inside-Out Swing Path

A closed stance promotes an **inside-out swing** path.

This swing path generates:
- Right-to-left sidespin on the ball
- Draw ball flight characteristics
- Potential for hook shots if excessive
- Path where club approaches from inside the target line and exits to the outside

### Clubface Relationship

Important distinction:
- The clubface remains **square to the target line** (pointing at target)
- But the clubface becomes **closed relative to the swing line**
- This relationship between face and path creates the draw spin

## Ball Flight Characteristics

With a closed stance, expect:
- **Lower trajectory**: Due to delofted clubface
- **Draw shape**: Right-to-left curve for right-handed golfers
- **Right-to-left sidespin**: Ball curves toward target or left of it
- **More roll**: Lower flight and reduced backspin create more ground roll
- **Penetrating flight**: Ball boring through the air rather than ballooning

## When to Use Closed Stance

A closed stance is appropriate for:
- **Intentional draws**: When you want to curve the ball right-to-left
- **Fighting left-to-right wind**: Draw spin helps hold ball in crosswind
- **Hook shots around obstacles**: Curving ball around trees or hazards
- **Lower ball flight**: When you need to keep ball under tree branches
- **Maximum roll**: When you want ball to release and run after landing
- **Right-to-left hole shapes**: On dogleg right holes where draw is beneficial

## Comparison to Square Stance

Unlike a square stance which:
- Maintains designed club loft
- Promotes straight ball flight
- Creates inside-square-inside path

A closed stance:
- Decreases effective loft
- Promotes draw/hook shape
- Creates inside-out path

## Comparison to Open Stance

Opposite effects from an open stance which:
- Increases club loft
- Promotes fade/slice shape
- Creates outside-in path

## Common Uses

### Course Management
- Dogleg right holes where draw helps
- Holes where right-to-left shape is advantageous
- Situations requiring lower flight

### Shot Shaping
- Deliberately curving ball right-to-left
- Working ball around obstacles
- Creating draw spin for more roll

### Wind Conditions
- Holding shots in left-to-right crosswinds
- Boring ball through headwinds with lower flight
- Penetrating trajectory in windy conditions

## Key Reminders

1. **Toe line crosses ahead of ball** - This is the defining characteristic
2. **Body aims right** - Your alignment is right of the target
3. **Clubface stays square** - Face still points at target
4. **Creates inside-out path** - Path goes from inside to outside target line
5. **Produces draws/hooks** - Right-to-left ball flight results
6. **Decreases loft** - Ball flies lower than normal
