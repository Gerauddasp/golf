# Closed Stance - Description

Stance alignment where toe line crosses target line in front of ball, with body aimed right of target for right-handed golfers.
Created by advancing left foot forward from square stance while pivoting around right foot, then adjusting right foot parallel.
Decreases club loft producing lower ball flight, while promoting inside-out swing path that generates right-to-left sidespin.
Results in draw or hook ball flight with penetrating trajectory, more roll, and curve toward or left of target.
Useful for intentional draws, fighting crosswinds, keeping ball low under obstacles, and maximizing roll on landing.
