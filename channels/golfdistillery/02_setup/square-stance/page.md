# Square Stance

## Definition

A square stance is the neutral foot positioning where both feet are arranged so that the toe line (and even better the heel line) is parallel to the target line.

## Why Use the Heel Line

The heel line is preferred over the toe line for alignment because it remains unaffected by any foot flaring. When you angle your toes outward, the toe line changes, but the heel line stays consistent as your reference.

## How to Set Up a Square Stance

To establish a square stance:

1. **Position feet parallel to target** - Both feet should be arranged so the heel line runs parallel to the target line
2. **Equal distance from target line** - Both heels should be equidistant from an imaginary line running to your target
3. **Visualize train tracks** - Think of your heel line and the target line as two parallel train tracks

The result is a neutral stance where your body alignment matches the intended target line.

## Effects on Ball Flight and Swing

### Maintains Club Loft

The immediate effect of a square stance is that it keeps the loft of the club unaltered.

This results in:
- Ball travels as the club was engineered to perform
- Standard trajectory for that club
- Design-intended launch angle
- Proper distance characteristics

### Inside-Square-Inside Swing Path

A square stance promotes an **inside-square-inside swing path**.

This swing path generates:
- Straight shot with minimal sidespin
- Club approaches from inside, squares at impact, returns inside
- Neutral ball flight
- Predictable, consistent contact
- Path that follows the natural arc of your swing

### Clubface Relationship

With a square stance:
- The clubface remains **square to the target line** (pointing at target)
- The clubface is also **square relative to the swing line**
- This alignment between face and path creates straight ball flight

## Ball Flight Characteristics

With a square stance, expect:
- **Standard trajectory**: Ball flies at the height the club was designed for
- **Straight ball flight**: Minimal curve left or right
- **Minimal sidespin**: Ball travels on a straight path toward target
- **Consistent distance**: Club performs as engineered for that loft
- **Neutral flight**: No intentional draw or fade shape

## When to Use Square Stance

A square stance is appropriate for:
- **Standard shots**: Your default setup for most situations
- **Straight targets**: When you want the ball to fly straight at the target
- **Neutral conditions**: When no special shot shape is required
- **Consistent contact**: When you want predictable, repeatable results
- **Learning fundamentals**: Building a reliable baseline swing
- **Most golf shots**: The go-to stance for general play

## Comparison to Open Stance

Unlike an open stance which:
- Increases club loft
- Promotes fade/slice shape
- Creates outside-in path

A square stance:
- Maintains designed loft
- Promotes straight flight
- Creates inside-square-inside path

## Comparison to Closed Stance

Unlike a closed stance which:
- Decreases club loft
- Promotes draw/hook shape
- Creates inside-out path

A square stance:
- Maintains designed loft
- Promotes straight flight
- Creates inside-square-inside path

## Common Uses

### Course Management
- Straight par 3s where accuracy is paramount
- Approach shots to pins in center of greens
- Driving on straight holes
- Situations where straight is best

### Shot Consistency
- Building a repeatable swing pattern
- Developing reliable ball striking
- Creating a baseline for shot shaping variations
- Establishing fundamentals

### General Play
- Default stance for most shots
- When no special shot shape is needed
- Standard setup for practice
- Foundation for all other stance variations

## Key Reminders

1. **Heel line parallel to target** - This is the defining characteristic
2. **Neutral body alignment** - Your body aims at the target
3. **Clubface square to target** - Face points at target
4. **Creates inside-square-inside path** - Natural arc of swing
5. **Produces straight ball flight** - Minimal curve
6. **Maintains designed loft** - Ball flies as club was engineered
