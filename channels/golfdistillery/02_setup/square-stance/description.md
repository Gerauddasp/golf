# Square Stance Summary

A square stance positions both feet parallel to the target line, creating neutral alignment. This setup maintains the club's designed loft and promotes an inside-square-inside swing path. The result is straight ball flight with minimal sidespin - the foundation stance for consistent golf. Use this as your default setup for standard shots and as the baseline for all stance variations.
