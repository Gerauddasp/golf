# Wide Stance

## Definition

A wide stance positions feet further apart than shoulder-width, providing enhanced stability and a lower center of gravity. This setup is particularly useful for long clubs requiring full swings and situations demanding extra balance.

## How to Set Up a Wide Stance

To establish a wide stance:

1. **Start with normal stance** - Begin with feet shoulder-width apart
2. **Widen both feet** - Move each foot outward equally
3. **Go beyond shoulders** - Feet should be noticeably wider than shoulder-width
4. **Check stability** - You should feel very planted and stable

Typical wide stance measurement:
- Feet are 2-6 inches wider than shoulders on each side
- Inside edges of feet are farther apart than shoulders
- Significantly wider base than normal

## Characteristics of Wide Stance

### Lower Center of Gravity

With wide stance:
- **Center of gravity drops** significantly
- More grounded feeling
- Enhanced stability
- Harder to be knocked off balance
- Athletic, powerful position

### Increased Stability

Wide stance provides:
- Maximum resistance to swaying
- Better balance on slopes
- Superior wind resistance
- Solid foundation for power
- Reduced lateral movement

## Effects on Swing

### Enhanced Stability Benefits

Wide stance creates:
- **Exceptional balance** - Very difficult to lose stability
- **Wind resistance** - Particularly useful on windy days
- **Slope management** - Better for sidehill lies
- **Power base** - Solid foundation for aggressive swings

### Potential Rotation Restrictions

Wide stance can cause:
- **Limited hip rotation** - Wider base restricts turn
- **Restricted shoulder turn** - May reduce coil
- **Risk of swaying** - Temptation to slide instead of rotate
- **Reduced mobility** - Less freedom of movement

### Lower Swing Arc

Wide stance affects arc:
- **Arc drops lower** - Bottom of swing is lower
- **Increased fat shot risk** - More likely to hit ground first
- **Helpful for certain shots** - Benefits bunker play
- **Club travels lower** - Path stays closer to ground longer

## Ball Flight Characteristics

With wide stance, expect:
- **Stable platform**: Very consistent contact point
- **Potential for lower arc**: If swing bottom drops
- **Power generation**: From stable base
- **Reduced mobility effects**: May affect distance if rotation limited

## When to Use Wide Stance

Wide stance is appropriate for:
- **Driver**: Long club benefits from stable base
- **Fairway woods**: Full swings with longer clubs
- **Windy conditions**: Enhanced stability fights wind
- **Sidehill lies**: Better balance on slopes
- **Greenside bunkers**: Lower arc helps contact sand first
- **Power shots**: When you need maximum stability for aggressive swing
- **Uneven lies**: Any situation requiring extra balance

## Common Clubs for Wide Stance

### Driver and Woods
- **Driver**: Standard setup uses wider stance
- **3-wood**: Full swings benefit from stability
- **5-wood**: Longer club rewards stable base
- Maximum power generation
- Full swing stability

### Long Irons and Hybrids
- **3-iron through 5-iron**: Longer clubs appreciate wider base
- **Hybrids**: Full swing shots
- Better balance for longer swings
- Stable platform for difficult clubs

### Fairway Bunkers
- When distance is needed from sand
- Lower arc can help with contact
- Stability in unstable footing

### Greenside Bunkers
- **Lower swing arc desired** - Helps club enter sand before ball
- **Stable platform in sand** - Feet planted firmly
- **Splash shot technique** - Wide stance is standard
- Essential for proper bunker play

## Benefits of Wide Stance

### Maximum Stability
- Hardest stance to lose balance from
- Best for windy days
- Superior on uneven ground
- Confidence-inspiring solidity

### Power Potential
- Solid base for aggressive swings
- Resistance to lateral movement
- Foundation for maximum clubhead speed
- Allows confident, full swing

### Specific Shot Requirements
- Standard for driver setup
- Essential for good bunker technique
- Helpful on slopes and in wind
- Necessary for certain conditions

## Drawbacks of Wide Stance

### Restricted Rotation

Wide stance can limit:
- **Hip turn** - Harder to rotate fully
- **Shoulder turn** - May reduce coil
- **Power generation** - If rotation is restricted
- **Swing length** - Difficult to complete full backswing

### Swaying Risk

With wide base:
- **Temptation to slide** - Instead of rotating
- **Lateral movement** - Rather than rotational
- **Loss of coil** - Swaying reduces power
- **Inconsistent contact** - Moving laterally affects strike

### Fat Shot Risk

Lower swing arc means:
- **More ground before ball** - Club traveling lower
- **Earlier ground contact** - Especially with short irons
- **Heavy shots** - Hitting behind ball
- **Inappropriate for delicate shots** - Too much club-ground interaction

## Comparison to Normal Stance

Unlike normal stance which:
- Moderate center of gravity
- Balanced stability and mobility
- Unrestricted rotation
- Versatile application

Wide stance:
- Lower center of gravity
- Maximum stability, potentially restricted mobility
- May limit rotation
- Specific applications

## Comparison to Narrow Stance

Opposite of narrow stance which:
- Raises center of gravity
- Reduces stability
- Facilitates rotation
- Better for shorter swings

Wide stance:
- Lowers center of gravity
- Maximizes stability
- May restrict rotation
- Better for full swings

## Comparison to Very Narrow Stance

Complete opposite of very narrow which:
- Highest center of gravity
- Minimal stability
- Maximum rotation ease
- Only for tiny swings

Wide stance:
- Low center of gravity
- Maximum stability
- May restrict rotation
- For full, powerful swings

## Key Reminders

1. **Wider than shoulders** - Defining characteristic
2. **Lowers center of gravity** - More grounded feeling
3. **Maximum stability** - Best balance among all stance widths
4. **May restrict rotation** - Watch for limited turn
5. **Risk of swaying** - Must rotate, not slide
6. **Lower swing arc** - Club travels lower to ground
7. **Standard for driver** - Most golfers use wide stance for driver
8. **Essential for bunkers** - Greenside bunker shots require this

## Setup Tips for Wide Stance

### Maintaining Rotation
- Focus on turning, not sliding
- Keep rotation feeling free
- Don't let width restrict coil
- Practice full shoulder turn despite width

### Avoiding Sway
- Feel weight shift but not slide
- Maintain spine angle
- Rotate around center
- Use core, not lateral movement

### Club Selection Consideration
- Best with longer clubs
- Potentially problematic with short irons
- Adjust width based on club
- Wider for woods, narrower for wedges

### Bunker-Specific Setup
- Wide stance is standard
- Dig feet into sand for stability
- Lower body for better control
- Open stance often combined with width

## Common Mistakes

### Too Wide
- Excessive width restricts rotation severely
- Creates more problems than benefits
- Hard to shift weight properly
- Reduces power despite stable base

### Wide for Wrong Clubs
- Using wide stance with wedges
- Inappropriate for pitch shots
- Too wide for chip shots
- Doesn't match swing size

### Swaying Instead of Rotating
- Lateral movement instead of turn
- Losing the coil
- Inconsistent contact
- Reduced power generation

### Not Adjusting for Conditions
- Using wide stance when not needed
- Failing to widen when conditions warrant
- Inconsistent width selection
- Not matching stance to situation
