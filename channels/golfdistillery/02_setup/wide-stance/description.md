# Wide Stance Summary

Wide stance positions feet significantly beyond shoulder-width, lowering the center of gravity for maximum stability. This setup is essential for drivers, bunker shots, and windy conditions. While providing exceptional balance, it can restrict hip rotation and lower the swing arc, increasing fat shot risk with short irons.
