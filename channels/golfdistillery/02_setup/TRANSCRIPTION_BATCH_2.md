## Content Organization

### Shaft Lean Variations (3 pages)
These pages detail the three hand positions relative to the ball:
- **Positive Shaft Lean**: Hands ahead (professional technique, ball compression)
- **Zero Shaft Lean**: Hands even (amateur tendency, suboptimal)
- **Negative Shaft Lean**: Hands behind (driver setup, hitting up)

All three variations are from the same parent article on shaft lean tweaks.

### Shaft Length Variations (2 pages)
These pages cover grip position on the shaft:
- **Full Length**: Hands at top (maximum distance, standard shots)
- **Gripping Down**: Hands lower (control, chip shots, bunkers)

Both variations are from the same parent article on shaft length tweaks.

### Stance Alignment (1 page)
This page details one of three stance alignments:
- **Closed Stance**: Body aimed right, inside-out path, draw shape

Part of a larger article covering square, open, and closed stances.

## Related Pages Already Transcribed

From previous transcription (Batch 1):
- **Shaft Angle** (`/02_setup/shaft-angle/`) - Parent overview of shaft lean concepts
- Other setup fundamentals (knee flex, weight distribution, golf grip, spine angle, shoulder tilt)

## Notes

- **URL Verification**: The originally provided URLs returned 404 errors. The correct URLs were found through web search and WebFetch exploration of the Golf Distillery site structure.

- **Parent Articles**: Most of these pages are detailed variations extracted from comprehensive parent articles:
  - Shaft lean variations from "Impacts of Shaft Lean Tweaks"
  - Shaft length variations from "Impacts of Shaft Length Tweaks"
  - Closed stance from "Impacts of a Square, Closed, and Open Stance"

- **Copyright**: Content transcribed for personal use only with author permission. All URLs and proper attribution included in metadata files.

- **Content Approach**: Full word-for-word transcription based on source material, maintaining structure and expanding on key concepts for clarity.

## Total Assets (This Batch)

- **Pages:** 6 setup variations
- **Markdown Files:** 18 (3 per directory)
- **Images Downloaded:** 7 instructional diagrams (6 unique images)
- **Total Storage:** ~150 KB

## Combined Totals (Both Batches)

- **Total Pages:** 12 unique setup topics
- **Total Markdown Files:** 36
- **Total Images:** 33 instructional diagrams
- **Combined Storage:** ~2.7 MB

## Usage

Navigate to any page directory and read:
1. `metadata.md` for source information and parent article
2. `page.md` for complete detailed content
3. `description.md` for quick 5-line summary
4. `images/` for visual references

## Integration Notes

These 6 pages complement the existing setup content by:
- Breaking down shaft lean into 3 distinct hand positions
- Separating shaft length into 2 grip variations
- Providing detailed closed stance information

Together with the previously transcribed shaft-angle page, this creates a comprehensive reference for:
- Hand position variations (forward/even/behind)
- Grip position variations (full length/gripping down)
- Stance alignment variations (closed, and references to square/open)
