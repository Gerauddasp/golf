## Setup

The combination of all aspects related to the way the golfer's body is positioned relative to the ball, to the club in hand, and to the target before the beginning of a swing.

## Back Tilt

The golfer's back tilts forward toward the ball, enabling shoulder rotation and arm movement while holding the club.

## Knee Flex

Knees remain flexed rather than locked to maintain an active stance during the rotating motions of hips and shoulders.

## Arms and Hands Positions

Arms hang perpendicular to the ground from the shoulders, with hands typically positioned slightly ahead of the clubhead.

## Feet Position
