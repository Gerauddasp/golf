# Shoulder Tilt (Shoulder Height Alignment)

## Shoulder Height Alignment (Sideways Tilt)

This involves side tilt of the spine, visible through shoulder alignment and the height of one shoulder relative to the other.

### Level Shoulders

Creating level shoulders requires twisting the spine. This is generally avoided except for delicate shots requiring precise control.

### Back Shoulder Too Low

If the right shoulder drops too low relative to the left:
- Makes hitting down on the ball close to impossible
- Can lead to fat shots
- Risky when this setup creeps into regular iron and wedge play
- Sometimes taught for drives (hit on upswing) but problematic otherwise

### Correct Shoulder Position

The right shoulder should naturally stand lower and closer to the ground because your right hand will be positioned lower on the grip than the left at address. This natural tilt:
- Follows proper hand positioning
- Avoids excessive spine twist
- Promotes proper swing mechanics
- Should not be exaggerated

An ideal spinal side tilt naturally follows how your hands are positioned on the club.

## Key Principle

If the right shoulder drops too low relative to the left, this makes hitting down on the ball close to impossible. This exaggerated setup is sometimes taught for hitting drives (which are hit on the upswing), but it becomes risky when this setup creeps into regular iron and wedge play where fat shots can occur.

The shoulder tilt should be a natural consequence of your hand positioning on the club rather than something exaggerated or forced.
