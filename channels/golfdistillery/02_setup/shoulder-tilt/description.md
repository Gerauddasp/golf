# Shoulder Tilt - Summary

Shoulder tilt (shoulder height alignment) involves the sideways tilt of the spine, visible through the relative height of one shoulder compared to the other.

Creating level shoulders requires twisting the spine and is generally avoided except for delicate shots, while excessively dropping the right shoulder too low makes hitting down on the ball nearly impossible and increases fat shot risk.

The correct shoulder position has the right shoulder naturally standing lower and closer to the ground because the right hand is positioned lower on the grip than the left at address.

This natural tilt follows proper hand positioning, avoids excessive spine twist, promotes proper swing mechanics, and should not be exaggerated beyond what the grip naturally creates.

Shoulder tilt should be a natural consequence of hand positioning on the club rather than something forced or exaggerated, with the ideal spinal side tilt naturally following grip placement.
