# Narrow Stance Summary

Narrow stance positions feet closer together than shoulder-width, raising the center of gravity and facilitating easier rotation. This setup excels for wedges, pitch shots, and partial swings where mobility trumps stability. The higher swing arc promotes cleaner contact on tight lies, though it's inappropriate for full swings and long clubs.
