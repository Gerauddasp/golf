# Narrow Stance

## Definition

A narrow stance brings feet closer together than shoulder-width, raising the center of gravity and reducing stability. This position is suitable for smaller clubs and abbreviated swings where mobility matters more than maximum stability.

## How to Set Up a Narrow Stance

To establish a narrow stance:

1. **Start with normal stance** - Begin with feet shoulder-width apart
2. **Narrow both feet** - Move each foot inward equally
3. **Go inside shoulders** - Feet should be noticeably narrower than shoulder-width
4. **Check mobility** - You should feel light and able to rotate easily

Typical narrow stance measurement:
- Feet are 2-4 inches narrower than shoulders on each side
- Inside edges of feet are closer together than shoulders
- Noticeably reduced base compared to normal

## Characteristics of Narrow Stance

### Raised Center of Gravity

With narrow stance:
- **Center of gravity rises** above normal
- Lighter, more mobile feeling
- Reduced stability
- Easier to lose balance
- More agile position

### Reduced Stability

Narrow stance provides:
- Less resistance to swaying
- Reduced balance on slopes
- Less wind resistance
- Less solid foundation
- Increased mobility at cost of stability

## Effects on Swing

### Enhanced Rotation Benefits

Narrow stance facilitates:
- **Easy hip rotation** - Less width to restrict turn
- **Free shoulder turn** - Natural coiling motion
- **Increased mobility** - Greater freedom of movement
- **Faster rotation** - Less stable base allows quicker turn

### Higher Swing Arc

Narrow stance affects arc:
- **Arc stays higher** - Bottom of swing is higher
- **Reduced fat shot risk** - Less likely to hit ground first
- **Better for tight lies** - Cleaner contact on firm turf
- **Club travels higher** - Path stays above ground longer

### Reduced Power Base

Narrow stance limitations:
- **Less stable foundation** - Harder to generate maximum power
- **Balance challenges** - More difficult to maintain positions
- **Wind vulnerability** - Easier to be knocked off balance
- **Not for full swings** - Better suited to partial swings

## Ball Flight Characteristics

With narrow stance, expect:
- **Cleaner contact**: Higher arc reduces ground interaction
- **Better for partial swings**: Matches reduced power needs
- **Mobility benefits**: Easier rotation can help tempo
- **Reduced stability effects**: Not ideal for aggressive swings

## When to Use Narrow Stance

Narrow stance is appropriate for:
- **Short irons**: 9-iron, pitching wedge, gap wedge
- **Pitch shots**: Three-quarter and half swings
- **Chip shots**: Small swings around the green
- **Punch shots**: Abbreviated follow-through shots
- **Tight lies**: When you need clean, crisp contact
- **Shorter swings**: Any time swing doesn't require full power
- **Rotation emphasis**: When turn matters more than stability

## Common Clubs for Narrow Stance

### Wedges
- **Pitching wedge**: Partial swings
- **Gap wedge**: Three-quarter shots
- **Sand wedge**: Pitch shots (not bunkers)
- **Lob wedge**: High, soft shots
- Better rotation for control

### Short Irons
- **9-iron**: Abbreviated swings
- **8-iron**: Three-quarter shots
- Situations requiring control over power
- Emphasis on clean contact

### Specialty Shots
- **Pitch shots**: 20-80 yards
- **Chip shots**: Around green
- **Punch shots**: Under trees
- **Knockdown shots**: Controlled trajectory

## Benefits of Narrow Stance

### Enhanced Rotation
- Easiest turn of all stance widths
- Hip rotation unrestricted
- Natural coiling motion
- Smooth, free movement

### Cleaner Contact
- Higher swing arc
- Less ground interaction
- Better for tight lies
- Crisp ball striking

### Better for Partial Swings
- Matches abbreviated motion
- Appropriate power base
- Natural for shorter shots
- Encourages proper tempo

### Improved Feel
- More sensitivity in hands
- Better distance control
- Enhanced touch
- Refined shot-making

## Drawbacks of Narrow Stance

### Reduced Stability

Narrow stance creates:
- **Balance challenges** - Easier to lose position
- **Wind vulnerability** - Less resistance to gusts
- **Slope difficulties** - Harder on uneven lies
- **Power limitations** - Not stable enough for full swings

### Inappropriate for Long Clubs

Not suitable for:
- **Driver** - Requires wider base
- **Fairway woods** - Need more stability
- **Long irons** - Full swings need solid foundation
- **Full swings** - Any aggressive, complete motion

### Limited Applications

Narrow stance is:
- **Situation-specific** - Not versatile like normal stance
- **Shot-type limited** - Only for certain scenarios
- **Conditions-dependent** - Doesn't work everywhere
- **Skill-demanding** - Requires good balance

## Comparison to Normal Stance

Unlike normal stance which:
- Moderate center of gravity
- Balanced stability and mobility
- Versatile application
- Works for most shots

Narrow stance:
- Higher center of gravity
- Reduced stability, enhanced mobility
- Specific applications
- Better for partial swings

## Comparison to Wide Stance

Opposite of wide stance which:
- Lowers center of gravity
- Maximizes stability
- May restrict rotation
- Better for full swings

Narrow stance:
- Raises center of gravity
- Minimizes stability
- Facilitates rotation
- Better for partial swings

## Comparison to Very Narrow Stance

Less extreme than very narrow which:
- Highest center of gravity
- Minimal stability
- Only for tiniest swings
- Very limited application

Narrow stance:
- Elevated but not extreme center of gravity
- Reduced but manageable stability
- For small to medium swings
- Broader application range

## Key Reminders

1. **Narrower than shoulders** - Defining characteristic
2. **Raises center of gravity** - Lighter feeling
3. **Reduces stability** - Less balance than normal or wide
4. **Facilitates rotation** - Easy hip and shoulder turn
5. **Higher swing arc** - Club stays higher off ground
6. **Better for short clubs** - Wedges and short irons
7. **Ideal for partial swings** - Three-quarter and smaller
8. **Inappropriate for driver** - Full swings need more stability

## Setup Tips for Narrow Stance

### Maintaining Balance
- Keep weight centered
- Don't narrow excessively
- Stay athletic in posture
- Focus on stability despite narrow base

### Maximizing Benefits
- Use the rotation freedom
- Enjoy the mobility
- Take advantage of cleaner contact
- Let the narrow stance enhance feel

### Club Selection Consideration
- Perfect with wedges
- Great for short irons
- Inappropriate for woods
- Match width to swing size

### Shot-Specific Setup
- Pitch shots: Narrow is ideal
- Chip shots: Narrow or very narrow
- Full swings: Use normal or wide instead
- Punch shots: Narrow works well

## Common Mistakes

### Too Narrow for Club
- Using narrow stance with driver
- Attempting full swings
- Inappropriate for long clubs
- Not matching stance to shot

### Losing Balance
- Excessive narrowing
- Windy conditions
- Slopes and uneven lies
- Trying to generate too much power

### Not Narrowing When Appropriate
- Using wide stance for wedges
- Too wide for pitch shots
- Missing opportunity for better rotation
- Not adjusting to shot requirements

### Inconsistent Width
- Changing between shots
- No reliable reference
- Random narrowing
- Not matching to situation

## Distance Control Benefits

### Enhanced Feel
Narrow stance provides:
- Better sensitivity
- Improved touch
- Refined distance control
- Greater finesse

### Natural Rhythm
Easier rotation creates:
- Smoother tempo
- Better timing
- More consistent speed
- Improved distance gaps

### Partial Swing Match
Stance width matches:
- Three-quarter swings
- Half swings
- Pitch shots
- Controlled distance shots

## When NOT to Use Narrow Stance

### Avoid Narrow Stance For:

**Long clubs:**
- Driver
- Fairway woods
- Long irons
- Any full swing

**Difficult conditions:**
- Strong winds
- Severe slopes
- Unstable footing
- When maximum stability needed

**Power shots:**
- Trying to hit it far
- Aggressive swings
- Maximum distance attempts
- When stability trumps mobility

**Lack of experience:**
- Still learning balance
- Developing fundamentals
- Building consistency
- Need more stable foundation
