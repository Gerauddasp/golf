# Very Narrow Stance

## Definition

A very narrow stance brings feet significantly closer together than shoulder-width, creating the highest center of gravity and minimal stability. This extreme positioning is reserved exclusively for delicate shots with minimal swing amplitude, particularly tight chip shots around the green.

## How to Set Up a Very Narrow Stance

To establish a very narrow stance:

1. **Start with feet together** - Begin with feet nearly touching
2. **Slight separation** - Move feet just a few inches apart
3. **Minimal width** - Feet significantly inside shoulder-width
4. **Check mobility** - You should feel extremely mobile but unstable

Typical very narrow stance measurement:
- Feet are only 4-8 inches apart total
- Dramatically narrower than shoulders
- Minimal base of support
- Almost standing with feet together

## Characteristics of Very Narrow Stance

### Highest Center of Gravity

With very narrow stance:
- **Center of gravity at maximum height** among all stance variations
- Extremely light, mobile feeling
- Minimal stability
- Very easy to lose balance
- Ultra-agile position

### Minimal Stability

Very narrow stance provides:
- Absolute minimum resistance to swaying
- Almost no balance on slopes
- No wind resistance
- Barely any foundation
- Maximum mobility, minimum stability

## Effects on Swing

### Maximum Rotation Freedom

Very narrow stance facilitates:
- **Unrestricted hip rotation** - Nothing to limit turn
- **Complete freedom of movement** - Maximum agility
- **Easiest rotation** - No width restriction at all
- **Natural body motion** - Like walking or pitching underhand

### Highest Swing Arc

Very narrow stance affects arc:
- **Arc at maximum height** - Bottom of swing very high
- **Minimal ground interaction** - Club barely touches turf
- **Perfect for tight lies** - Cleanest possible contact
- **Club travels high** - Path well above ground

### Unsuitable for Power

Very narrow stance limitations:
- **No stable foundation** - Cannot generate significant power
- **Balance nearly impossible** - For anything but tiny swings
- **Extremely limited application** - Only delicate shots
- **Not for any full swing** - Exclusively for abbreviated motions

## Ball Flight Characteristics

With very narrow stance, expect:
- **Delicate trajectory**: Soft, controlled ball flight
- **Minimal power**: Very short distances
- **Clean contact**: Highest arc prevents ground interference
- **Touch and feel**: Maximum sensitivity for finesse shots

## When to Use Very Narrow Stance

Very narrow stance is appropriate for:
- **Tight chip shots**: Minimal swing around the green

- **Good balance** - Player must have excellent stability

## Comparison to Normal Stance

Vastly different from normal stance which:
- Moderate center of gravity
- Good stability and mobility balance
- Versatile application
- Works for full swings

Very narrow stance:
- Highest center of gravity
- Minimal stability, maximum mobility
- Extremely limited application
- Only for tiniest swings

## Comparison to Wide Stance

Complete opposite of wide stance which:
- Lowest center of gravity
- Maximum stability
- Full swing power base
- Driver and long clubs

Very narrow stance:
- Highest center of gravity
- Minimal stability
- No power capability
- Only delicate chips

## Comparison to Narrow Stance

More extreme than narrow which:
- Elevated center of gravity
- Reduced stability
- Partial swings
- Short irons and wedges

Very narrow stance:
- Highest center of gravity
- Minimal stability
- Tiniest swings only
- Only chipping

## Key Reminders

1. **Feet very close together** - Only inches apart
2. **Highest center of gravity** - Maximum among all variations
3. **Minimal stability** - Nearly impossible to balance
4. **Only for chips** - Exclusively tiny swings
5. **Highest swing arc** - Club barely touches ground
6. **Maximum rotation freedom** - Zero restriction
7. **Ultimate feel** - Most sensitivity possible
8. **Unsuitable for anything else** - No full swings, no power shots
