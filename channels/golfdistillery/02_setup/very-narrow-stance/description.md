# Very Narrow Stance Summary

Very narrow stance positions feet just inches apart, creating the highest center of gravity and minimal stability. This extreme setup is reserved exclusively for delicate chip shots with tiny swing amplitude. While providing maximum feel and cleanest contact, it's completely inappropriate for any full swing or challenging conditions.
