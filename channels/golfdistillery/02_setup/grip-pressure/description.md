# Grip Pressure - Description

Metaphorical swing thought (attributed to Sam Snead) teaching soft grip pressure at address and throughout swing.
Also known as "grip the club like holding a tube of toothpaste" - just enough to hold, not squeeze.
Light grip pressure relaxes forearm/upper arm tension, promotes feel, and encourages constant grip pressure.
Gripping too firmly restricts clubhead rotation, leading to weaker shots that fade or slice.
Most useful for putting, chipping, and high-pressure situations where feel and muscle relaxation are priorities.
