# Negative Shaft Lean (Hands Behind the Ball)

## Overview

Golfers position their hands behind the level of the ball in what is known as a negative shaft lean. The shaft angle opens upward rather than toward the ground.

## Description

In negative shaft lean, the hands are positioned behind the ball at address, causing the club shaft to angle away from the target rather than toward it. This creates an upward-opening shaft angle rather than the downward-leaning angle of positive shaft lean.

## Usage & Effects

This setup position can be found on drives or on other shots that require the ball to be placed very far forward in the stance.

It promotes hitting up on the ball and a whipping motion of the wrists, at least in contrast to hitting down on the ball and compressing it.

## Key Characteristics

- **Hand Position**: Hands positioned behind the ball at address
- **Shaft Angle**: Shaft angles upward, away from target
- **Ball Contact**: Promotes hitting up on the ball
- **Wrist Action**: Encourages whipping motion of the wrists
- **Typical Uses**: Driver shots, ball far forward in stance

## When to Use

Negative shaft lean is appropriate for:
- **Driver shots**: Where you want to hit up on the ball for maximum carry
- **Ball forward in stance**: When the ball position is very far forward
- **Launch angle optimization**: When you need to maximize launch angle
- **Upward strike**: Shots requiring ascending blow at impact

## Contrast with Positive Shaft Lean

Unlike positive shaft lean which promotes:
- Hitting down on the ball
- Ball compression
- Penetrating ball flight

Negative shaft lean instead encourages:
- Hitting up on the ball
- Whipping wrist action
- Higher launch angle
- Maximum carry distance (particularly with driver)

## Important Note

The actual position of the ball matters not as a golfer can create shaft lean for balls that are back in the stance as well as forward. However, negative shaft lean is most commonly associated with forward ball positions, particularly when using a driver.
