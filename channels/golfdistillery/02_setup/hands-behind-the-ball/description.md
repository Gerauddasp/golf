# Hands Behind the Ball - Description

Negative shaft lean setup position where hands are positioned behind the ball at address, causing shaft to angle upward away from target.
This promotes hitting up on the ball with a whipping motion of the wrists rather than hitting down and compressing.
Commonly found in driver setups and shots with ball positioned very far forward in stance.
Maximizes launch angle and carry distance for tee shots by encouraging ascending blow at impact.
Contrasts with positive shaft lean's ball compression approach, instead optimizing for upward strike and height.
