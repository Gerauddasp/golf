# Open Stance Summary

An open stance positions the feet so the toe line crosses the target line behind the ball, with toes aimed left of target. This setup increases the club's effective loft and promotes an outside-in swing path. The result is higher ball flight with left-to-right fade spin - ideal for soft landings and working the ball around obstacles.
