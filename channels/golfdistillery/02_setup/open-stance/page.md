# Open Stance

## Definition

An open stance occurs when the toe line (or heel line) is not parallel to the target line but will instead cross it behind the ball. The toe line points left of the target for right-handed golfers.

## How to Set Up an Open Stance

To establish an open stance:

1. **Start with a square stance** - Begin by positioning your feet so the toe line is parallel to the target line
2. **Lift your left foot** - Raise your left foot off the ground
3. **Withdraw backward** - Move your left foot slightly backward (away from the target) while rotating around your right foot as a pivot point
4. **Adjust right foot** - Finally, adjust your right foot so it rests comfortably parallel to the left foot

The result is a stance where your body is aimed to the left of the target, while the toe line crosses the target line behind the ball.

## Effects on Ball Flight and Swing

### Increased Club Loft

The immediate effect of opening your stance is that it opens up the clubface relative to the swing line, which **increases the loft of the club**.

This results in:
- Higher ball flight than the club was designed for
- More backspin
- Steeper descent angle
- Increased effective loft angle
- Shots that fly higher and land softer

### Outside-In Swing Path

An open stance promotes an **outside-in swing path**.

This swing path generates:
- Left-to-right sidespin on the ball
- Fade ball flight characteristics
- Potential for slice shots if excessive
- Path where club approaches from outside the target line and cuts across to the inside

### Clubface Relationship

Important distinction:
- The clubface remains **square to the target line** (pointing at target)
- But the clubface becomes **open relative to the swing line**
- This relationship between face and path creates the fade spin

Although the clubface remains square to the target, it opens relative to the swing path. This alignment encourages an outside-in swing path, producing left-to-right sidespin.

## Ball Flight Characteristics

With an open stance, expect:
- **Higher trajectory**: Due to increased loft from the open clubface
- **Fade shape**: Left-to-right curve for right-handed golfers
- **Left-to-right sidespin**: Ball curves away from target or right of it
- **Softer landing**: Higher flight and increased backspin create less roll
- **Ballooning flight**: Ball climbs higher through the air
- **Reduced distance**: Higher loft typically results in shorter carry

## When to Use Open Stance

An open stance is appropriate for:
- **Intentional fades**: When you want to curve the ball left-to-right
- **Fighting right-to-left wind**: Fade spin helps hold ball in crosswind
- **Slice shots around obstacles**: Curving ball around trees or hazards
- **Higher ball flight**: When you need to clear obstacles or stop ball quickly
- **Soft landings**: When you want ball to land with minimal roll
- **Left-to-right hole shapes**: On dogleg left holes where fade is beneficial
- **Short-sided pins**: When you need extra height and stopping power

## Comparison to Square Stance

Unlike a square stance which:
- Maintains designed club loft
- Promotes straight ball flight
- Creates inside-square-inside path

An open stance:
- Increases effective loft
- Promotes fade/slice shape
- Creates outside-in path

## Comparison to Closed Stance

Opposite effects from a closed stance which:
- Decreases club loft
- Promotes draw/hook shape
- Creates inside-out path

## Common Uses

### Course Management
- Dogleg left holes where fade helps
- Holes where left-to-right shape is advantageous
- Situations requiring higher flight
- Approach shots to tucked pins

### Shot Shaping
- Deliberately curving ball left-to-right
- Working ball around obstacles
- Creating fade spin for softer landings
- Hitting high, soft shots into greens

### Wind Conditions
- Holding shots in right-to-left crosswinds
- Getting ball up quickly in calm conditions
- Creating shots that land softly despite wind

### Short Game Applications
- Greenside bunker shots requiring height
- Flop shots over hazards
- Pitch shots to tight pins
- Any shot requiring maximum loft

## Key Reminders

1. **Toe line crosses behind ball** - This is the defining characteristic
2. **Body aims left** - Your alignment is left of the target
3. **Clubface stays square** - Face still points at target
4. **Creates outside-in path** - Path goes from outside to inside target line
5. **Produces fades/slices** - Left-to-right ball flight results
6. **Increases loft** - Ball flies higher than normal
