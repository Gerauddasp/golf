## Effects & Benefits

Positive shaft lean promotes hitting down on the ball – or trapping the ball – which compresses the ball and sends it off on a pure flight path.

This approach is standard among professional golfers, with most tour players using a sizeable lean in their setup.

## Key Characteristics

- **Shaft Angle**: Reduced angle between shaft and ground (leaning toward target)
- **Ball Contact**: Promotes hitting down on the ball
- **Ball Compression**: Traps and compresses the ball for pure flight
- **Typical Users**: Professional golfers and skilled amateurs

This setup position is recommended for:

## Note

The actual position of the ball matters not as a golfer can create shaft lean for balls that are back in the stance as well as forward.
