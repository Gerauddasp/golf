# Hands Pressed Forward - Description

Positive shaft lean setup position where hands are positioned ahead of the ball at address, reducing the angle between shaft and ground.
This promotes hitting down on the ball and compressing it for optimal flight path.
Standard technique among professional golfers who use sizeable lean in their setup.
Creates ideal conditions for trapping the ball and generating pure ball-first contact.
Applicable regardless of ball position in stance (forward or back).
