Great golf posture is crucial for consistent, accurate and powerful ball striking.

You don't have to be an athlete to achieve great posture over the ball and the tips on this page will work for golfers of all shapes and sizes.

The golf swing is essentially a turning motion around a central column – that central column being your spine. The better the position and the angle of your spine at address, the better it will be throughout the swing, especially at impact.

Now, different people will have different natural postures. Your posture might not be great while you're sitting, standing or driving for example, but with a little bit of practice you can create a very efficient stance over the golf ball.

Watch the video below and review the summary beneath it for a step-by-step guide to creating great golf posture.

## Golf Posture Video Summary

Here's how to correct a poor posture position (that is either slumped or too upright):

[Step 1: Standing tall with club][images/golf-posture-drill-1.png]

- Hold the club in front of your belly button with your arms and legs straight. Stand up tall with your shoulders pulled back and stick your chest out.

[Step 2: Tilting forward from hips][images/golf-posture-drill-2.png]

- Tilt forwards making sure you tilt at the hips only. Your lower back should remain flat rather than rounded. Feel like you are pushing your behind backwards.

[Step 3: Flexing knees slightly][images/golf-posture-drill-3.png]

- As the club lowers to touch the ground behind the ball, flex your knees slightly. Avoid making the mistake of many amateur golfers by over-bending your knees.
