# Golf Posture - Description

Three-step drill for achieving perfect golf posture crucial for consistent, accurate, powerful ball striking.
Emphasizes spine as central turning column - better spine position at address means better impact.
Step 1: Stand tall with club at belly button, arms/legs straight, shoulders back, chest out.
Step 2: Tilt forward from hips only (not lower back), keeping lower back flat while pushing behind backwards.
Step 3: Flex knees slightly as club touches ground behind ball, avoiding over-bending common among amateurs.
