# Golf Grip - Summary

The grip provides the only direct proxy for hitting the ball, as the club connects to your body solely through your hands, offering multiple variations in grip type, strength, and thumb positioning.

Three main grip types exist (Overlap/Vardon, Interlocking, Baseball), with the choice being a matter of personal preference as it doesn't directly affect ball flight.

Grip strength has a direct impact on ball flight: neutral grip suits most golfers, strong grip favors draws, and weak grip favors fades, and you should rotate your hands on the grip itself rather than rotating the club after gripping.

Thumb position (long vs short) relates to whether you use an all-fingers grip or palm-and-finger grip, with each creating different feel and control characteristics.

Despite all grip variations, grip pressure should always remain soft or light, using mental images like holding a live bird or toothpaste tube gently, as soft pressure promotes feel and awareness of what the club is doing.
