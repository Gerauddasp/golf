# Interlock Grip

The way the hands connect to each other on the golf grip can vary along three main variants. The Overlap (Vardon), Interlocking and Baseball (10 Finger) grips are explained below.

## Interlock Grip

The second most widely used grip in golf is the interlocking grip. This type of grip will again see both hands connect to each other through the right hand’s little finger and the left hand’s index finger.

But in this case, those fingers will cross rather than sit one on top of the other. Indeed, as its name suggests, both hands will be held securely close to one another thanks to this locking position.

The interlock grip is famously the grip type that is used by Jack Nicklaus. And because it was utilized by his golf hero when growing up, Tiger Woods also adopted it.

While it is more true for the former than the latter, the interlock grip is quite useful for golfers with smaller than average hands and fingers.

Indeed, an overlap grip requires somewhat long fingers to allow for the pinkie to act as a solid anchor. If the pinkie is not long and strong enough the golfers risks seeing it slip out of position during the golf swing, rather than staying securely in place.
