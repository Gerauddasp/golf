## The Many Options Available

The grip provides the only direct proxy available to you for actually hitting the ball. The club connects to your body solely through your hands. Golf offers multiple grip variations: grip type, grip strength, and thumb positioning.

## Grip Types

Three main grip types exist:

### Overlap Grip (Vardon Grip)

This grip setup is suitable for most golfers. The pinkie finger overlaps the index finger of the opposite hand. This is the grip type most widely used, also known as the Vardon grip after famous golfer Harry Vardon. Junior golfers with small hands may struggle with this method.

### Interlocking Grip

This type of grip provides a very strong bond between the two hands. The right pinkie loops around the left index finger, creating a secure connection.

### Baseball Grip

Both hands press together without overlapping or interlocking, resembling a baseball bat grip. This grip type is best suited for junior golfers or those with finger or joint issues.

**Important Note:** The grip type choice doesn't directly affect ball flight and remains a matter of personal preference.

## Grip Strengths

Three grip strength variants exist:

### Neutral Grip

Thumbs rest on the grip's middle. The Vs formed by the creases between the thumb and index fingers will point towards the right side of the golfer's head. This suits most golfers without favoring specific ball flights.

### Strong Grip

Hands rotate away from the target (clockwise). This favors a draw, with the V pointing toward the golfer's right shoulder.

### Weak Grip

Hands rotate toward the target (counterclockwise). This favors a fade, with the V pointing left.

**Critical Point:** Contrary to the grip type options available which have no real impact on your golf shots, your grip strength has a direct impact on the ball flight.

### How to Correctly Adjust Your Grip Strength

You should carefully place your hands on the grip while the clubface is pointing to the right direction at address. Avoid rotating the club after gripping it; instead, rotate your hands on the grip itself, as rotating the club at address will almost surely fail to produce the desired effects.

## Long Left Thumb vs Short Left Thumb

### Long Left Thumb

The thumb extends far down the grip, easily visible with the thumb extending beyond other fingers. This leads to an all-fingers grip.

### Short Left Thumb

The thumb stays close to the hand with minimal extension. This setup creates a palm-and-finger grip.

## Palm and Finger Grip vs All Fingers Grip

### All Fingers Grip

The lower part of the grip pressed underneath the first knuckle of your fingers all the way through, from the index to the small finger.

### Palm and Finger Grip

The lower part of the grip of the club pressed underneath the second (middle) knuckle of the left index finger. The top part of the grip will be pressed against the padded portion of your palm.

## Grip Pressure

Despite multiple grip options, there is only right way in terms of grip pressure. The grip should remain on the soft or light side, regardless of other choices.

Whatever grip strength, grip type or left thumb position you use, your grip pressure should be on the soft or light side.

Common mental images include:
- Holding a live bird gently
- Gripping a toothpaste tube without squeezing

A soft grip pressure promotes feels, allowing you to better feel what your club is doing.
