# Neutral Grip - Summary

The way fingers are positioned on the actual grip of the club has an immense impact on the path the club will take around your body and ultimately the direction and flight of the golf ball. While its effects are often overlooked in favour of the swing proper, serious golfers should carefully position their hands on the grip of the club before each and every shot and treat that process as an integral part of the golf swing.

Here are several of the grip tweaks available and their corresponding effects.

A neutral grip sees both of your hands around the center of grip, not leaning towards any side but rather being located on the top of the grip.

First grip the club with your left hand making sure that when you do and when the clubface is square to the target you can see two and only two knuckles when looking down. These would be the top knuckles from your index and middle fingers.

With your left hand firmly in place, place your right hand below it and in such a way that it is opposite your left hand. Indeed, for all grip strengths, you’ll want both palms of your hands to be effectively facing each other on opposite sides of the grip.
