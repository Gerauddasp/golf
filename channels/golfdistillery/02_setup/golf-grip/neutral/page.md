# Neutral Grip

The way fingers are positioned on the actual grip of the club has an immense impact on the path the club will take around your body and ultimately the direction and flight of the golf ball. While its effects are often overlooked in favour of the swing proper, serious golfers should carefully position their hands on the grip of the club before each and every shot and treat that process as an integral part of the golf swing.

Here are several of the grip tweaks available and their corresponding effects.

## Neutral Grip

A neutral grip sees both of your hands around the center of grip, not leaning towards any side but rather being located on the top of the grip.

### How to Place your Fingers

First grip the club with your left hand making sure that when you do and when the clubface is square to the target you can see two and only two knuckles when looking down. These would be the top knuckles from your index and middle fingers.

With your left hand firmly in place, place your right hand below it and in such a way that it is opposite your left hand. Indeed, for all grip strengths, you’ll want both palms of your hands to be effectively facing each other on opposite sides of the grip.

If you’ve done it correctly, the Vs formed by your thumbs and index fingers should be pointing slightly to the right of your nose.

### What it Promotes

As its name implies, a neutral grip doesn't favour one side or the other but rather a straight ball flight.

Indeed, combined with a sound swing a neutral grip will have a natural tendency to reach back towards impact in a square position.

## Neutral Grip Effects

A neutral grip is the foundation for consistent ball striking. By positioning your hands neutrally on the grip, you create a grip that:

- Promotes a square clubface at impact
- Encourages straight ball flight
- Reduces unwanted shot dispersion
- Works harmoniously with proper swing mechanics
- Allows for natural hand rotation through impact

The neutral grip is often recommended as the starting point for golfers developing their grip technique, providing the most predictable and consistent results for most swing styles.
