# Strong Grip - Summary

The way fingers are positioned on the actual grip of the club has an immense impact on the path the club will take around your body and ultimately the direction and flight of the golf ball. While its effects are often overlooked in favour of the swing proper, serious golfers should carefully position their hands on the grip of the club before each and every shot and treat that process as an integral part of the golf swing.

Here are several of the grip tweaks available and their corresponding effects.

What would be called a strong grip will see both of your hands leaning to the right of your grip (when looking down).

This is in contrast to being more or less in the middle of the shaft.

First grip the club with your left hand making sure that when you do and when the clubface is square to the target you can see exactly three knuckles. These would be the top knuckles of your index, middle and ring fingers.
