# Baseball (10-Finger) Grip - Summary

The way the hands connect to each other on the golf grip can vary along three main variants. The Overlap (Vardon), Interlocking and Baseball (10 Finger) grips are explained below.

Finally we have what is called the baseball grip, or otherwise known as the 10 finger grip. Similarly to the sport that gave its name, this grip will see both hands pressed against each other on the grip.

However, in contrast to the other types of golf grips, no anchor will link them at all. Indeed, rather than sitting on top of other fingers or crossed with the index finger the right little finger will simply lie next to the left index finger, pressed against it.

This type of grip is usually adopted by young children as they begin swinging the club for the first times. Indeed, such a grip comes quite naturally to children – or anybody for that matter – which allow them to focus on other areas of the golf swing.

It is also used by senior golfers who have difficulties wrapping their hands around the club using any other technique, perhaps because of flexibility issues or pain in their fingers.
