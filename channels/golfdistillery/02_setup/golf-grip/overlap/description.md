# Vardon (Overlap) Grip - Summary

The way the hands connect to each other on the golf grip can vary along three main variants. The Overlap (Vardon), Interlocking and Baseball (10 Finger) grips are explained below.

First the grip that is used the most frequently by golfers around the world. Indeed, the Vardon grip – or overlap grip – is used by 90% of Tour players and an overwhelming majority of amateur golfers around the world. It is so named after the famous British golfer that was the first to promote its benefits and win major tournaments with it, Harry Vardon.

In the overlap grip, both hands are connected through the right pinky finger which will lie on top of the depression between the left hand’s index and middle fingers.

As such, the right hand will stay in close contact with the left thanks to this anchor.

The long fingers and strong hands associated with adult male golfers are most suited for this type of grip whereas children or golfers with relatively small fingers would likely benefit from different types of grips.
