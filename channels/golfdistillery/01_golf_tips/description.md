# Golf Tips Page Description

The Golf Tips page is the main instructional hub of Golf Distillery, offering step-by-step golf lessons based on proven fundamentals taught by PGA Professional Pete Styles.
The page organizes golf instruction into three primary areas: Golf Setup (alignment, stance, ball position, grip, posture), Golf Swing (takeaway through follow-through sequences), and Golf Swing Drills (practice techniques for specific swing elements).
Content is specifically structured to help beginners break down the complex golf game into core elements, with a dedicated Top 10 Golf Tips for Beginners resource.
The page serves as a navigation hub to eight major content categories including Swing Tips, Swing Errors, Shot Tips, Shot Errors, Golf Tweaks, Swing Thoughts, Golf Drills, and Golf Terms.
The instructional approach emphasizes mastering golf fundamentals progressively to help golfers play better golf consistently, leveraging golf's unique advantage of a stationary ball for careful body positioning.
