[0.16s - 5.60s]
Putting tip number 15 of 100. Get your

[3.68s - 7.76s]
eyes aligned. Let me show you what I

[5.60s - 9.76s]
mean. I got a short straight putt here.

[7.76s - 11.76s]
I'm going to line up my club head. I'm

[9.76s - 14.24s]
going to line up my body. But when I'm

[11.76s - 16.48s]
looking at the hole, I'm also getting my

[14.24s - 19.04s]
eyes lined up. So, parallel to the

[16.48s - 21.12s]
target line and looking along my target

[19.04s - 23.04s]
line. So, there's a good chance I'll

[21.12s - 25.84s]
make a good swing path and send the ball

[23.04s - 28.00s]
off on my target line. And often the

[25.84s - 30.40s]
mistake I see with people who have

[28.00s - 32.48s]
trouble with shorts is they'll get their

[30.40s - 34.16s]
club face beautifully aligned, body

[32.48s - 36.80s]
aligned, and then they'll tilt their

[34.16s - 38.96s]
head to look at the hole instead of

[36.80s - 41.60s]
turning the head. So this is the eyes

[38.96s - 44.80s]
staying online. This is the eyes going

[41.60s - 47.84s]
offline. And the danger is we stay

[44.80s - 50.00s]
offline by tilting the head and the the

[47.84s - 53.28s]
club head swings the same way as the ey

[50.00s - 55.36s]
line. So we're going to pull off to the

[53.28s - 58.40s]
left hand side. So be very careful

[55.36s - 62.00s]
aiming up that the eyes are also lined

[58.40s - 63.92s]
up. Not just club head, not just body

[62.00s - 65.92s]
eyes as well. So careful that you're

[63.92s - 67.84s]
turning your head to look at the target,

[65.92s - 70.24s]
not tilting your head to look at the

[67.84s - 74.48s]
target to send the ball off in the right

[70.24s - 79.80s]
direction. I'm Andrew Cullen and this is
