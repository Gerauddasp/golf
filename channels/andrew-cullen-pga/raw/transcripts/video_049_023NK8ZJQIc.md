| 3.52s | do with this lie? Very difficult to get |
| 5.60s | a clean contact with the putter head on |
| 7.60s | the ball when the ball's up against the |
| 9.36s | fringe. So, I've really got to hit the |
| 11.52s | ball on the equator or just above the |
| 13.84s | equator. Top it. And it's much easier to |
| 16.64s | do that not with the putter because I'm |
| 18.72s | looking at the top edge, but with a |
| 21.44s | pitching wedge or any other club, nine |
| 23.28s | iron, whatever. But the pitching wedge |
| 24.64s | is nice and short, not much longer than |
| 26.32s | the putter. So, I can see the bottom |
| 28.32s | edge. I can see where I've got to hit |
| 30.56s | the ball on the equator or just over the |
| 32.64s | equator. And then I hit it like a putt. |
| 34.64s | The classic Texas wedge. Let me show |
| 37.12s | you. Okay. So, now we just go through |
| 38.96s | normal putting procedure. So, I read it |
| 40.88s | like a putt, right to left. Here, I hold |
| 44.80s | the pitching wedge like I would hold the |
| 47.36s | putter. So, normal putting swing, but |
| 49.60s | we're trying to get no grass between the |
| 52.16s | leading edge of the club and the ball. |
| 54.24s | So again, we're just trying to hit it on |
| 55.76s | the equator or just above the equator. |
| 57.52s | Depends a little bit on the height of |
| 58.72s | the grass behind the ball. And then |
| 60.48s | we're just normal putt. Here we go. |
| 64.48s | Well, that should be good. Hit that nice |
| 66.32s | roll a little bit right to left. Not a |
| 69.20s | bad result. Almost gimme. So much easier |
| 71.68s | than trying to chip the ball or trying |
| 73.60s | to putt the ball where we get the danger |
| 75.28s | of getting too much grass between the |
| 77.20s | club face and the ball. Classic Texas |
| 80.16s | wedge. I'm Andrew Cullen and this is |
