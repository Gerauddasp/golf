[0.08s - 5.04s] Oh, tip number two, right foot flat. We

[2.48s - 8.40s] saw in that throwing motion that to be

[5.04s - 10.48s] able to move powerfully left, we need a

[8.40s - 13.12s] very stable right side. So, the right

[10.48s - 15.84s] foot's flat on the floor and pushing

[13.12s - 18.40s] towards the left side before we go into

[15.84s - 20.48s] rotation on and release. If we didn't

[18.40s - 22.80s] have stability in that right foot, we

[20.48s - 24.56s] were rolling to the outside, it would be

[22.80s - 27.68s] very difficult to move powerfully

[24.56s - 29.84s] forward. very common mistake and

[27.68s - 31.92s] something I correct almost on a daily

[29.84s - 34.08s] basis. So, we're just going to try and

[31.92s - 37.76s] keep the sole of the right foot flat on

[34.08s - 40.48s] the back swing. So, we can push early

[37.76s - 42.96s] and forwards or left really for the

[40.48s - 45.04s] right hand player as we go into strike.

[42.96s - 47.12s] Super powerful move. Why does that make

[45.04s - 49.92s] the back swing feel short? Because you

[47.12s - 53.28s] can't rotate as much. So, if the right

[49.92s - 55.12s] foot's flat on the floor, that's as far

[53.28s - 56.88s] personally as my pelvis would go.

[55.12s - 60.00s] Everybody's slightly different. If the

[56.88s - 61.76s] right foot was now to roll,

[60.00s - 64.00s] pelvis goes further, shoulders go

[61.76s - 66.48s] further, arms go further, and we tend to

[64.00s - 68.32s] lose control, and we're losing torque.

[66.48s - 70.16s] We're trying to wind the body body up

[68.32s - 72.00s] like a spring here. So, we need to keep

[70.16s - 74.08s] that right foot flat on the floor. So,

[72.00s - 77.60s] let me show you a slow-mo. First of all,

[74.08s - 80.40s] right foot stays flat, flat, flat. Now,

[77.60s - 82.72s] it's easy to push forwards and left and

[80.40s - 84.88s] get rotating nice and early and

[82.72s - 86.88s] powerfully. All right, here we go. So,

[84.88s - 89.44s] right foot flat

[86.88s - 93.56s] on the back swing for a beautiful

[89.44s - 93.92s] foundation for the down swing.

[93.92s - 98.48s] Oh, yeah. There's that baby draw again.
