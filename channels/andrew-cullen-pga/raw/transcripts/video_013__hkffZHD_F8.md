[0.08s - 4.80s] Wouldn't it be great if the ball was

[2.00s - 6.40s] just a bit bigger?

[4.80s - 10.88s] Then we would all make a much more

[6.40s - 12.72s] instinctive throwing motion. Woohoo.

[10.88s - 14.08s] Without worrying too much about whether

[12.72s - 16.56s] we're going to hit the ball or not

[14.08s - 19.12s] because the body instinctively knows how

[16.56s - 21.92s] to create speed in a projectile. Take

[19.12s - 24.48s] the javelin for example. Run up, plant

[21.92s - 26.80s] the front foot in the ground, push back,

[24.48s - 28.96s] creates rotation and breaking, and then

[26.80s - 31.68s] all the speed comes behind it with the

[28.96s - 34.64s] upper body and the arm swing. Baseball

[31.68s - 36.80s] pitcher, same thing. Big step forward,

[34.64s - 38.88s] pushing the ground for rotation and

[36.80s - 40.80s] braking, and all the momentum and the

[38.88s - 43.44s] speed comes behind them from the upper

[40.80s - 46.40s] body and arm swing. So, we need to be

[43.44s - 49.52s] throwing our projectile at the ball with

[46.40s - 51.60s] the same elements.

[49.52s - 53.84s] But because the ball's so small and

[51.60s - 56.24s] lying on the ground waiting for us, it's

[53.84s - 58.56s] way more difficult to do. So, we need to

[56.24s - 60.72s] do this from a static position, but the

[58.56s - 63.52s] elements of the down swing are the same.

[60.72s - 65.76s] We need to plant the weight on that left

[63.52s - 68.88s] side for the right hand golfer. We need

[65.76s - 71.44s] to push in the ground to create rotation

[68.88s - 74.64s] and braking. And the braking will help

[71.44s - 77.20s] the momentum of the upper body and arms

[74.64s - 80.16s] create speed on the way through. So in

[77.20s - 83.52s] this video, we are going to plant and

[80.16s - 85.52s] push to help you hit the ball way

[83.52s - 88.64s] further.

[85.52s - 91.68s] Woo! I'm Andrew Cullen. If you want to

[88.64s - 94.72s] swing better, think better, sharpen up

[91.68s - 97.44s] your short game, golf yourself to life,

[94.72s - 97.44s] and subscribe

Wouldn't it be great if the ball was just a bit bigger? Then we would all make a much more instinctive throwing motion. Woohoo. Without worrying too much about whether we're going to hit the ball or not because the body instinctively knows how to create speed in a projectile. Take the javelin for example. Run up, plant the front foot in the ground, push back, creates rotation and breaking, and then all the speed comes behind it with the upper body and the arm swing. Baseball pitcher, same thing. Big step forward, pushing the ground for rotation and braking, and all the momentum and the speed comes behind them from the upper body and arm swing. So, we need to be throwing our projectile at the ball with the same elements. But because the ball's so small and lying on the ground waiting for us, it's way more difficult to do. So, we need to do this from a static position, but the elements of the down swing are the same. We need to plant the weight on that left side for the right hand golfer.
