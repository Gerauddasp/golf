[0.32s - 5.04s] Step number three, consistent ball

[2.96s - 7.36s] position. And I'm going to recommend

[5.04s - 8.80s] that the ball position is opposite the

[7.36s - 11.20s] middle of your stance. And I'm going to

[8.80s - 13.36s] give you lots of logic for that. So,

[11.20s - 15.76s] what are we trying to do in this shot?

[13.36s - 18.88s] Basically, we want the low point of the

[15.76s - 21.44s] club head swing to come at the ball or

[18.88s - 24.00s] just after the ball. At the ball or just

[21.44s - 26.80s] after the ball, not before the ball. Why

[24.00s - 28.80s] do I want to do that? Let me explain. To

[26.80s - 32.24s] get the ball popping beautifully up in

[28.80s - 34.88s] the air on any any golf shot, we have to

[32.24s - 37.68s] get the leading edge of the club hitting

[34.88s - 39.52s] underneath the equator of the ball and

[37.68s - 41.12s] there it's going to hit the sweet spot.

[39.52s - 44.24s] Usually about the sort of third, fourth,

[41.12s - 46.88s] fifth groove on the club. So to get good

[44.24s - 49.28s] ball strike, we need to be coming here.

[46.88s - 52.40s] So we need to get the low point at the

[49.28s - 54.24s] ball or just after the ball. If we get

[52.40s - 56.32s] the ball positioned too far back in the

[54.24s - 58.32s] stance, not necessarily wrong, but we're

[56.32s - 60.80s] going to come steeper to the ball. We

[58.32s - 62.88s] got less surface area of the ball to hit

[60.80s - 65.36s] here. So, it's very difficult to come

[62.88s - 66.96s] underneath the equator. Not impossible.

[65.36s - 68.56s] Not wrong to play the ball off your

[66.96s - 70.88s] right foot, but it's quite difficult to

[68.56s - 73.04s] get a pure strike. And equally, if we

[70.88s - 74.88s] get the ball too far forward, beyond the

[73.04s - 76.56s] low point of the swing, we're either

[74.88s - 78.48s] going to chop it in the ground or we're

[76.56s - 80.64s] likely to hit the ball as the club

[78.48s - 84.72s] starts to come back up. So, we need to

[80.64s - 87.92s] get the ball at or just before the low

[84.72s - 87.92s] point of the club head swing.
