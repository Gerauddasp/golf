[0.16s - 3.44s] All right. So, just to exaggerate the

[1.92s - 6.00s] sort of arm connection, we'll stick a

[3.44s - 8.40s] head cover under both arms. I'd only do

[6.00s - 10.56s] this for really short chip shots. It's

[8.40s - 12.80s] too restrictive once we get the arms

[10.56s - 14.40s] bending and rotating. So, it works

[12.80s - 16.48s] really well for this just to get the

[14.40s - 18.72s] feeling of the one moving part. So,

[16.48s - 20.40s] you'll see just my chest turning back

[18.72s - 22.72s] and turning through. So, a great

[20.40s - 24.24s] posture, normal grip position, ball

[22.72s - 25.76s] opposite the middle of my feet. We'll

[24.24s - 28.24s] talk more about that in a minute. So I'm

[25.76s - 30.16s] just turning the chest back, turning the

[28.24s - 33.68s] chest through, collecting the ball on

[30.16s - 36.88s] the way past nearly. So we're making it

[33.68s - 39.12s] a very simple, repeatable movement.

[36.88s - 40.56s] Well, although I'm feeling one part is

[39.12s - 42.08s] moving, of course, other things are

[40.56s - 43.92s] moving. The hips are coming a little

[42.08s - 45.84s] bit, the weight starting to move further

[43.92s - 48.80s] to the left side as I swing through, but

[45.84s - 51.44s] the only conscious movement I'm making

[48.80s - 53.12s] is just the test turning. And there's a

[51.44s - 54.72s] good geometry to it. But again, in the

[53.12s - 57.36s] full swing, we want to see good

[54.72s - 59.68s] geometry, how the spec swing goes and

[57.36s - 63.04s] how the down swing goes. We're keeping

[59.68s - 66.08s] everything uh 90° to your spine

[63.04s - 68.48s] position. So, if I keep that geometry of

[66.08s - 70.48s] the swing, so sometimes the feeling sort

[68.48s - 72.48s] of left shoulder down, right shoulder

[70.48s - 74.96s] down, but we're just trying to turn the

[72.48s - 77.84s] chest, stay in posture, and then we're

[74.96s - 80.16s] getting consistency of club face, no

[77.84s - 82.64s] manipulation, of swing path, no

[80.16s - 85.60s] manipulation. And very importantly,

[82.64s - 88.08s] we're returning the same loft to the

[85.60s - 90.48s] ball as we started with. We really need

[88.08s - 92.16s] that to get consistency of trajectory.

[90.48s - 94.32s] We'll talk also more about that later.

[92.16s - 98.08s] Right. Stick my arms on. Beautiful

[94.32s - 99.68s] posture. Beautiful grip. Turn back. Turn

[98.08s - 103.40s] through. Collect the ball on the way.

[99.68s - 103.40s] Pat. This one's in.
