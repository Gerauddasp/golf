[0.08s - 4.88s] So the big problem I see is what I call

[2.48s - 7.36s] the blind spot here where lots of

[4.88s - 9.84s] players lose awareness of where the club

[7.36s - 11.92s] is in space. You'll see that from my

[9.84s - 14.56s] client swing from earlier here.

[11.92s - 16.56s] Beautiful practice swing upright to

[14.56s - 18.08s] flat. So we flatten on the down swing.

[16.56s - 19.76s] We come to what I call the beautiful

[18.08s - 21.92s] angel angle. If you haven't seen my

[19.76s - 24.00s] video on that, check this one here where

[21.92s - 26.32s] we get a great coordination between

[24.00s - 28.48s] body, hands, arms, and club. and then he

[26.32s - 31.12s] goes to the ball swing and the club's in

[28.48s - 33.60s] a completely different position in the

[31.12s - 35.68s] transition and down into the ball. So

[33.60s - 38.72s] just having awareness of where the club

[35.68s - 41.20s] is in space can help enormously with

[38.72s - 44.64s] your performance. Basically the club as

[41.20s - 47.92s] it swings back behind you, gravity wants

[44.64s - 51.12s] to do that. So we need to allow the club

[47.92s - 52.96s] to fall where it wants to fall. So if we

[51.12s - 55.44s] feel where the club is in space in the

[52.96s - 57.44s] practice swing. Yep. I feel that

[55.44s - 60.24s] transition from back swing to down

[57.44s - 62.56s] swing. And then I translate that into

[60.24s - 64.40s] the ball swing

[62.56s - 66.64s] flattening.

[64.40s - 69.12s] That's right down the stick. Then we

[66.64s - 71.60s] translate that beautiful practice swing

[69.12s - 74.72s] into your ball swing. Feel where the

[71.60s - 74.72s] club is in

So the big problem I see is what I call the blind spot here where lots of players lose awareness of where the club is in space. You'll see that from my client swing from earlier here. Beautiful practice swing upright to flat. So we flatten on the down swing. We come to what I call the beautiful angel angle. If you haven't seen my video on that, check this one here where we get a great coordination between body, hands, arms, and club. and then he goes to the ball swing and the club's in a completely different position in the transition and down into the ball.
