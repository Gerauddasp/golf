[0.24s] Putting tip number 23 of 100. My most

[3.52s] effective trigger. What's a trigger?

[5.52s] Trigger is a little prompt to start the

[7.759s] swing so you don't freeze over the golf

[9.76s] ball. So most classically Phil

[11.519s] Mickelson's was setting up to the ball,

[14.0s] giving a little forward press with the

[15.759s] hands and that was his trigger to get on

[17.84s] with the swing. Personally, I've taken

[20.56s] so much time and consideration to set

[22.72s] the club face up and set my body up. I

[24.72s] don't want to change anything from

[26.0s] there, but I don't want to freeze over

[27.84s] the ball. So my little solution to it is

[30.32s] use the eyes. So again, I'm going to

[32.559s] take time setting up. Have a beautiful

[34.64s] setup. I'm set up to get the ball

[36.399s] rolling in the right direction. So last

[39.04s] look at the hole to visualize where the

[41.04s] ball's going to fall over the edge. And

[42.48s] as soon as my eyes come back to the

[44.559s] ball, I just get on with it again. So

[47.039s] the trigger becomes your eyes. And

[50.0s] there's no delay whether it's a short

[51.76s] putt, medium putt, long putt. There's no

[54.16s] delay in coming back to the ball and

[56.719s] getting on with the swing. Classically,

[58.64s] Iron Badley did that in the highlight of

[60.64s] his career. So, look at the hole. Back

[62.8s] to the ball. That's the trigger. It's

[64.479s] almost as if the club face starts to

[67.04s] move back as soon as my eyes come back

[70.4s] to the ball. Hole. Ball. Go. There's the
