[0.16s] ball is lying on the ground. The only

[2.56s] way we're going to get this ball up in

[4.08s] the air is if the leading edge hits

[6.32s] underneath the equator of the ball here,

[9.12s] then we hit the sweet spot. We've got

[10.72s] some loft. The ball's going to fly. So,

[12.80s] the low point in the club head swing

[14.80s] needs to be at or just after the ball.

[18.24s] So, we change the task by looking at the

[21.20s] low point. We have a less stressful

[23.84s] task. We're not trying to get the ball

[25.28s] up in the air or send it straight or

[26.96s] even hit it at all. We're just trying to

[29.52s] hit the low point. So if my subconscious

[33.04s] really or my conscious is looking at the

[35.28s] top of the ball, my subconscious is

[36.96s] thinking right hit the top of the ball.

[38.96s] There's actually quite a good chance

[41.92s] full top that you are going to hit the

[43.92s] top of the ball. So this little practice

[46.08s] I give you now, what I call hitting some

[48.00s] small to get a few T's. You'll have

[50.40s] seen this on my channel many times

[52.08s] because it is the easiest way to get

[55.84s] your practice swing to your ball swing.

[58.72s] It's the most success I have with

[60.48s] customers on the golf course. So, we

[63.04s] just get a little tee. Let me just get

[64.64s] you in view here. Just get a little tea.

[66.72s] Pop it in front of the ball. And you're

[68.64s] looking at that point from start to

[71.04s] strike. And sometimes just the anxiety

[73.92s] and stress is a little bit away because

[76.00s] all we have to do is make contact with

[78.32s] the tea. We're not trying to direct the

[80.48s] ball, get the ball up in the air. I'm

[82.24s] just focusing looking at and focusing on

[84.80s] the T t

[88.40s] start to strike.
