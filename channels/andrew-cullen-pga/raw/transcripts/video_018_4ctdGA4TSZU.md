**[1.28s - 5.44s]** You know, standing the right distance

**[3.04s - 9.12s]** away from the ball can make or break the

**[5.44s - 11.28s]** success of your shot.

**[9.12s - 15.12s]** So, how do you know that you&#39;re the

**[11.28s - 16.96s]** right distance away from the ball? No.

**[15.12s - 20.32s]** No matter what club you&#39;ve got in your

**[16.96s - 22.96s]** hands. No, no, no, no, no.

**[20.32s - 29.12s]** It all comes down to two things.

**[22.96s - 31.92s]** Posture. Ah, nearly. And balance. Yes.

**[29.12s - 34.88s]** So, let&#39;s find out how you find your

**[31.92s - 37.52s]** best p posture and balance to help you

**[34.88s - 40.24s]** pure it. I&#39;m Andrew Cullen. If you want

**[37.52s - 42.72s]** to swing better, think better, sharpen

**[40.24s - 46.08s]** up your short game, and golf yourself to

**[42.72s - 50.2s]** life, subscribe here.

**[46.08s - 51.28s]** Nice one, Andy. Thanks, man.

**[51.28s - 55.36s]** So, in this video, I&#39;m going to give you

**[53.04s - 57.2s]** three steps to know that you&#39;re the

**[55.36s - 59.52s]** right distance from the ball with every

**[57.2s - 61.68s]** single club in the bag. Step one, we&#39;re

**[59.52s - 63.2s]** going to get you into your great posture

**[61.68s - 64.64s]** position. It&#39;s not the same for

**[63.2s - 67.12s]** everybody. I&#39;m going to show you how to

**[64.64s - 69.28s]** do it. Number two, I&#39;ll give you three

**[67.12s - 70.8s]** reference points so you can check

**[69.28s - 73.52s]** whether you&#39;re the right distance from

**[70.8s - 75.84s]** the ball for you. And thirdly, we&#39;ll

**[73.52s - 78.08s]** talk about the balance, which can

**[75.84s - 79.84s]** destroy a swing if it&#39;s not right at the

**[78.08s - 81.44s]** start, even if you&#39;ve got your right

**[79.84s - 84s]** distance to the ball and the posture

**[81.44s - 86.32s]** correct. All right, step number one,

**[84s - 88.48s]** finding your posture. Everybody&#39;s built

**[86.32s - 90.64s]** differently, so we need to find a way to

**[88.48s - 93.52s]** get you in your best postured position

**[90.64s - 94.88s]** to make a beautiful athletic motion.

**[93.52s - 97.12s]** Here&#39;s something taught to me by the

**[94.88s - 99.68s]** brilliant Mike Adams, biomechanist

**[97.12s - 102s]** extraordinaire. You don&#39;t have to change

**[99.68s - 104.16s]** much from your normal upright posture.

**[102s - 106.16s]** So, let me explain. If I&#39;m standing

**[104.16s - 108.8s]** straight up and down here, my head and

**[106.16s - 111.36s]** spine are more or less in a line natural

**[108.8s - 113.28s]** S form. My shoulders are wide and I have

**[111.36s - 114.64s]** a slight knee flex. I don&#39;t stand with

**[113.28s - 116.32s]** straight legs. It&#39;s not very

**[114.64s - 118.08s]** comfortable. They&#39;re slightly bent. And

**[116.32s - 121.2s]** we&#39;re trying to keep all these three

**[118.08s - 123.36s]** positions, but orientate ourselves down

**[121.2s - 125.36s]** towards the golf ball. So, the club head

**[123.36s - 127.44s]** is getting thrown down towards the golf

**[125.36s - 130.32s]** ball. So, here&#39;s the little uh test that

**[127.44s - 133.6s]** we do. Uh stand straight up, hands on

**[130.32s - 136.16s]** the thighs, and we just sit back, bend

**[133.6s - 138.48s]** from the hip joint until the hands slide

**[136.16s - 140.32s]** down on the longest finger touches the

**[138.48s - 142.8s]** top of your kneecap. You&#39;ll get a bit of

**[140.32s - 144.96s]** tension in your butt. Let the arms hang

**[142.8s - 148s]** down. Bingo. That&#39;s the right distance

**[144.96s - 149.92s]** from the ball. No matter what club I

**[148s - 151.76s]** have in my hand. So, here would be

**[149.92s - 153.84s]** pitching wedge and six irons. So

**[151.76s - 156.16s]** pitching wedge, I&#39;m definitely closer to

**[153.84s - 159.04s]** the ball, but I&#39;ve got the same posture

**[156.16s - 162.4s]** position as I would with the sixiron.

**[159.04s - 164.16s]** Okay, so pitching wedge, sixiron. And

**[162.4s - 167.52s]** equally, if I put the driver suddenly in

**[164.16s - 170.08s]** the hands. Okay, let&#39;s go. Okay,

**[167.52s - 173.36s]** standing straight up, slide down the

**[170.08s - 176.16s]** longest finger, top of the kneecap,

**[173.36s - 178.8s]** posture position, perfect, athletic, and

**[176.16s - 180.48s]** ready to rumble. All right, step number

**[178.8s - 183.2s]** two. I&#39;m going to give you three

**[180.48s - 185.2s]** reference points based on that posture

**[183.2s - 188.64s]** position I just gave you. So the first

**[185.2s - 192.16s]** reference point is again longest finger

**[188.64s - 194.48s]** touches the top of the kneecap too low

**[192.16s - 196.56s]** too upright just perfect. Let me show

**[194.48s - 199.52s]** you from the other side. So here would

**[196.56s - 201.84s]** be my position ideally top of the

**[199.52s - 203.76s]** kneecap with the longest finger. That

**[201.84s - 205.76s]** would be middle of the kneecap too low

**[203.76s - 208.96s]** difficult to make a nice turning motion

**[205.76s - 210.56s]** from there. and too high, too upright,

**[208.96s - 212.8s]** it&#39;s difficult to get the club throwing

**[210.56s - 214.48s]** down naturally to the ball by turning

**[212.8s - 216s]** your body at it. We&#39;d have to overuse

**[214.48s - 217.92s]** the hands and arms. So, that&#39;s your

**[216s - 220.88s]** reference point number one. Reference

**[217.92s - 222.8s]** point number two, you need I know we&#39;ve

**[220.88s - 224.24s]** got a worldwide audience here, but you

**[222.8s - 226.24s]** need one of these if you&#39;re in Britain.

**[224.24s - 228.72s]** That&#39;s a pound coin. We used to use an

**[226.24s - 230.88s]** old 10p. If you&#39;re in uh Switzerland,

**[228.72s - 232.96s]** use a five frank piece. Canada, you&#39;re

**[230.88s - 234.72s]** probably using a ton. Whatever. We got

**[232.96s - 238.24s]** about that thickness of coin. We&#39;re

**[234.72s - 240.24s]** going to stick that on the ground.

**[238.24s - 241.44s]** And basically with your irons, it&#39;s a

**[240.24s - 243.76s]** difficult reference point for your

**[241.44s - 246.32s]** hybrids and woods, but with your irons,

**[243.76s - 249.28s]** we want about a third of the club, the

**[246.32s - 251.36s]** toe of the club off the ground. So, we

**[249.28s - 253.92s]** should be able to slide that coin along

**[251.36s - 256.64s]** to about a third of the way uh

**[253.92s - 258.32s]** underneath your iron. And that is a good

**[256.64s - 260.56s]** reference point for your posture because

**[258.32s - 262.56s]** if that club&#39;s lying flat on the ground,

**[260.56s - 264.72s]** you&#39;ve probably gone too upright. If

**[262.56s - 267.36s]** we&#39;re able to slide that coin coin about

**[264.72s - 269.68s]** halfway uh along the club head, then

**[267.36s - 272.16s]** we&#39;re probably in too lower position.

**[269.68s - 274.16s]** So, just try and get a third of that

**[272.16s - 276s]** under the club head with your irons and

**[274.16s - 277.76s]** we should be in a good posture position.

**[276s - 280.32s]** And before it really starts pissing down

**[277.76s - 283.36s]** on me, let&#39;s do number three. We&#39;re in

**[280.32s - 285.76s]** Cornwall this week. Sunshine, showers,

**[283.36s - 288.96s]** wind, no wind. You got to take it as it

**[285.76s - 291.04s]** comes. So, reference point number three

**[288.96s - 293.28s]** is the right hand. And so again, once

**[291.04s - 295.44s]** you&#39;ve got your posture position taken,

**[293.28s - 297.36s]** I would take my right hand off the grip

**[295.44s - 300.4s]** and it should just be hanging opposite

**[297.36s - 302.88s]** the grip. Classic Butch Harmon uh uh uh

**[300.4s - 305.2s]** tip there. All right. So again, if I was

**[302.88s - 307.52s]** too far away from the ball, the right

**[305.2s - 309.12s]** hand would hang here. If I&#39;m too close

**[307.52s - 311.52s]** to the ball, the right hand&#39;s going to

**[309.12s - 313.44s]** hang here. So a good little tip just to

**[311.52s - 315.6s]** once you&#39;ve got your setup position, am

**[313.44s - 318.8s]** I at the right distance from the ball?

**[315.6s - 321.04s]** Yep. Pretty good. So, there&#39;s your three

**[318.8s - 323.52s]** reference points to know that you&#39;re the

**[321.04s - 325.68s]** right distance away from the golf ball.

**[323.52s - 327.44s]** If you&#39;re scrolling through YouTube and

**[325.68s - 329.6s]** not finding the answers to your golfing

**[327.44s - 331.76s]** questions, consider joining me at Buy Me

**[329.6s - 334s]** a Coffee. Well, I will personally answer

**[331.76s - 336.24s]** as many questions as you like in video

**[334s - 338.8s]** format. And you&#39;ll get access to a

**[336.24s - 340.8s]** growing library of the videos that I&#39;m

**[338.8s - 343.76s]** producing to answer those questions for

**[340.8s - 347.04s]** all my customers. All for the tiny price

**[343.76s - 349.12s]** of $10 a month. Now, step number three,

**[347.04s - 350.8s]** balance point or where the pressure is

**[349.12s - 353.28s]** under your feet. So, you could get the

**[350.8s - 355.44s]** first two parts really good here. Have

**[353.28s - 357.92s]** great posture, but if the weight&#39;s too

**[355.44s - 359.6s]** much into your toes, we&#39;re going to have

**[357.92s - 362.96s]** problems as soon as you start swinging

**[359.6s - 366.48s]** the club. The body never wants to fall

**[362.96s - 368.88s]** over. So, it will always react to bad

**[366.48s - 371.12s]** balance. So, if I&#39;m in a good posture

**[368.88s - 373.84s]** position, but my weight&#39;s gone into the

**[371.12s - 376.16s]** toes, then as soon as I start swinging

**[373.84s - 378.72s]** that club, then the the body&#39;s going to

**[376.16s - 380.88s]** start losing balance. So, it will react.

**[378.72s - 382.64s]** And the way it reacts if the balance is

**[380.88s - 384.8s]** too far forward in the toes or the

**[382.64s - 386.64s]** pressure is too far forward is the body

**[384.8s - 388.08s]** will stand up and now we&#39;re a different

**[386.64s - 389.28s]** distance away from the ball. So, it&#39;s

**[388.08s - 391.68s]** going to make it pretty difficult to hit

**[389.28s - 393.76s]** on the way down. Equally, if we get the

**[391.68s - 395.68s]** beautiful posture position, but we&#39;re

**[393.76s - 397.76s]** sitting back in the heels too much,

**[395.68s - 399.44s]** again, with a good start to the swing,

**[397.76s - 402.16s]** the body is going to react cuz it does

**[399.44s - 403.84s]** not want to fall over. So, it&#39;ll react

**[402.16s - 405.92s]** by moving forward. So, we&#39;re getting

**[403.84s - 408s]** closer to the ball now, and we got a bit

**[405.92s - 410.64s]** of a chance of chunking it. So, we got

**[408s - 413.44s]** to put the pressure underneath the balls

**[410.64s - 416.24s]** of your feet so that the body doesn&#39;t

**[413.44s - 418.56s]** have to react to losing balance. So once

**[416.24s - 420.56s]** we got our posture position,

**[418.56s - 423.12s]** you want to feel the pressure underneath

**[420.56s - 425.68s]** the front of your shoelaces. So as soon

**[423.12s - 428.72s]** as I start to swing, it&#39;s very easy to

**[425.68s - 431.68s]** keep my balance point. So I&#39;m not I&#39;m

**[428.72s - 434.32s]** easy to control my posture from start to

**[431.68s - 436.88s]** strike because the body is not under

**[434.32s - 438.56s]** threat of using its balance. And if you

**[436.88s - 440.4s]** like to make it even more specific, once

**[438.56s - 443.04s]** you&#39;ve got that balance, think of the

**[440.4s - 445.76s]** point behind your belt buckle, basically

**[443.04s - 448.72s]** your point of most mass or your center

**[445.76s - 452.16s]** of gravity. And the more stable we can

**[448.72s - 454.08s]** keep that point from start to strike,

**[452.16s - 456.4s]** the more chance you have of keeping your

**[454.08s - 458.72s]** distance to the ball as you&#39;re swinging.

**[456.4s - 461.92s]** I like to tell my customers, imagine a

**[458.72s - 463.44s]** glass of beautiful primitivo wine

**[461.92s - 465.84s]** sitting in the middle of your stomach

**[463.44s - 467.76s]** and try not to spill a drop as you&#39;re

**[465.84s - 470.08s]** swinging the club. So that&#39;s the last

**[467.76s - 471.92s]** one. Balance point. Make sure you got

**[470.08s - 473.76s]** your beautiful posture, weight

**[471.92s - 475.76s]** distributed underneath the balls of your

**[473.76s - 478.56s]** feet. So we&#39;re going to make it nice and

**[475.76s - 481.6s]** easy to keep your body stable as you&#39;re

**[478.56s - 483.6s]** swinging the golf club.

**[481.6s - 487.2s]** Oh yeah. So now we&#39;ve got your distance

**[483.6s - 488.8s]** to the ball, right?

**[488.8s - 493.68s]** Let&#39;s get you striking it like a

**[490.24s - 493.68s]** champion in this video.
