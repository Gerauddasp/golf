[0.72s] Putting tip number 18 of 100, thumbs

[4.40s] grip. Lots of different grips you can

[6.08s] use on the putter, but this grip taught

[7.92s] to me by the great Jeanjacle, David Lead

[10.88s] Better's mate, biomechanist

[12.80s] extraordinaire, really helps me get a

[15.44s] beautiful roll on the ball. It's almost

[17.52s] like the ball's sticking to the grass as

[19.68s] it takes off. So, what we're going to

[21.28s] try and do is just fit the joints of

[23.04s] your thumbs together into that beautiful

[25.60s] little arc there. And then we get I

[27.92s] don't even know what I do around the

[29.04s] back. I just fit the thumbs together and

[30.88s] do whatever is necessary around the back

[32.56s] and we get this beautiful left right

[35.04s] side coordination and rhythm. So, let's

[37.76s] put it into action. Little left to right

[40.48s] here slightly down a hill. Thumbs

[43.20s] together on the grip. Putt from your

[45.52s] sternum as we said in some of the other

[47.36s] tips on this channel so far. And we see

[50.72s] that beautiful roll on the ball. No

[52.48s] jumpy jumpy jumpy roll. It just sets off

[55.60s] smooth. If you're struggling with grip

[57.52s] positions, not sure what to do, try out

[59.76s] the thumbs grip. Hope that helps you.
