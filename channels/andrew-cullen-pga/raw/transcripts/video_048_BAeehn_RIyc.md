[0.8s] Putting tip number 11 of 100. Don't make

[4.319s] a practice swing. Here's a leap of

[6.4s] faith. Let me explain the concept first

[8.559s] of all and then we'll go on and roll the

[10.4s] ball into the hole. So, if I was going

[12.08s] to throw a ball at this yellow flag

[14.16s] here, I'm looking at the flag or the

[16.16s] hole and I'm just reacting to how far it

[18.56s] is away. There's no conscious

[20.72s] measurement of how far back and how far

[23.279s] through I'm swinging my arm. I'm just

[25.68s] reacting to what I see. Right? So, we

[27.84s] got one big problem in putting. We're

[29.84s] not looking at the hole. We're looking

[31.599s] at the ball. But I need that same

[34.559s] instinctive distance control

[36.96s] information. So I do my lineup, set up

[39.28s] to the ball, etc., etc., etc. So the

[41.6s] last look at the hole becomes the most

[44.16s] important for that instinctive distance

[47.36s] control. And then not to delay before

[49.76s] you hit the ball. So again, I'm just

[51.68s] reacting to how far

[55.28s] how far the hole is away from me without

[58.32s] any conscious thought of how long the

[60.32s] swing is. So let's do that again. Go

[62.079s] through the setup process. Sit up. Good.

[65.04s] Right. The last look imagining the ball

[67.68s] dropping into the hole becomes the most

[69.76s] important one. React. So again, there's

[72.159s] no measured stroke. I'm not trying to

[74.32s] swing it this far back and this far

[76.4s] through. I'm just reacting to what I

[78.72s] see. Don't make a practice swing. Trust

[81.36s] your instinct. I'm Andrew Cullen and

[84.24s] this is Golf Yourself to Life.

[88.479s] Putting tip number 12 of 100. How do I

[92.88s] practice my putting before I go out on

[94.96s] the round or playing a tournament? This

[97.759s] is all about building confidence. So, we

[100.56s] ignore all the different holes and

[102.32s] flags. If you just go miss, miss miss,

[104.96s] you're not going to go in the golf

[106.0s] course with confidence. We need

[107.28s] confidence with short putts. We need

[109.04s] confidence with long PS. You need one of

[110.72s] these. You only need a few of these. So,

[112.88s] we're just going to start with a tea in

[114.399s] the ground and we're just going to try

[116.32s] and hit the tee from very short

[118.399s] distances. So, we start just 10 or 15 cm

[121.36s] away, going progressively longer,

[125.439s] building up to about 1 meter. Obviously,

[128.0s] if you can hit the tea, yeah, definitely

[129.84s] going to hit the hole. Again, it's just

[131.44s] building your confidence that you can

[133.92s] hole out. Okay, I'm good with short

[136.16s] pads. Now I got to get the pace of the

[138.239s] greens. Again, ignore the holes. We

[141.28s] don't want to go on the golf course

[142.56s] having not hold one putt on the putting

[144.64s] green. You're just trying to get a feel

[146.48s] for the pace of the green. So, all we're

[148.959s] going to try and do is stop the ball at

[151.04s] the fringe of the green from different

[152.56s] distances. So, you're developing your

[155.12s] feel. You're finding out how fast, slow,

[158.16s] or whatever the greens are rolling. It's

[160.64s] worth doing this uphill, downhill, maybe

[163.599s] sidehill as well, just seeing how the

[165.68s] ball rolls out, but we're just trying to

[167.599s] get the ball stopping at the fringe. And

[169.599s] now I'm ready to go. I can hole out from

[172.08s] short distances. And I've got my pace

[174.319s] for the greens correct. If you haven't

[176.48s] subscribed to the channel yet, push the

[178.16s] button here. Putting tip number 13,

[181.519s] lucky for some of 100. Aim the club face

[185.28s] precisely and check it often. I've set

[187.84s] up a little station here of an alignment

[189.599s] stick and a 1 m dead straight putt. So I

[192.56s] can check if the club face is absolutely

[195.12s] 90° to my target line. And if I make a

[197.68s] very simple swing, I can set the ball

[200.159s] off in the right direction. I could also

[202.56s] make a horrible swing. As long as the

[205.12s] club face is pointing in the right

[206.64s] direction, I will still send the ball

[208.8s] off in the right direction. So, here's

[210.879s] beautifully aimed and horrible swing

[213.519s] path number one from outside to in. The

[216.56s] club face was still pointing down the

[218.799s] target line at strike, so I'm still able

[221.04s] to send the ball off in the right

[223.12s] direction. Here's horrible swing path

[226.48s] number two. I've aimed the club face

[228.48s] beautifully. I'm swinging drastically

[230.56s] from inside to out. The club face is

[233.12s] still pointing at the target line at

[235.2s] strike. So, we send the ball off in the

[237.439s] right direction. If you're not sure,

[239.36s] this is the cheap Scottish method. Stick

[242.4s] your alignment stick down. If you want

[244.72s] to splash out a few bucks, get yourself

[247.12s] a pro tutor or something similar online

[250.159s] so you know the club face is absolutely

[253.439s] 90° to your target line so we can send

[256.079s] the ball off very easily on your desired

[259.519s] target line without necessarily having a

[262.079s] beautiful stroke. Get aligned

[266.32s] spiritually and physically and good luck

[269.199s] with that putting tip.

[273.04s] Putting tip number 14 of 100. Check your

[276.639s] swing path against a flat part of the

[279.44s] edge of the green. You could use a wall

[281.44s] at home. You could use alignment sticks,

[283.44s] but you know me, cheap Scottish guy, we

[286.56s] can use something that's already

[287.919s] existing in our practice facility. So,

[290.08s] we just come to the edge of the green

[291.6s] and we check your swing path. And what

[293.52s] we're trying to see is that relative to

[295.759s] the straight line, you're swinging

[297.36s] inside, square, inside. As the club head

[302.0s] follows the turn of your upper body or

[304.56s] if the eyes follow the ball forward, we

[306.639s] get inside square down the line. Both

[310.16s] good. So, if you've been following the

[312.08s] series so far, if you make your swing

[314.56s] from the sternum, again, small movement

[317.759s] here creates big movement here. So,

[320.32s] we're not trying to rock the shoulders.

[322.32s] We're just trying to use your sternum to

[324.32s] swing it back and through. We will see

[326.88s] the club head moving on a consistent

[329.199s] path. The more moving parts you have,

[332.72s] butt moving, lower half, head moving

[335.039s] about, the more difficult it is to

[336.8s] repeat. Check the rest of this series

[339.039s] for all these tips. They're all in

[341.12s] there. So, this is just a very easy way

[343.199s] to check your swing path for

[344.96s] consistency. So, if we've got club face

[347.44s] aiming the right way, swing path

[349.44s] consistent, we're going to send the ball

[351.199s] off on your desired target line. Putting

[354.24s] tip number 15 of 100. Get your eyes

[357.6s] aligned. Let me show you what I mean. I

[359.68s] got a short straight putt here. I'm

[361.6s] going to line up my club head. I'm going

[363.52s] to line up my body. But when I'm looking

[365.6s] at the hole, I'm also getting my eyes

[368.319s] lined up so parallel to the target line

[370.96s] and looking along my target line. So

[373.36s] there's a good chance I'll make a good

[375.199s] swing path and send the ball off on my

[377.68s] target line. And often the mistake I see

[380.72s] with people who have trouble with shorts

[382.88s] is they'll get their club face

[384.72s] beautifully aligned, body aligned, and

[386.639s] then they'll tilt their head to look at

[388.96s] the hole instead of turning the head. So

[391.6s] this is the eye staying online. This is

[394.319s] the eyes going offline. And the the

[396.96s] danger is we stay offline by tilting the

[400.319s] head and the the club head swings the

[402.72s] same way as the ey line. So we're going

[404.96s] to pull putts off to the left hand side.

[407.919s] So be very careful aiming up that the

[410.4s] eyes are also lined up. Not just club

[413.84s] head, not just body eyes as well. Also

[416.8s] careful that you're turning your head to

[418.479s] look at the target, not tilting your

[420.479s] head to look at the target to send the

[422.72s] ball off in the right direction. I'm

[425.36s] Andrew Cullen and this is Golf Yourself

[428.96s] to life. Subscribe here.

[432.08s] Putting tip number 16 of 100. Keep your

[435.52s] mouth soft to get beautiful touch and

[438.24s] feel around greens. Mouth slightly open,

[441.12s] cheeks soft, tongue soft in your mouth.

[444.24s] And so with that increased feel, we're

[446.56s] able to get the pace of putts more

[448.16s] easily. So I've got a brutal left to

[450.639s] right downhiller here. I got to stop the

[453.039s] ball at the top of the slope almost

[454.479s] before it makes its own way down. So I

[456.8s] got to get beautiful touch and feel. So

[459.52s] mouth open, mouth soft. Start to strike.

[464.4s] Send the ball off on the right path. Oh,

[466.56s] that's just going to die there. Now it's

[468.479s] going to go down the hill. Move a little

[470.319s] right. Ah, just off to the right hand

[473.199s] side. Mouse soft. Stay relaxed.

[477.68s] Putting tip number 17 of 100. Putting

[481.84s] from the fringe. How do I get the pace

[484.08s] right? I'd always recommend putting from

[486.16s] the fringe rather than chipping or

[487.599s] pitching. Worst putt is always better

[490.16s] than worst chip, but getting the pace

[492.24s] right is difficult. Here is a brilliant

[494.319s] tip I learned from a Phil Mickelson

[495.919s] video some years ago where we're just

[498.0s] feeding the subconscious the information

[500.4s] it needs to get on and get the pace

[502.479s] right. So I'd go through my normal

[504.72s] routine setting up little bit of right

[507.52s] to left in this one. And now rather than

[510.4s] looking at whole ball whole ball and

[513.44s] reacting I need an extra piece of

[515.44s] information. So, we need to get the eyes

[517.839s] looking at the the edge of the green

[520.159s] where the fringe meets the green and

[522.159s] then to the hole and back to the ball.

[524.64s] Fringe hole ball go. So, we're feeding

[528.399s] the subconscious the critical piece of

[530.72s] information of how we're going to get

[533.04s] more resistance from the fringe grass

[535.2s] than when the ball's on the green. All

[536.959s] right, shut up and do it. I'll do that.

[539.12s] So, let's aim up.

[542.64s] So, we look at edge of the fringe, hole,

[545.519s] ball. Edge of the fringe, hole, ball,

[548.64s] go. We've fed the subconscious the right

[550.88s] information,

[553.279s] and we bless Phil for all the tips he's

[555.6s] given us over the years. Putting tip

[558.48s] number 18 of 100, thumbs grip. Lots of

[562.0s] different grips you can use on the

[563.279s] putter, but this grip taught to me by

[565.2s] the great Jeanjacle, David Lead Better's

[568.16s] mate, biomechanist extraordinaire,

[570.88s] really helps me get a beautiful roll on

[573.2s] the ball. It's almost like the ball's

[574.959s] sticking to the grass as it takes off.

[577.36s] So, what we're going to try and do is

[578.72s] just fit the joints of your thumbs

[580.399s] together into that beautiful little arc

[583.2s] there. And then we get I don't even know

[585.12s] what I do around the back. I just fit

[586.64s] the thumbs together and do whatever is

[588.32s] necessary around the back. And we get

[589.92s] this beautiful left right side

[592.24s] coordination and rhythm. So let's put it

[594.88s] into action. Little left to righter here

[598.0s] slightly down a hill. Thumbs together on

[600.56s] the grip from your sternum. As we said

[603.36s] in some of the other tips on this

[605.68s] channel so far and we see that beautiful

[608.24s] roll on the ball. No jumpy jumpy jumpy

[610.32s] roll. It just sets off smooth. If you're

[613.6s] struggling with grip positions, not sure

[615.279s] what to do, try out the thumbs grip.

[618.16s] Putting tip number 19 of 100, ball

[621.279s] position. I'm often asked where the ball

[623.279s] should be in relation to your feet. Got

[625.76s] nothing to do with your feet and

[627.36s] everything to do with your sternum. What

[629.279s] we want to do is hit the ball just as

[631.76s] the club heads past its low point,

[633.92s] starting to swing slightly up at the

[635.76s] ball. Low point is always opposite the

[637.76s] sternum. So, if we have the ball

[639.68s] underneath the left eye, we're going to

[641.839s] hit the ball in the right place. So, the

[643.519s] way to check it for your right-hand

[644.959s] player, stick a second ball in your left

[646.959s] pocket, sit up to your ball as normal,

[649.839s] and then grab that second ball from your

[652.16s] pocket, drop it from the left eye, and

[654.48s] if we're right over it, we'll land right

[656.48s] on top of it. So, we got the ball in a

[658.72s] position to set the ball off without any

[661.6s] back spin spin. We're not hitting down

[663.44s] on it, so it's not going to jump. It

[665.04s] should just roll from there. Okay. So,

[667.76s] that's proof of the pudding is in the

[669.279s] eating. So, let me try and get the left

[672.399s] eye over the ball. Aimed up beautifully.

[675.6s] Just got to set the thing in motion down

[677.76s] the hill here. And that works just like

[680.399s] an absolute

[683.12s] charm on most days.

[685.76s] Putting tip number 20 of 100. What do I

[689.04s] do with this lie? Very difficult to get

[691.04s] a clean contact with the putter head on

[693.12s] the ball when the ball's up against the

[694.8s] fringe. So, I've really got to hit the

[697.04s] ball on the equator or just above the

[699.279s] equator. Top it. And it's much easier to

[702.16s] do that not with the putter because I'm

[704.16s] looking at the top edge, but with a

[706.959s] pitching wedge or any other club, nine

[708.8s] iron, whatever, but the pitching wedge

[710.16s] is nice and short, not much longer than

[711.839s] the putter. So, I can see the bottom

[713.839s] edge. I can see where I've got to hit

[716.079s] the ball on the equator or just over the

[718.16s] equator. And then I hit it like a putt.

[720.16s] The classic Texas wedge. Let me show

[722.64s] you. Okay. So now we just go through

[724.48s] normal putting procedure. So I read it

[726.399s] like a putt, right to left. Here I hold

[730.32s] the pitching wedge like I would hold the

[732.8s] putter. So normal putting swing, but

[735.04s] we're trying to get no grass between the

[737.68s] leading edge of the club and the ball.

[739.839s] So again, we're just trying to hit it on

[741.279s] the equator or just above the equator.

[743.04s] Depends a little bit on the height of

[744.24s] the grass behind the ball. And then

[746.0s] we're just normal putt. Here we go.

[750.0s] Well, that should be good. Hit that.

[751.279s] Nice. Roll a little bit right to left.

[754.32s] Not a bad result. Almost gimme. So much

[756.639s] easier than trying to chip the ball or

[758.959s] trying to putt the ball where we get the

[760.56s] danger of getting too much grass between

[762.48s] the club face and the ball. Classic

[764.959s] Texas wedge. I'm Andrew Cullen and this
