[0.08s - 3.36s] So the second technical move that again

[1.68s - 6.00s] Andreas explains so well is what we call

[3.36s - 9.04s] the skater move. So if you're on ice

[6.00s - 11.52s] we're to move forwards we're pushing the

[9.04s - 13.76s] back skate in the ground to move left.

[11.52s - 16.72s] So obviously from a golf perspective if

[13.76s - 18.80s] we're pushing under the right foot to go

[16.72s - 20.96s] left the center of chest center of

[18.80s - 23.04s] pelvis is moving forward again and we're

[20.96s - 24.80s] getting the low point in the right

[23.04s - 27.04s] place. This is what you see again in

[24.80s - 29.44s] Scotty Sheffller's swing. so exaggerated

[27.04s - 32.16s] almost is he's already starting to move

[29.44s - 33.76s] left. He's moved a long way left by the

[32.16s - 35.76s] time we're coming in to strike the ball.

[33.76s - 37.12s] That's why we get some funky footwork.

[35.76s - 38.80s] There's so much pressure in the left

[37.12s - 40.40s] foot. He doesn't want to fall over. So

[38.80s - 42.64s] the left foot's going to do that to

[40.40s - 44.32s] react. And obviously so far forward that

[42.64s - 46.80s] the right foot's going to slide at the

[44.32s - 49.36s] same time. So not necessarily

[46.80s - 51.12s] recommended to do, but you get the idea

[49.36s - 52.88s] of what we're trying to do to get pure

[51.12s - 54.88s] ball strike. Okay. So let's go skater

[52.88s - 56.48s] move. Let me do it in slow-mo first. So,

[54.88s - 58.48s] we're going to go back swing. Before the

[56.48s - 60.48s] back swing's even complete, I'm starting

[58.48s - 63.12s] to push under that right foot to go

[60.48s - 65.28s] left. And then center of chest, center

[63.12s - 67.76s] of pelvis are in a very powerful

[65.28s - 70.64s] position to strike ball divot. All

[67.76s - 73.68s] right, shut up and do it. Here we go.

[70.64s - 75.12s] So, skater move early push under the

[73.68s - 78.16s] right foot before the back swing's

[75.12s - 80.72s] complete.

[78.16s - 84.24s] And again we get ball first, ground

[80.72s - 86.48s] second, deep divot underneath the left

[84.24s - 86.48s] shoulder.
