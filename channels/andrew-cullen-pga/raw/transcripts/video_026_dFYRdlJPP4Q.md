[0.08s - 4.88s] Tip number three, grip pressure. You

[2.8s - 8.32s] really need to experiment with this one

[4.88s - 11.28s] to find out how you get the best out of

[8.32s - 13.599s] leverage and rotation in the arms. What

[11.28s - 15.759s] I like to tell my customers is imagine a

[13.599s - 18.48s] scale 1 to five. One is almost as loose

[15.759s - 21.119s] as possible. The club might fly out the

[18.48s - 22.96s] hands as you strike the ball. Number

[21.119s - 25.359s] five, we're hanging on as tight as

[22.96s - 27.119s] possible. Usually not recommended, but

[25.359s - 28.64s] hell, Bryson Dashambo does that. And

[27.119s - 30.96s] he's a pretty successful golfer. So

[28.64s - 33.36s] there's no rights and wrongs again, but

[30.96s - 35.28s] mostly I see when I recommend grip

[33.36s - 37.92s] pressure number three from start to

[35.28s - 41.92s] finish, what we start to get is the

[37.92s - 43.92s] natural rotation and leverage from right

[41.92s - 45.76s] arm and left arm through strikes. So

[43.92s - 47.68s] again, the left arm returning to its

[45.76s - 49.76s] natural position, which if we've got

[47.68s - 51.6s] right at the start and right up at the

[49.76s - 53.44s] top of the swing means the club face is

[51.6s - 55.52s] going to get delivered square, which is

[53.44s - 57.84s] why you're going to hit more fairways

[55.52s - 61.039s] and greens. So grip pressure number

[57.84s - 63.28s] three would be the general solution. And

[61.039s - 66.08s] the goal is to try and keep grip

[63.28s - 68.32s] pressure number three from start

[66.08s - 69.76s] to strike. So just be aware of what the

[68.32s - 72.72s] grip pressure is at the end of the

[69.76s - 74.96s] swing. So we control grip pressure. We

[72.72s - 76.799s] control rotation of the arms. We have

[74.96s - 79.439s] better control of the club face. So let

[76.799s - 80.96s] me just show you a couple of shots here.

[79.439s - 82.56s] So I'm going to start with grip pressure

[80.96s - 85.04s] three. And we're going to keep it the

[82.56s - 87.36s] same. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three.

[85.04s - 90.08s] Three. Three. three three. So you'll see

[87.36s - 93.119s] usually a nice sequencing of the motion

[90.08s - 95.2s] when the grip pressure is not too tight

[93.119s - 98.88s] and we get a natural leverage and

[95.2s - 98.88s] rotation in the arms.

Tip number three, grip pressure. You really need to experiment with this one to find out how you get the best out of leverage and rotation in the arms. What I like to tell my customers is imagine a scale 1 to five. One is almost as loose as possible. The club might fly out the hands as you strike the ball. Number five, we're hanging on as tight as possible. Usually not recommended, but hell, Bryson Dashambo does that. And he's a pretty successful golfer. So there's no rights and wrongs again, but mostly I see when I recommend grip pressure number three from start to finish, what we start to get is the natural rotation and leverage from right arm and left arm through strikes. So again, the left arm returning to its natural position, which if we've got right at the start and right up at the top of the swing means the club face is going to get delivered square, which is why you're going to hit more fairways and greens. So grip pressure number three would be the general solution. And the goal is to try and keep grip pressure number three from start to strike. So just be aware of what the grip pressure is at the end of the swing. So we control grip pressure. We control rotation of the arms. We have better control of the club face. So let me just show you a couple of shots here. So I'm going to start with grip pressure three. And we're going to keep it the same. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. three three.
