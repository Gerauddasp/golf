[0.08s - 5.20s]
My tip number three, something I learned

[2.00s - 7.92s]
from Jeanjac Riv better's mate who

[5.20s - 10.88s]
co-wrote the A swing and it was to keep

[7.92s - 14.24s]
your lower right leg in concrete. So

[10.88s - 16.24s]
there's no movement lower right leg. The

[14.24s - 18.56s]
as you turn well with the upper body,

[16.24s - 20.64s]
the pelvis will get turned back. The

[18.56s - 22.72s]
upper thigh will definitely get pulled

[20.64s - 24.96s]
back behind you. But we need to put

[22.72s - 27.20s]
again the restrictors on. So, we've got

[24.96s - 29.60s]
flat foot and now we've got lower right

[27.20s - 32.24s]
leg and concrete. We're torquing up to

[29.60s - 34.00s]
make a very powerful movement on the

[32.24s - 36.08s]
down swing. So, you really want to sort

[34.00s - 38.24s]
of imagine that you're up to here in

[36.08s - 40.80s]
concrete on the back swing and then we

[38.24s - 42.64s]
can really power through the shot with a

[40.80s - 44.08s]
beautiful body turn on the way down. So,

[42.64s - 45.92s]
here we go. Last one. Right foot's going

[44.08s - 48.88s]
to stay stable.

[45.92s - 51.88s]
Right lower leg in concrete on the back

[48.88s - 52.88s]
swing.

[52.88s - 56.24s]
And there's the third one.
