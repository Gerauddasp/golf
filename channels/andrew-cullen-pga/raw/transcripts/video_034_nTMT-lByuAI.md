**[0:04.72]** Nice, Rory. It's what I call the angel

**[0:07.04]** angle. This beautiful relationship of

**[0:09.84]** shaft to spine angle, 90° just before

**[0:13.36]** delivery to maximize the energy through

**[0:16.24]** the body and the arms into the club

**[0:18.00]** head. It's even there with some of the

**[0:20.48]** most funky swings on the tour of all

**[0:22.32]** time.

**[0:24.00]** Nice one, Jimbo. So, I'm going to give

**[0:25.84]** you three slightly curious tips that I

**[0:28.16]** use on a daily basis with my customers

**[0:30.40]** to get you in to this beautiful angel

**[0:33.12]** angle. I'm Andrew Cullen. If you want to

**[0:35.60]** swing better, think better, score

**[0:37.92]** better, engulf yourself to life,

**[0:40.72]** subscribe here.

**[0:45.04]** So, the first exercise is what I call

**[0:46.64]** the no right hand exercise. I told you

**[0:49.52]** they were a little bit curious. So, what

**[0:51.76]** we do is take your normal setup. We open

**[0:54.16]** up the right hand and we make your full

**[0:56.40]** back swing. So, let me show you first

**[0:57.92]** and then we'll explain why we're doing

**[0:59.36]** this. So, I take my setup, open the

**[1:01.60]** right hand, make a full back swing with

**[1:03.60]** the right hand only just slightly

**[1:05.68]** pressuring against the grip all the way

**[1:07.60]** to the top. Now, the point of the

**[1:09.68]** exercise is that we start to get the

**[1:12.00]** right arm in a very good position to get

**[1:14.80]** that angel angle delivery. The right arm

**[1:17.20]** is going to bend late. The arms will

**[1:19.36]** rotate late. the elbow will point down

**[1:22.48]** and critically we get the right elbow at

**[1:25.04]** least level if not below the level of

**[1:27.44]** your left arm to deliver the club at 90°

**[1:30.64]** to the ball. So here's the exercise.

**[1:32.96]** Right hand open.

**[1:36.00]** Here's the effect. Here's the beautiful

**[1:38.48]** angle. And so when I'm coming to the

**[1:41.52]** ball now I really try and switch off the

**[1:44.32]** right hand to get that angel angle much

**[1:47.60]** more naturally.

**[1:50.80]** Woo!

**[1:52.40]** There she is.

**[1:55.04]** Angelic.

**[1:56.80]** Tip number two, we're going to call the

**[1:58.88]** radius tip. Now, you'll have seen from

**[2:01.20]** the first tip that that wasn't the

**[2:03.20]** position that Jim Fury gets in. It

**[2:05.20]** wasn't the position that Fred Couples

**[2:06.88]** gets in or John Dailyaly gets in. So,

**[2:09.92]** they are starting off most of them. So,

**[2:12.08]** Jim Furick, let's go first. Very, very

**[2:14.40]** steep. So, the right elbow flies behind

**[2:17.28]** him. But somehow he still gets into the

**[2:19.92]** magic angel angle. Fred Couples is very

**[2:22.24]** similar. He's going out out big flying

**[2:25.20]** right elbow angel angle. John Daly, not

**[2:29.52]** sure my body can do this, but I'm going

**[2:30.72]** to give it my best shot. But John Daly

**[2:33.44]** drags the club along the along the

**[2:35.12]** ground at the start. Gets the right

**[2:37.20]** elbow flying well behind him.

**[2:40.32]** Don't know how you did that all your

**[2:41.44]** life, John. And then somehow gets it

**[2:43.84]** back to the magic angel angle. So radius

**[2:46.96]** is one of the keys however you get up to

**[2:49.76]** the top of the swing to be able to get

**[2:51.76]** back into the angel angle. So the

**[2:54.32]** critical piece of the exercise is trying

**[2:56.96]** to maintain the radius between your

**[2:59.76]** hands and your chest not only up to the

**[3:02.64]** top of the swing but critically as we

**[3:05.04]** start down. As you see there all I'm

**[3:07.20]** trying to do is keep the hands away from

**[3:09.68]** me and the club is dropping down into my

**[3:12.56]** angel angle. The right elbow is folding

**[3:15.12]** naturally down underneath the left arm.

**[3:18.00]** Don't make the mistake of trying to get

**[3:19.68]** the right arm close. It's got nothing to

**[3:22.08]** do with that. It's got everything to do

**[3:24.64]** with radius where you've got the space

**[3:26.96]** to fold the right arm down. Okay. So,

**[3:29.36]** this swing all I'm going to think about

**[3:31.52]** is keeping the hands away from me in

**[3:34.96]** that transition zone.

**[3:37.04]** You won't see any dailies. You won't see

**[3:39.60]** any Furix. You'll see a pure Cullen, but

**[3:42.00]** he's keeping the radius from start to

**[3:44.32]** strike.

**[3:47.60]** Yes,

**[3:49.28]** a beautiful little baby draw. If you're

**[3:51.92]** scrolling through YouTube and getting

**[3:53.68]** more confusion than clarity, need some

**[3:55.84]** help with your own swing, or you're just

**[3:57.52]** not finding the answers to your

**[3:58.96]** questions, consider joining me at Buy Me

**[4:01.04]** a Coffee, where I'll answer your

**[4:03.04]** questions in video format personally for

**[4:05.68]** you to get you playing the best golf.

**[4:09.04]** Tip number three is what I call no

**[4:10.96]** lobsters. Did I mention curious? This

**[4:13.60]** for me is the lobster grip. These two

**[4:15.52]** fingers of the right hand. Sorry

**[4:17.28]** lefties, just think in reverse. You're

**[4:19.12]** 4% of the golfing population, but a very

**[4:21.52]** important 4%. Okay. So, here's the

**[4:23.68]** lobster fingers. So, if I'm hanging on

**[4:25.68]** for dear life with the index finger and

**[4:28.24]** the thumb of the right hand, even if I

**[4:30.40]** get beautiful takeaway, even if I get

**[4:32.72]** beautiful radius, if I'm hanging on too

**[4:35.36]** tight, I can still lose my beautiful

**[4:37.92]** angel angle and throw the club from

**[4:39.84]** outside chunks and slices and pulls and

**[4:42.80]** so on. So, we need to switch the lobster

**[4:45.68]** off. So, here's a beautiful little

**[4:47.60]** exercise that you can do without and

**[4:50.00]** with the ball. So, let me show you

**[4:51.76]** without first of all. So, normal setup.

**[4:55.76]** Take the lobster off.

**[4:58.72]** Yeah, I've lost it. No, no, no. It's

**[5:00.08]** early in the morning. Come on. Take the

**[5:01.44]** lobster off. Open those two fingers. And

**[5:03.60]** you'll see as I go through transition

**[5:05.44]** because I can't physically push the club

**[5:07.52]** that way anymore with these two fingers.

**[5:09.68]** The club will fold down into my angel

**[5:11.76]** angle. The right elbow is folding again

**[5:14.48]** to the level or underneath the left arm.

**[5:17.28]** Bingo. We're in a great position to

**[5:19.44]** delivery with a little plus point.

**[5:21.52]** You're going to get a lot more lag

**[5:23.20]** leverage on the way down. Okay. Now, you

**[5:25.92]** can do this exercise with the ball as

**[5:27.76]** well. So, normal setup.

**[5:32.80]** Take the lobster off. Beautiful. And

**[5:35.60]** then you'll see the angel angle

**[5:37.20]** appearing out of the darkness. Here we

**[5:39.76]** go.

**[5:41.76]** Oh,

**[5:43.44]** now that is shot of the day. No

**[5:45.76]** lobsters. No lobsters. No lobsters.

**[5:50.32]** Definitely no lobsters. Thanks for

**[5:52.64]** watching. If you're struggling with your
