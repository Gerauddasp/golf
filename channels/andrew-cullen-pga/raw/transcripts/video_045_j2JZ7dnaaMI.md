[0.16s] If you want to hit the ball further off

[1.92s] the tea, you need to understand the

[4.24s] difference in these two swing videos.

[6.72s] Let&#39;s see if you can spot the

[8.08s] difference.

[13.77s] [Music]

[21.06s] [Music]

[27.92s] So the two key differences were creating

[30.72s] torque on the back swing with the body

[33.28s] and creating radius in the arm and club

[36.80s] head. Both of those things giving you

[38.96s] much more club head speed and more

[41.60s] distance. So, let&#39;s examine how you

[44.24s] should turn on the back swing for a

[46.24s] powerful rotation and how we create and

[49.36s] maintain radius in the swing. I&#39;m Andrew

[52.32s] Cullen. If you want to swing better,

[54.64s] think better, feel better, and golf

[63.36s] And before you think, &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t think

[65.12s] my body&#39;s up to making such a big back

[67.04s] swing anymore.&quot; I had three 70year-old

[70.16s] clients last week. Leo, Christine, and

[72.72s] Verer, all relatively good mobility for

[75.76s] their age, who were all able to hit the

[77.92s] ball further with exactly what I&#39;m going

[80.00s] to show you right now. And stick around

[81.76s] to the end. I&#39;ll give you a little tip

[83.36s] to help you hit the ball, launch the

[85.92s] ball optimally off the tea on the golf

[88.40s] course. So, let&#39;s deal with torque

[90.40s] first. I was taught as a we latty in

[92.32s] Scotland by my old pro, turn your

[94.08s] shoulders, laddy. Turn your shoulders.

[96.32s] Well, I&#39;ve since learned that that is

[98.24s] not the most powerful or effective

[100.40s] method to create speed in the club head.

[102.56s] And I since learned from the brilliant

[104.16s] Mike Adams and Terry Rolls, a

[106.16s] biomechanists

[107.68s] extraordinaire, that we need to be

[109.84s] rotating the whole rib cage on the back

[112.56s] swing

[114.40s] rather than just turning the shoulders

[116.24s] on the back swing to create more tension

[118.88s] in the body and more radius in the arm

[121.52s] swing. So, here&#39;s the best thought for

[124.00s] trying to torque up. So, we&#39;re thinking

[126.72s] of a point in the middle of your rib

[128.48s] cage, and we&#39;re trying to stretch that

[130.96s] as far away from the ball as possible.

[134.24s] So, here&#39;s just shoulder turn. Let me

[136.72s] get my club out of the way. Shoulder

[138.56s] turn,

[140.96s] torque. So, rib cage turn. Big

[144.24s] difference in the two in the radius we

[147.52s] create and the power we&#39;re storing up in

[150.16s] the body to explode on the down swing.

[153.60s] All right, number two, radius. So, let&#39;s

[155.20s] keep this super simple. By keeping the

[157.76s] hands the same distance away from me,

[160.40s] start to strike, I maximize the radius

[164.00s] of the club head and therefore maximize

[166.08s] the speed in the club head. We&#39;re also

[168.48s] then connected between the upper arms

[170.88s] and the upper body from start to finish.

[173.28s] You might have noticed in the initial

[175.44s] videos when I just turned the shoulders

[177.52s] and got my arms swinging, we&#39;re also

[179.44s] disconnecting here. So very difficult to

[182.48s] get the torque working for you with the

[185.36s] body to the arms because the arms are

[187.12s] not connected to the body. You&#39;ll also

[189.68s] see if the arms stay wide wide, they

[192.48s] will tend to work downwards. So we don&#39;t

[194.32s] need to necessarily pull the club

[196.00s] downwards or let it fall downwards. If

[198.48s] we keep the radius, then we tend to get

[201.28s] naturally that motion and that creates a

[203.76s] lot of leverage and rotation in the

[205.52s] right arm which again is going to create

[207.76s] lots of speed. But we just have to think

[209.92s] about this distance. Hands to upper

[212.48s] body. Hands to upper body. Hands to

[215.92s] upper body to maximize the radius and

[219.20s] optimize the speed. Right. Let&#39;s put

[221.44s] these two things together. Okay. So, I&#39;m

[223.92s] going to hit two balls here. One I&#39;m

[225.36s] going to torque up. So, again, trying to

[227.04s] stretch this midpoint of my rib cage

[229.20s] away from the ball. And the second one

[231.28s] I&#39;m going to focus more on the radius of

[233.28s] the swing. You know, us men, we can only

[235.12s] think of one thing at a time. So, let&#39;s

[236.56s] deal with the first one. torque up. So,

[238.56s] I&#39;m really focusing on stretching that

[240.88s] midpoint of the rib cage away from the

[243.60s] ball in the back swing to create radius

[246.64s] and tension.

[251.28s] That&#39;s the fairway finder. That&#39;s really

[253.44s] good. And the second one, we&#39;re just

[256.40s] going to co focus on the radius. So,

[258.64s] again, I&#39;m just trying to think of

[260.40s] keeping my hands away. I&#39;m trying to

[262.08s] keep this distance between my hands and

[264.40s] the upper body same same. until the

[267.68s] ball&#39;s on its way. Okay, so here we go.

[270.08s] Thought number two, radius in the arm

[273.04s] swing.

[276.96s] Oh, better than the first one. Both

[279.04s] beautiful fairway finders. Woo. Just

[281.84s] before I get into the bonus tip, if

[283.68s] you&#39;re scrolling through YouTube and not

[285.60s] finding the answers to your golfing

[287.44s] questions, check out my Buy Me a Coffee

[289.76s] website below where I give video format

[292.96s] answers to your questions for all my

[295.20s] members. Now, little bonus tip at the

[297.44s] end here. We&#39;re just going to draw a big

[299.36s] red cross on the ball, and we&#39;re going

[301.76s] to try and hit the red cross with the

[304.24s] club head, but we&#39;re going to place the

[306.48s] cross, not absolutely square on the tea.

[308.96s] We&#39;re going to turn it towards you a

[311.28s] little bit and down a little bit. So,

[312.88s] we&#39;re encouraging an inside and upward

[316.64s] attack with the club head. All right.

[318.72s] So, here we go. Let&#39;s tee him up.

[322.80s] Orientate him round. But I&#39;ll try and

[324.40s] zoom the camera in so you can see that.

[326.08s] There he is. So now I don&#39;t have to

[329.12s] think about radius or about torque. I&#39;m

[331.52s] just looking at the red cross start to

[333.52s] finish. So here we go. Red cross, red

[336.16s] cross, red cross, red cross.

[339.84s] And it&#39;s the third fairway finder of

[341.92s] three. Many thanks for watching. If

[344.40s] you&#39;re struggling with your swing, you

[346.32s] maybe want to check out this video.
