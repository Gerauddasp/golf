[0.24s - 4.88s] Number three is what I call no lobsters.

[2.72s - 6.96s] Did I mention curious? This for me is

[4.88s - 8.96s] the lobster grip. These two fingers of

[6.96s - 10.80s] the right hand. Sorry lefties, just

[8.96s - 12.88s] think in reverse. You&#39;re 4% of the

[10.80s - 15.52s] golfing population, but a very important

[12.88s - 17.60s] 4%. Okay, so here&#39;s the lobster fingers.

[15.52s - 19.76s] So, if I&#39;m hanging on for dear life with

[17.60s - 22.00s] the index finger and the thumb of the

[19.76s - 24.08s] right hand, even if I get beautiful

[22.00s - 27.12s] takeaway, even if I get beautiful

[24.08s - 29.60s] radius, if I&#39;m hanging on too tight, I

[27.12s - 32.16s] can still lose my beautiful angel angle

[29.60s - 34.72s] and throw the club from outside chunks

[32.16s - 37.52s] and slices and pulls and so on. So, we

[34.72s - 39.12s] need to switch the lobster off. So,

[37.52s - 41.92s] here&#39;s a beautiful little exercise that

[39.12s - 43.44s] you can do without and with the ball.

[41.92s - 47.44s] So, let me show you without first of

[43.44s - 49.60s] all. So, normal setup. Take the lobster

[47.44s - 50.96s] off.

[49.60s - 52.32s] Yeah, I&#39;ve lost it. No, no, no. It&#39;s

[50.96s - 54.48s] early in the morning. Come on. Take the

[52.32s - 56.32s] lobster off. Open those two fingers. And

[54.48s - 58.40s] you&#39;ll see as I go through transition

[56.32s - 60.56s] because I can&#39;t physically push the club

[58.40s - 62.64s] that way anymore with these two fingers,

[60.56s - 65.36s] the club will fold down into my angel

[62.64s - 68.16s] angle. The right elbow is folding again

[65.36s - 70.32s] to the level or underneath the left arm.

[68.16s - 72.40s] Bingo. We&#39;re in a great position to

[70.32s - 74.08s] delivery with a little plus point.

[72.40s - 76.80s] you&#39;re going to get a lot more lag

[74.08s - 78.64s] leverage on the way down. Okay, now you

[76.80s - 83.56s] can do this exercise with the ball as

[78.64s - 83.68s] well. So, normal setup,

[83.68s - 88.08s] take the lobster off. Beautiful. And

[86.48s - 90.64s] then you&#39;ll see the angel angle

[88.08s - 92.64s] appearing out of the darkness. Here we

[90.64s - 94.40s] go.

[92.64s - 97.92s] Oh,

[94.40s - 97.92s] and that is shot of the
