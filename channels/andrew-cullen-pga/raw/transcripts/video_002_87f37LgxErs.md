[0.56s - 6.32s] If your setup position from the knees

[2.64s - 8.48s] down is a bit off, uh-oh,

[6.32s - 11.44s] then everything above the knee is

[8.48s - 14.40s] fighting to recover.

[11.44s - 16.88s] So, in this video, I'm breaking down why

[14.40s - 20.08s] your foot position and your knee

[16.88s - 22.64s] position at setup could be the secret to

[20.08s - 26.40s] hitting longer and straighter drives,

[22.64s - 29.40s] and how to find your perfect setup

[26.40s - 29.40s] position.

[30.56s - 35.20s] in minutes. I'm Andrew Cullen. If you

[33.12s - 38.64s] want to swing better, think better,

[35.20s - 42.20s] score better, and golf yourself to life,

[38.64s - 42.20s] subscribe here.

[43.52s - 48.48s] So, let's start off with some very basic

[45.52s - 51.60s] biomechanics. The why of the importance

[48.48s - 53.68s] of foot position and knee position.

[51.60s - 56.40s] Basically, with good foot position and

[53.68s - 59.36s] knee position, we are going to allow you

[56.40s - 62.40s] access to your golf swings. most

[59.36s - 65.12s] powerful movement the body rotation and

[62.40s - 67.92s] with poor foot position and poor knee

[65.12s - 70.56s] position we are going to deny you access

[67.92s - 72.72s] to that rotation. So let's start looking

[70.56s - 74.72s] at the feet and then we'll look at the

[72.72s - 76.16s] knees. So let's look at foot position

[74.72s - 78.40s] first. I'll just do some extreme

[76.16s - 81.12s] examples. So if I have both feet

[78.40s - 84.32s] pointing straight forward towards you, I

[81.12s - 87.52s] am restricting motion of the pelvis in

[84.32s - 90.64s] both directions. If I open up the right

[87.52s - 93.12s] foot, I am accessing more rotation of

[90.64s - 95.76s] the pelvis on the back swing, but I'm

[93.12s - 97.60s] denying access to more rotation on the

[95.76s - 100.16s] way through. And obviously, if I go to

[97.60s - 102.96s] the more classic Mr. Hogan setup, you'll

[100.16s - 106.24s] check his picture up on the screen here

[102.96s - 108.80s] with right foot forward, left foot open,

[106.24s - 110.96s] I'm denying access to more rotation of

[108.80s - 113.92s] the pelvis on the back swing, but I'm

[110.96s - 116.00s] accessing more rotation on the way

[113.92s - 118.24s] through. As the great Daffy Duck once

[116.00s - 121.20s] said, "The Lord giveth and the Lord

[118.24s - 123.68s] taketh away." And if we look at how the

[121.20s - 125.92s] knees affect that rotation, now if we

[123.68s - 128.16s] are too straight in the knees, again,

[125.92s - 130.56s] we're going to deny access in both

[128.16s - 132.24s] directions to the pelvis rotation.

[130.56s - 134.00s] You're probably going to get a bad back

[132.24s - 135.92s] as well, especially if you're stretching

[134.00s - 138.40s] your hamstrings. Not good for the lumbar

[135.92s - 140.32s] spine. And if we go too deep in the

[138.40s - 143.28s] knees, same thing. I'm not getting

[140.32s - 145.20s] access to rotation. And usually that's

[143.28s - 147.68s] going to create a whole lot of

[145.20s - 149.44s] compensations with arm swing and upper

[147.68s - 151.76s] body swing and standing up out of the

[149.44s - 154.48s] shot because we are not accessing the

[151.76s - 157.12s] rotation of your pelvis. So let's look

[154.48s - 160.24s] at what the right foot position and knee

[157.12s - 162.72s] position is for you because we are all

[160.24s - 164.72s] built differently. Okay. So let's find

[162.72s - 166.64s] out your perfect foot position or what

[164.72s - 168.56s] we call in the trade foot flare. I'll

[166.64s - 171.04s] show you how the brilliant Mike Adams

[168.56s - 173.44s] taught me how to find my foot flare.

[171.04s - 176.08s] Basically, take a jump forward. How you

[173.44s - 178.96s] land with your feet is pretty much how

[176.08s - 181.60s] the feet will want to be placed to get

[178.96s - 183.92s] maximum rotation of your pelvis in both

[181.60s - 185.44s] directions. I was shocked when I first

[183.92s - 187.92s] did that, as you'll see from the film

[185.44s - 190.96s] inset here, how much my right foot

[187.92s - 193.28s] turned out as I land and subsequently

[190.96s - 195.60s] find out, I got much less movement,

[193.28s - 198.48s] mobility in this right hip than I have

[195.60s - 201.12s] in the left hip. I'm working at it, but

[198.48s - 203.84s] it's still so. So my perfect foot

[201.12s - 206.48s] position as I'm setting up to the ball

[203.84s - 209.44s] is what I would call about two or three

[206.48s - 212.24s] minutes to one. So basically my left

[209.44s - 214.40s] foot is very slightly turned out. My

[212.24s - 217.04s] right foot is turned out because if I

[214.40s - 219.28s] didn't turn it out then I would be very

[217.04s - 222.32s] restricted on the back swing. So here's

[219.28s - 225.12s] my normal position. So I'm able to get

[222.32s - 227.52s] access to my hip rotation. The upper

[225.12s - 230.16s] body can turn quite freely. It pulls the

[227.52s - 232.16s] pelvis behind. My foot position helps

[230.16s - 235.28s] that the pelvis can get turned behind

[232.16s - 238.00s] and I'm able to rotate and stay stable

[235.28s - 240.08s] to the ball position. If I didn't turn

[238.00s - 242.80s] that out, if I had the right foot

[240.08s - 244.64s] pointing forward for me, if you're very

[242.80s - 247.04s] mobile, it could be the right position

[244.64s - 249.68s] for you, but it would restrict my right

[247.04s - 251.84s] hip. I can't go any further than that.

[249.68s - 254.16s] So, if I want to get access to more

[251.84s - 256.64s] swing, I'm going to have to stand out of

[254.16s - 259.36s] the shot because the pelvis is not going

[256.64s - 262.00s] to rotate or swing the arms further and

[259.36s - 264.64s] probably lose arm control. Both things

[262.00s - 266.56s] not very helpful

[264.64s - 268.64s] both for your golf swing and for your

[266.56s - 271.68s] back. So, we want to find that natural

[268.64s - 274.48s] position. Now, obviously, if I goes too

[271.68s - 276.96s] far with the right side, again, I'm

[274.48s - 278.88s] denying myself access on the way

[276.96s - 280.56s] through. Even though the right foot is

[278.88s - 283.28s] obviously going to come off the ground

[280.56s - 285.68s] as I go through, I'm still restricting

[283.28s - 288.40s] that first phase of the down swing. So,

[285.68s - 290.08s] we never want to go too extreme here.

[288.40s - 292.80s] Usually, by the measurements, we don't

[290.08s - 294.96s] want to go much outside about 15° from

[292.80s - 297.44s] straight forward. We're just trying to

[294.96s - 299.68s] get some little bit access to that side.

[297.44s - 302.24s] So, my recommendation for your foot

[299.68s - 304.40s] flare would be if you're struggling with

[302.24s - 307.76s] stability and rotation on the back

[304.40s - 309.68s] swing, you're probably like me going to

[307.76s - 311.68s] have to have that right foot slightly

[309.68s - 314.56s] turned out. But that's going to give you

[311.68s - 315.68s] much more rotation, much more radius in

[314.56s - 317.60s] the swing. That's where we're going to

[315.68s - 320.32s] get some speed from, as well as having

[317.60s - 322.72s] the space to swing the club more from

[320.32s - 325.44s] inside on the way down. If again, if I

[322.72s - 327.36s] deny myself that access, right foot

[325.44s - 329.36s] pointing forward,

[327.36s - 331.92s] difficult to stay stable, difficult to

[329.36s - 334.08s] rotate, and there's virtually no chance

[331.92s - 337.60s] of getting the club from inside. Now,

[334.08s - 340.56s] Mr. Hogan was advocate of right foot

[337.60s - 343.12s] forward and left foot out if you have no

[340.56s - 345.52s] mobility problem or stability problem on

[343.12s - 347.44s] the back swing. Absolutely. This can be

[345.52s - 350.16s] a big source of power. It's what Mr.

[347.44s - 352.40s] Woods just did quite famously in his

[350.16s - 354.72s] career when he was set up for a big one.

[352.40s - 356.40s] He would just turn the left foot out out

[354.72s - 359.92s] slightly. But as you remember from my

[356.40s - 362.56s] Daffy Duck uh phrase, basically we are

[359.92s - 365.60s] we are giving access on this side, but

[362.56s - 368.72s] we are taking away access on this side.

[365.60s - 370.96s] So my recommendation, do your jump. Find

[368.72s - 373.68s] where the feet want to naturally sit.

[370.96s - 376.48s] That should give you your most access in

[373.68s - 379.92s] both directions to your most powerful

[376.48s - 382.56s] move, body rotation. In this video, I've

[379.92s - 385.76s] been trying out Fitville Golf Shoes, a

[382.56s - 387.68s] company dedicated to human foot health.

[385.76s - 390.08s] If you have particularly wide feet, or

[387.68s - 392.72s] if you have foot concerns, playing 18

[390.08s - 395.76s] holes, wearing these shoes could be a

[392.72s - 398.24s] gamecher. Fitville shoes have a comfort

[395.76s - 400.64s] fit, wide toe box, arch support and

[398.24s - 403.12s] stability, exceptional grip, and

[400.64s - 406.80s] waterresistant uppers, making your

[403.12s - 408.56s] 18hole walk a pleasure, not a pain. I

[406.80s - 410.08s] can genuinely recommend the comfort of

[408.56s - 412.56s] these shoes. I took them straight out

[410.08s - 414.72s] the box, played 18 holes. It was a joy

[412.56s - 416.96s] to walk in. What they may lack a little

[414.72s - 418.96s] bit in fashion, they more than make up

[416.96s - 421.36s] for in function. Check out the

[418.96s - 423.68s] description in the description box below

[421.36s - 426.40s] for the golf shoes, you will also get a

[423.68s - 428.56s] 28% discount if you use the code down

[426.40s - 430.88s] there. So, let's move up from the feet

[428.56s - 433.84s] to the knees. much less complex than the

[430.88s - 436.32s] foot position is, but just as if not

[433.84s - 439.04s] more important than your foot position.

[436.32s - 441.52s] So, let's talk about how much flex is

[439.04s - 443.92s] the right flex for you. When you're

[441.52s - 445.92s] standing straight up and down, the knees

[443.92s - 448.32s] will be in a slightly flexed position.

[445.92s - 450.48s] It's not comfortable to stand with your

[448.32s - 452.48s] legs absolutely locked out. So, there is

[450.48s - 454.00s] already a little flex there before

[452.48s - 456.00s] you're addressing the ball. And all we

[454.00s - 457.76s] need to do to address the ball is just

[456.00s - 460.16s] bend from your hip joint, making sure

[457.76s - 462.96s] the weight stays under your shoelaces.

[460.16s - 465.52s] So, I'm not changing the relationship of

[462.96s - 467.84s] my lower leg to the ground. It's staying

[465.52s - 470.64s] more or less 90° to the ground. So, I

[467.84s - 472.88s] have a little knee flex in my normal

[470.64s - 475.76s] standing straight position. And I just

[472.88s - 478.00s] keep that same knee flex as I'm bending

[475.76s - 481.36s] forward to address the ball. That would

[478.00s - 483.84s] be a natural position. Now if you find

[481.36s - 486.72s] from there as I do as well you have

[483.84s - 489.04s] short hamstrings or tight hamstrings

[486.72s - 491.28s] that might be a little bit uncomfortable

[489.04s - 493.68s] position and when the hamstrings are

[491.28s - 495.52s] tight it's not good news for your lumbar

[493.68s - 497.20s] spine. It'll need to try and rotate more

[495.52s - 499.36s] and the lumbar spine does not want to

[497.20s - 502.32s] rotate much without getting sore. All

[499.36s - 504.00s] right. So with me again my personal

[502.32s - 506.88s] position would be from this standing

[504.00s - 509.60s] straight position I would bend back and

[506.88s - 512.16s] to take the strain off my hamstrings the

[509.60s - 514.80s] knees do have to go a little bit but not

[512.16s - 517.84s] so much that I'm going to deny access to

[514.80s - 520.24s] the rotation of my pelvis if I go too

[517.84s - 522.40s] much in the knees and this is the most

[520.24s - 523.84s] common problem I would say with people

[522.40s - 526.72s] setting up to the ball and not being

[523.84s - 529.68s] able to rotate properly is going too far

[526.72s - 531.68s] forward with the knees over the toes

[529.68s - 533.84s] From there, again, something's got to

[531.68s - 535.84s] happen to access that rotation because

[533.84s - 538.56s] here I'm blocked. So, we're either going

[535.84s - 540.32s] to stand out of it to get that rotation

[538.56s - 542.48s] or we're going to overcompensate with

[540.32s - 544.24s] arm swing or we're going to get your

[542.48s - 547.36s] problems with your back again as you try

[544.24s - 550.24s] to over rotate from here with the pelvis

[547.36s - 552.88s] not coming with you. So, too much knee

[550.24s - 555.52s] flex is more the danger here than too

[552.88s - 558.72s] little knee flex. Again, I would go with

[555.52s - 560.00s] standing straight, hips back. That

[558.72s - 561.76s] should be your natural. If that's

[560.00s - 563.60s] comfortable, go with it. If it's a

[561.76s - 565.36s] little too tight on your hamstrings, a

[563.60s - 567.60s] little more flex. But I would try and

[565.36s - 570.96s] keep your knee flexed to a minimum so we

[567.60s - 573.84s] get full access to your rotation.

[570.96s - 576.88s] So, if we get your foot position perfect

[573.84s - 580.16s] for you and we get your knee position

[576.88s - 583.12s] perfect for you,

[580.16s - 585.68s] accessing beautiful rotation,

[583.12s - 588.00s] nothing it today on both sides, but

[585.68s - 591.44s] you're still missing fairways, then you

[588.00s - 591.44s] need to check this video out here.
