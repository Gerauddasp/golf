[0.48s] Putting tip number 19 of 100, ball

[3.6s] position. I&#39;m often asked where the ball

[5.68s] should be in relation to your feet. Got

[8.08s] nothing to do with your feet and

[9.76s] everything to do with your sternum. What

[11.679s] we want to do is hit the ball just as

[14.16s] the club heads past its low point,

[16.32s] starting to swing slightly up at the

[18.08s] ball. Low point is always opposite the

[20.16s] sternum. So, if we have the ball

[22s] underneath the left eye, we&#39;re going to

[24.16s] hit the ball in the right place. So, the

[25.92s] way to check it for your right-hand

[27.279s] player, stick a second ball in your left

[29.279s] pocket, sit up to your ball as normal,

[32.239s] and then grab that second ball from your

[34.559s] pocket, drop it from the left eye, and

[36.88s] if we&#39;re right over it, we&#39;ll land right

[38.8s] on top of it. So, we got the ball in a

[41.12s] position to set the ball off without any

[44s] back spin spin. We&#39;re not hitting down

[45.76s] on it, so it&#39;s not going to jump. It

[47.44s] should just roll from there. Okay. So,

[50.16s] that&#39;s proof of the pudding is in the

[51.68s] eating. So, let me try and get the left

[54.719s] eye over the ball. Aimed up beautifully.

[58s] Just got to set the thing in motion down

[60.16s] the hill here. And that works just like

[62.8s] an absolute

[65.439s] charm on most days. Thanks for watching.
