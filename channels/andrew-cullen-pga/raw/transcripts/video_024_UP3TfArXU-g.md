[0.16s - 5.52s] Step number two, one moving part. The

[3.84s - 7.76s] only thing I want to feel that I'm

[5.52s - 9.84s] moving here is my chest. I'm just going

[7.76s - 12.08s] to turn the rib cage and turn the rib

[9.84s - 15.04s] cage. So, a very short shot, very short

[12.08s - 16.56s] turn, longer shot, longer turn. That was

[15.04s - 18.56s] one of the reasons why I want to get you

[16.56s - 20.72s] in really good posture, same as the full

[18.56s - 23.20s] swing, so that when we just use the turn

[20.72s - 25.60s] of the body, we're actually sending the

[23.20s - 28.80s] club down towards the ball. What I often

[25.60s - 31.44s] see with really bad chipping is really

[28.80s - 33.92s] bad posture. Very upright, shoulders

[31.44s - 35.36s] round, head down, the swing goes into

[33.92s - 38.96s] the hands and arms, what I'll call the

[35.36s - 40.80s] windscreen wipers shot where the arms

[38.96s - 42.40s] are kind of doing their thing and you'll

[40.80s - 44.48s] get the odd good shot, but it's very

[42.40s - 47.04s] difficult to repeat. This again is all

[44.48s - 49.04s] about repetition of movement and

[47.04s - 51.36s] repetition of how the ball is going to

[49.04s - 53.36s] react from the club face. So, we're just

[51.36s - 55.92s] doing one moving part. The chest is

[53.36s - 58.16s] turning back and turning through. I feel

[55.92s - 59.60s] as if my arms are stuck onto my sides.

[58.16s - 62.32s] I'll show you a little tip for that in a

[59.60s - 64.72s] minute. And so where the body goes, the

[62.32s - 68.16s] hands and arms and club follow. So the

[64.72s - 69.92s] feeling is one moving part. We're just

[68.16s - 71.76s] turning the chest back from a great

[69.92s - 74.32s] posture position. Same grip as you'd use

[71.76s - 76.32s] in the full swing. Turn back. Turn

[74.32s - 79.84s] through. We collect the ball on the way

[76.32s - 79.84s] pass and send it in the right
