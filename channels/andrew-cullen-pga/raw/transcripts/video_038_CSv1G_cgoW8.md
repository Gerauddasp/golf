[0.96s] This was one of Anakah Senstöm's

[3.52s] signature moves and something that Tiger

[6.96s] used, something that Brooks is using,

[10.48s] something that Bryson's using and that

[12.64s] Rory's using, and so something that

[15.04s] maybe you should be using, and something

[17.04s] I teach on a daily basis to my clients.

[20.08s] So, let's explore how these great

[22.00s] players use their right arm from start

[24.88s] to strike in the swing to get club face

[27.84s] control, club path control, and some

[30.40s] effortless power to help you get the

[33.04s] same out of your game. I'm Andrew

[35.44s] Cullen. If you want to swing better,

[37.44s] think better, feel better, and golf

[40.40s] yourself to life, subscribe here.

[46.48s] So, let's deal with concept first of the

[48.72s] right arm. what its role is. Firstly, in

[51.20s] developing speed in the swing. So, we

[54.16s] have two movements of the right arm. As

[56.16s] we're swinging back, we create leverage.

[58.56s] Lever one, lever two, which like a

[60.72s] hammer motion is going to deliver speed

[63.44s] to the club head or hammerhead. So,

[65.52s] lever one will come out first, lever two

[67.76s] will come out second. And both are

[69.36s] creating speed in the hammerhead. So, in

[71.76s] the golf swing, the later we release

[74.00s] those levers, the more speed we're going

[76.56s] to generate through strike. And the

[78.40s] second is through rotation. So as the

[80.64s] arms are swinging back and the right

[82.64s] arm's bending, it's also rotating. And

[85.44s] that's going to help us create some

[87.12s] speed like a tennis player through

[88.88s] strike, rotating the arm back and then

[91.76s] rotating the arm through to create

[94.00s] speed. So, let's look at how we can

[96.48s] simply create leverage and rotation with

[101.20s] the beautiful addition, if we do that

[103.04s] correctly, of controlling the club face

[105.52s] and controlling the club path.

[108.56s] Let's focus on takeaway first and stick

[110.72s] around for a couple of minutes. I'll

[111.76s] give you a brilliant drill that I give

[113.60s] most of my students where they can

[115.52s] instantly get the feel for what we're

[117.44s] trying to do in the creation of leverage

[120.00s] and rotation to deliver more speed and

[122.96s] control. All right. So, Anakas or one of

[125.12s] Anakah's signature moves was keeping the

[127.60s] right arm straight for as long as

[130.08s] possible on the back swing. Not thinking

[132.08s] about left arm. That's the common one.

[134.08s] Right arm straight because if the right

[135.84s] arm straight, stays straight longer.

[138.48s] Easy for me to say.

[140.88s] Stay straight longer. It's going to fold

[144.00s] down and not back if it bends early. And

[147.92s] the folding down then starts to create

[150.96s] the rotation in the forearms. Again,

[154.56s] both power moves that we need on the way

[157.44s] down to deliver the club at speed on a

[160.48s] consistent swing path with control of

[163.04s] the club face. So, right arm straight as

[166.32s] long as you can, elbow bends down, arms

[169.76s] rotate. We've already got the momentum

[172.32s] to send the club flatter on the way

[174.96s] down. So, we get better coordination

[177.20s] between arms and body and more speed

[179.84s] through the body to the club head with

[182.16s] the critical move. Right arm straight as

[185.84s] long as you can at the start sets a

[188.64s] whole sequence of beautiful motion into

[192.08s] action.

[193.84s] So, here's a very simple drill I learned

[195.76s] from the brilliant Mike Adams,

[197.36s] biomechanics extraordinaire, where it's

[200.08s] just a back swing exercise. We basically

[202.56s] take your normal stance and grip

[204.72s] position, and then we open the right

[207.04s] hand up. And I really mean open it up. I

[209.52s] see some people cheating on this

[210.88s] exercise where they still try and wrap

[212.72s] the fingers around the grip. The whole

[214.56s] point is if we can make a back swing

[216.80s] with the right hand completely open, we

[219.68s] naturally get this longer straight arm,

[222.32s] elbow folding down, arms rotating

[225.68s] without having to manipulate anything.

[227.76s] So obviously, I hope the fault is that

[230.56s] we're pulling with the right hand.

[232.88s] Again, the elbow will fold back behind

[235.28s] you. We lose leverage and rotation. Very

[238.40s] difficult to create speed in the club

[240.40s] head and deliver the club from the right

[242.32s] direction. So, opening the right hand,

[245.60s] keeping just light contact between the

[247.68s] palm of your hand and the grip of the

[249.36s] club, and just making the back swing.

[252.32s] You'll start to feel how the body is

[254.96s] very engaged in the back swing. You'll

[257.76s] start to feel the elbow folding late and

[260.32s] downwards. And we get this lovely

[262.16s] rotation again of the arms and the

[264.08s] momentum of the club going to a flatter

[266.32s] plate on the way down. Beautiful

[269.12s] exercise. So, we've created the

[271.60s] conditions for beautiful delivery by

[274.48s] getting the right arm straight, longer,

[277.20s] folding down, arms rotating naturally as

[280.80s] long as we're moving the body properly

[282.40s] on the way down. Have a look at the link

[284.16s] to the video I'll put at the end from

[285.92s] Andreas Calli's beautiful description of

[288.40s] body position relative to the ball for

[290.32s] great strikes. But, we've got a delivery

[292.48s] position where we've got leverage and

[295.60s] rotation to deliver for effortless

[298.80s] speed. So, let's put it all together.

[301.76s] Beautiful setup. Right arm longer,

[304.64s] straight.

[306.80s] Beautiful delivery. Thanks for watching.

[310.24s] Let me know in the comments down below

[311.76s] how that brilliant Mike Adams exercise

[314.16s] is working for you, helping you get more

[316.16s] leverage and more rotation in the right

[318.48s] arm and getting you a few more yards.

[320.56s] Don't forget to check out the video here

[322.80s] on bringing your ball striking up to a

[325.28s] different level. Okay, let's just finish

[327.76s] up with a nice little easy right arm

[331.44s] rotation leverage.

[335.84s] Now we're talking.
