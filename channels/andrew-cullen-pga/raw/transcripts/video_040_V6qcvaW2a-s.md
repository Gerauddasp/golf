**[0.16s - 3.68s]**
I'm sure we'd all like to strike the

**[1.6s - 6.16s]**
ball as well and as far as our new open

**[3.68s - 9.72s]**
champion, Scotty Shestler, maybe without

**[6.16s - 9.72s]**
the fancy footwork.

**[11.04s - 17.2s]**
I don't know though. Nailed it. So, what

**[14.16s - 19.44s]**
one thing that Scotty does so well can

**[17.2s - 22.4s]**
you apply to your game to help you hit

**[19.44s - 25.12s]**
the ball more consistently and further?

**[22.4s - 27.44s]**
So, let's take a look at how to optimize

**[25.12s - 30.08s]**
the low point in the swing to help you

**[27.44s - 32.48s]**
strike the ball more consistently and

**[30.08s - 34.88s]**
more powerfully. I'll give you two easy

**[32.48s - 36.48s]**
technical fixes to get there. And stick

**[34.88s - 38.48s]**
around to the end. I'm going to give you

**[36.48s - 40.56s]**
three brilliant tips to help you

**[38.48s - 42.64s]**
instinctively strike the ball better,

**[40.56s - 45.2s]**
which you can instantly apply for

**[42.64s - 47.12s]**
greater success on the golf course. I'm

**[56.56s - 61.84s]**
I've been a PGA coach, an active

**[58.8s - 64.48s]**
tournament player for the last 35 years,

**[61.84s - 68.08s]**
for the last 10 of those years,

**[64.48s - 71.28s]**
playing seniors events. I see my role as

**[68.08s - 74.4s]**
a YouTube creator is to use my

**[71.28s - 76.24s]**
experience and some of the great lessons

**[74.4s - 81.12s]**
I've learned from the world's best

**[76.24s - 83.6s]**
teachers and players to help you

**[81.12s - 85.76s]**
get the best out of your game. And so to

**[83.6s - 89.6s]**
that end, I'm delivering today one of

**[85.76s - 94.08s]**
the key concepts of ball striking that I

**[89.6s - 97.04s]**
learned from the brilliant Andreas Cali,

**[94.08s - 99.04s]**
one of Denmark's top coaches. Link in

**[97.04s - 100.72s]**
the description below. So, let's get

**[99.04s - 102.96s]**
down and dirty with a little theory

**[100.72s - 104.64s]**
first. To be able to strike a golf ball

**[102.96s - 106.48s]**
off the ground, we need to get the

**[104.64s - 108.24s]**
leading edge hitting underneath the

**[106.48s - 110.08s]**
equator of the ball. And there we're

**[108.24s - 112s]**
going to meet the sweet spot which is

**[110.08s - 114.32s]**
usually round about the third, fourth,

**[112s - 116.96s]**
fifth groove on the club head. So we

**[114.32s - 119.6s]**
need to get the low point in the swing

**[116.96s - 122.08s]**
at the ball or just after the ball to

**[119.6s - 124.88s]**
make the leading edge hit at that point.

**[122.08s - 127.36s]**
So where the low point is in the swing

**[124.88s - 129.52s]**
is critical to striking the ball

**[127.36s - 132s]**
correctly. If we get the low point at

**[129.52s - 134s]**
the ball or slightly ahead of the ball,

**[132s - 136.4s]**
so target side of the ball, we're good

**[134s - 138.8s]**
to go. And if we get the low point

**[136.4s - 140.72s]**
behind the ball, we're in big trouble.

**[138.8s - 143.04s]**
We're going to get fat shots, thin

**[140.72s - 144.48s]**
shots, and then all sorts of corrections

**[143.04s - 146.64s]**
will try and make their way into the

**[144.48s - 149.84s]**
swing without getting to the root of the

**[146.64s - 153.68s]**
problem. And today, we get to the root

**[149.84s - 156s]**
of the horizontal low point problem. As

**[153.68s - 158.16s]**
we all know, the golf swing is a very

**[156s - 161.76s]**
complex movement. So, today we're

**[158.16s - 163.68s]**
dealing with the xaxis of where the low

**[161.76s - 166.48s]**
point is going to be in the swing. But

**[163.68s - 168.56s]**
there is also a yaxis up and down

**[166.48s - 170.4s]**
movement is going to influence the low

**[168.56s - 171.52s]**
point of the swing. And there's also

**[170.4s - 175.12s]**
because we're dealing in three

**[171.52s - 177.12s]**
dimensions a Z axis axis that's the club

**[175.12s - 179.28s]**
head could go further away from the body

**[177.12s - 181.6s]**
or closer to the body. And that's where

**[179.28s - 183.92s]**
you need a very skilled teacher to

**[181.6s - 186.08s]**
analyze your swing and tell you where

**[183.92s - 189.2s]**
you need to work. But the absolute

**[186.08s - 192.56s]**
non-negotiable in ball striking is with

**[189.2s - 195.36s]**
the x-axis. So, let's get into how we

**[192.56s - 199.44s]**
control the X-axis so we're delivering

**[195.36s - 201.6s]**
the club head at a consistent low point.

**[199.44s - 204.56s]**
So, in Andreas's beautiful description

**[201.6s - 206.64s]**
of low point concept horizontally, he

**[204.56s - 208.8s]**
talks about the center of the chest and

**[206.64s - 210.8s]**
the center of the pelvis relative to the

**[208.8s - 212.88s]**
ball. If we get that up level with the

**[210.8s - 215.12s]**
ball or ahead of the ball, the club

**[212.88s - 216.88s]**
starts to bottom out opposite that point

**[215.12s - 220s]**
and the club head will reach its lowest

**[216.88s - 222s]**
point opposite the uh left armpit where

**[220s - 224.16s]**
the diameter of the swing or the radius

**[222s - 226.88s]**
of the swing is at its greatest. So

**[224.16s - 229.44s]**
start of divot. So if you like center of

**[226.88s - 232.24s]**
chest, center of pelvis, deep point and

**[229.44s - 234.56s]**
divot opposite the left shoulder. So, if

**[232.24s - 236.72s]**
we're in a position behind the ball,

**[234.56s - 238.96s]**
center of chest or center of pelvis or

**[236.72s - 240.96s]**
both, we're going to start bottoming out

**[238.96s - 243.36s]**
in the wrong place. So, I'm going to

**[240.96s - 245.6s]**
give you two exercises now to help you

**[243.36s - 247.92s]**
get into a more shelffler position at

**[245.6s - 250.16s]**
strike where the center of the chest,

**[247.92s - 251.92s]**
the center of the pelvis are more

**[250.16s - 253.68s]**
opposite the ball at strike or even

**[251.92s - 255.52s]**
ahead of the ball at strike that we're

**[253.68s - 258.72s]**
going to bottom out in the right place

**[255.52s - 260.64s]**
and strike the ball pure.

**[258.72s - 262.48s]**
Okay, exercise number one. We need an

**[260.64s - 264.4s]**
alignment stick and a bit of grass

**[262.48s - 266.56s]**
rather than the driving range mat. We're

**[264.4s - 268s]**
going to take your normal setup position

**[266.56s - 270.48s]**
and then we're going to stick this

**[268s - 273.04s]**
alignment stick in the ground where your

**[270.48s - 276s]**
right leg is. So, it sits at a bit of a

**[273.04s - 278.48s]**
diagonal as we see. And basically, the

**[276s - 280.32s]**
first trick is to not move right. If I

**[278.48s - 282.24s]**
move too far right on the back swing,

**[280.32s - 284.8s]**
I'm making life very difficult for

**[282.24s - 287.04s]**
myself to get center of chest and center

**[284.8s - 289.6s]**
of pelvis back to the ball again. So if

**[287.04s - 291.84s]**
I imagine the right thigh bone as the

**[289.6s - 293.92s]**
axis of the swing for the back swing, so

**[291.84s - 297.12s]**
I'm not shifting off to the right hand

**[293.92s - 299.44s]**
side, then I make life much easier for

**[297.12s - 301.92s]**
myself on the down swing again to get

**[299.44s - 304.08s]**
center of chest, center of pelvis, level

**[301.92s - 305.6s]**
with the ball or ahead of the ball. So

**[304.08s - 308.56s]**
again, the right foot's right up against

**[305.6s - 311.92s]**
the stick. We avoid too much movement

**[308.56s - 315.2s]**
off to the right

**[311.92s - 317.52s]**
and then we make it easy for to you to

**[315.2s - 321.68s]**
move that center of pelvis, center of

**[317.52s - 324.16s]**
chest forwards, get ball first and divot

**[321.68s - 325.92s]**
second. So second technical move that

**[324.16s - 328s]**
again Andreas explains so well is what

**[325.92s - 331.2s]**
we call the skater move. So if you're on

**[328s - 333.44s]**
ice where to move forwards, we're

**[331.2s - 335.52s]**
pushing the back skate in the ground to

**[333.44s - 337.84s]**
move left. So obviously from a golf

**[335.52s - 340.72s]**
perspective, if we're pushing under the

**[337.84s - 342.48s]**
right foot to go left, the center of

**[340.72s - 344.48s]**
chest, center of pelvis is moving

**[342.48s - 346.88s]**
forward again and we're getting the low

**[344.48s - 348.4s]**
point in the right place. This is what

**[346.88s - 350.96s]**
you see again in Scotty Sheffller's

**[348.4s - 353.04s]**
swing. So exaggerated almost is he's

**[350.96s - 355.28s]**
already starting to move left. He's

**[353.04s - 356.88s]**
moved a long way left by the time we're

**[355.28s - 358.96s]**
coming in to strike the ball. That's why

**[356.88s - 360.48s]**
we get some funky footwork. There's so

**[358.96s - 361.92s]**
much pressure in the left foot. He

**[360.48s - 364.08s]**
doesn't want to fall over. So the left

**[361.92s - 365.84s]**
foot's going to do that to react. And

**[364.08s - 367.92s]**
obviously so far forward that the right

**[365.84s - 370.64s]**
foot's going to slide at the same time.

**[367.92s - 372.72s]**
So not necessarily recommended to do,

**[370.64s - 374.48s]**
but you get the idea of what we're

**[372.72s - 376.08s]**
trying to do to get pure ball strike.

**[374.48s - 378s]**
Okay. So let's go skater move. Let me do

**[376.08s - 379.84s]**
it in slow-mo first. So we're going to

**[378s - 381.76s]**
go back swing before the back swing is

**[379.84s - 384.16s]**
even complete. I'm starting to push

**[381.76s - 386.72s]**
under that right foot to go left and

**[384.16s - 388.88s]**
then center of chest, center of pelvis

**[386.72s - 391.52s]**
are in a very powerful position to

**[388.88s - 395.2s]**
strike ball divot. All right, shut up

**[391.52s - 397.12s]**
and do it. Here we go. So, skater move

**[395.2s - 400.84s]**
early push under the right foot before

**[397.12s - 400.84s]**
the back swing's complete.

**[400.96s - 407.04s]**
And again, we get ball first, ground

**[403.52s - 408.48s]**
second, deep divot underneath the left

**[407.04s - 410.4s]**
shoulder.

**[408.48s - 412.16s]**
If you're scrolling through YouTube and

**[410.4s - 414.32s]**
not finding the answers to your golfing

**[412.16s - 416.56s]**
questions, consider joining me at Buy Me

**[414.32s - 418.72s]**
a Coffee while I'll give you personal

**[416.56s - 420.96s]**
video answers to the most pressing

**[418.72s - 423.84s]**
points that you haven't found covered on

**[420.96s - 426.08s]**
this channel. Okay, I promised you three

**[423.84s - 428.16s]**
tips at the end to instinctively find

**[426.08s - 429.84s]**
that low point a bit easier. So, number

**[428.16s - 432.16s]**
one, obviously, I call the towel drill.

**[429.84s - 434.24s]**
We put our towel down on the ground. We

**[432.16s - 436.32s]**
measure about a club head's width with

**[434.24s - 438.24s]**
the ball from the towel. And obviously

**[436.32s - 440.4s]**
the goal is to try and miss the towel

**[438.24s - 443.28s]**
and hit the ball. So we're encouraging

**[440.4s - 445.12s]**
again center of pelvis and center of

**[443.28s - 447.44s]**
chest to be further forward at strike.

**[445.12s - 449.28s]**
So here we go. Miss the towel, hit the

**[447.44s - 452.08s]**
ball.

**[449.28s - 454.32s]**
Yeah. All right. Bonus tip number two.

**[452.08s - 456.16s]**
What I call hit some small So get

**[454.32s - 458.8s]**
a little broken tea or something like

**[456.16s - 461.04s]**
that. We place that four or 5 cm ahead

**[458.8s - 464.08s]**
of the ball. And again, we're trying to

**[461.04s - 466s]**
trust your instinct to look at and hit

**[464.08s - 468.32s]**
the tea away. and obviously collecting

**[466s - 470.56s]**
the ball on the way past. So my eyes are

**[468.32s - 473.2s]**
not on the ball. My eyes are on the tee

**[470.56s - 474.72s]**
just in front of the ball from start to

**[473.2s - 478s]**
strike. So I'm just trying to hit the

**[474.72s - 480.64s]**
ball and tee away

**[478s - 482.88s]**
disappeared. Beautiful. So again,

**[480.64s - 484.96s]**
instinctively getting the low point in

**[482.88s - 486.96s]**
the right place. And bonus tip number

**[484.96s - 490.32s]**
three and the progression from the first

**[486.96s - 493.36s]**
two is do it without any help. So no

**[490.32s - 495.76s]**
towel, no tea, but the eyes are still

**[493.36s - 497.76s]**
ahead of the ball rather than on the

**[495.76s - 500.24s]**
ball. It can also sometimes give you a

**[497.76s - 502.24s]**
mental freedom because we're not

**[500.24s - 504s]**
thinking of the hit. We're actually just

**[502.24s - 506.64s]**
trying to get the low point in the right

**[504s - 508.16s]**
place. So from start to strike, I'm not

**[506.64s - 510.56s]**
looking at the ball. I'm looking at a

**[508.16s - 512.8s]**
bit of grass just three or four cm ahead

**[510.56s - 516.32s]**
of the ball. And so the low point is

**[512.8s - 519.68s]**
focused at that point instinctively.

**[516.32s - 521.28s]**
There he is. low point for

**[519.68s - 524.24s]**
and beautifully struck out the middle of

**[521.28s - 527.12s]**
the bat. Many, many more potentially

**[524.24s - 528.56s]**
gamechanging tips in this video here.

**[527.12s - 530.08s]**
Thanks for watching. If you want to put

**[528.56s - 532.56s]**
your comments below, let me know how you

**[530.08s - 534.32s]**
got on with that. In the meantime, I'm

**[532.56s - 536.64s]**
going to put Mr. Callie's brilliant

**[534.32s - 538.24s]**
teaching into action. All right, skater

**[536.64s - 539.92s]**
boy. Let's get moving before the back

**[538.24s - 542.08s]**
swing's finished.

**[539.92s - 546.72s]**
Oh,

**[542.08s - 546.72s]**
that four iron is absolutely nailed.
