[0.16s - 6.88s] Tip number two, short left thumb or long

[4.72s - 8.96s] left thumb. Neither are wrong. There's

[6.88s - 10.88s] advantages and disadvantages to both.

[8.96s - 13.28s] So, let me start with short thumb. If

[10.88s - 15.44s] you have problems with overswinging or

[13.28s - 18.24s] you have problems with tendonitis or

[15.44s - 21.04s] tennis elbow or golfer's elbow, I would

[18.24s - 23.60s] recommend going short thumb. Why?

[21.04s - 25.76s] Because short thumb position on the grip

[23.60s - 27.68s] is going to help support the club up at

[25.76s - 30.00s] the top of the swing. The right hand's

[27.68s - 32.24s] there to support as well. So because

[30.00s - 34.88s] that weight of the club and the momentum

[32.24s - 36.88s] of the club is easily spread over both

[34.88s - 38.72s] arms, we get less pressure on the left

[36.88s - 41.60s] arm than we would with a long thumb

[38.72s - 43.60s] position. So it's helpful in over

[41.60s - 45.60s] swings. So I got much more control of

[43.60s - 47.28s] the swing. If I suddenly went long,

[45.60s - 48.80s] that's going to happen. Also, what

[47.28s - 50.24s] happened can happen with long thumb is

[48.80s - 52.32s] we start to get less control of the

[50.24s - 55.04s] wrist, open the club face. So we got

[52.32s - 57.20s] much less uh direction control with a

[55.04s - 59.20s] long thumb usually than we do with short

[57.20s - 61.84s] thumb. So if that's your problems, I

[59.20s - 64.40s] would go short thumb on the grip to get

[61.84s - 66.64s] more control of the club face up to the

[64.40s - 68.80s] top of the back swing. But if distance

[66.64s - 70.40s] is your problem, we need to get a little

[68.80s - 73.44s] bit more leverage up at the top of the

[70.40s - 75.52s] swing. So we go longer thumb position.

[73.44s - 77.36s] That again is going to help you get more

[75.52s - 80.16s] wrist angle up at the top of the swing,

[77.36s - 82.48s] create more leverage in the left arm and

[80.16s - 85.04s] the right arm, which will help create

[82.48s - 86.64s] more speed on the way down. We just have

[85.04s - 89.28s] to be careful with that long thumb

[86.64s - 90.64s] position that we're not changing wrist

[89.28s - 92.64s] angles up to the top of the swing.

[90.64s - 95.04s] Again, the danger would be that we go

[92.64s - 96.80s] too far. We start to use the lose the

[95.04s - 98.72s] wrist control in that direction which

[96.80s - 100.24s] opens the club face up and then we're

[98.72s - 103.12s] going to get another compensation on the

[100.24s - 105.44s] way down. So, I rarely recommend that

[103.12s - 107.68s] unless distance is a big problem and we

[105.44s - 111.12s] need to try and find bits of speed in

[107.68s - 111.12s] all different parts of the swing.

Tip number two, short left thumb or long left thumb. Neither are wrong. There's advantages and disadvantages to both. So, let me start with short thumb. If you have problems with overswinging or you have problems with tendonitis or tennis elbow or golfer's elbow, I would recommend going short thumb. Why? Because short thumb position on the grip is going to help support the club up at the top of the swing. The right hand's there to support as well. So because that weight of the club and the momentum of the club is easily spread over both arms, we get less pressure on the left arm than we would with a long thumb position. So it's helpful in over swings. So I got much more control of the swing. If I suddenly went long, that's going to happen. Also, what happened can happen with long thumb is we start to get less control of the wrist, open the club face. So we got much less uh direction control with a long thumb usually than we do with short thumb. So if that's your problems, I would go short thumb on the grip to get more control of the club face up to the top of the back swing. But if distance is your problem, we need to get a little bit more leverage up at the top of the swing. So we go longer thumb position.

So, I rarely recommend that unless distance is a big problem and we need to try and find bits of speed in all different parts of the swing.
