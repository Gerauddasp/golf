**[0.24s]** Tip number one, finding your natural

**[3.12s]** left hand position. Now, let&#39;s ignore

**[5.6s]** for a minute the two knuckles V to the

**[7.839s]** right shoulder as it was in the

**[9.36s]** textbooks because not everybody&#39;s the

**[12.08s]** same. You see that on the tour. Matthew

**[14.08s]** Fitzpatrick super super strong grip with

**[16.64s]** the left hand. Dustin Johnson super

**[18.88s]** super strong grip. They&#39;re great

**[20.64s]** players. They don&#39;t have two knuckles

**[22.24s]** showing. They&#39;ve got about four knuckles

**[23.6s]** showing. So did the great Bernard

**[24.96s]** Langanger in his time. So this is the

**[27.359s]** first step in finding your most uh

**[30.64s]** suitable left hand position. Stand

**[33.04s]** straight up. Let the arms hang. There it

**[35.84s]** is. So you&#39;ll see that the hands don&#39;t

**[38.399s]** hang parallel to the body. They hang

**[40.96s]** turned in. So there&#39;s step number one.

**[43.36s]** This is your natural position. What&#39;s

**[45.44s]** not talked about much is how the left

**[48.16s]** hand position on the club is going to

**[50.96s]** affect the rotation of the arm. And the

**[54s]** rotation of the arm is what delivers the

**[56.879s]** club head back to square or not as the

**[60.559s]** case may be. So the easiest way to find

**[63.199s]** your first step in natural grip position

**[65.68s]** is let the hands hang. Already put the

**[68.479s]** club on the ground, aim towards your

**[70.32s]** target. Just wrap your fingers around

**[73.04s]** how the hand hangs. And this will be the

**[76.08s]** first indication of how you&#39;ve got to

**[78.88s]** hold the club. Whether that&#39;s two

**[80.56s]** knuckles, two and a half knuckles, three

**[82.56s]** knuckles, maybe you&#39;ve got gorilla

**[84.32s]** hands, maybe we&#39;re on to four knuckles,

**[86.32s]** doesn&#39;t matter. That&#39;s the way you&#39;re

**[88.64s]** going to get natural rotation. Where the

**[91.439s]** left forearm starts is where the left

**[94.24s]** forearm wants to return. So that

**[96.799s]** rotation affects the club face. So if

**[99.6s]** I&#39;m going to go into an unnatural

**[102s]** position, weak grip, the arm will rotate

**[105.52s]** this way coming into strike to get its

**[107.52s]** natural position. and the club face

**[109.04s]** opens and I&#39;ve got to invent all sorts

**[111.36s]** of compensations to get the ball

**[112.72s]** starting on the right target line.

**[114.56s]** Equally, if for me I go gorilla, which

**[117.28s]** is not the natural, and the left hands

**[119.28s]** on top, then the arm&#39;s likely to over

**[122.079s]** rotate, close the club face, and start

**[124.399s]** the ball off to the left hand side. So

**[126.56s]** step one, tip one, find your natural

**[129.599s]** left hand grip position by letting the

**[132.239s]** left arm hang.

Tip number one, finding your natural left hand position. Now, let&#39;s ignore for a minute the two knuckles V to the right shoulder as it was in the textbooks because not everybody&#39;s the same. You see that on the tour. Matthew Fitzpatrick super super strong grip with the left hand. Dustin Johnson super super strong grip. They&#39;re great players. They don&#39;t have two knuckles showing. They&#39;ve got about four knuckles showing. So did the great Bernard Langanger in his time. So this is the first step in finding your most uh suitable left hand position. Stand straight up. Let the arms hang. There it is. So you&#39;ll see that the hands don&#39;t hang parallel to the body. They hang turned in. So there&#39;s step number one. This is your natural position. What&#39;s not talked about much is how the left hand position on the club is going to affect the rotation of the arm.

That&#39;s the way you&#39;re going to get natural rotation. Where the left forearm starts is where the left forearm wants to return. So that rotation affects the club face. So if I&#39;m going to go into an unnatural position, weak grip, the arm will rotate this way coming into strike to get its natural position. and the club face opens and I&#39;ve got to invent all sorts of compensations to get the ball starting on the right target line.
