[0.16s - 3.92s] Step number three, balance point or

[2.00s - 6.00s] where the pressure is under your feet.

[3.92s - 8.08s] So you could get the first two parts

[6.00s - 10.48s] really good here. Have great posture,

[8.08s - 12.56s] but if the weight's too much into your

[10.48s - 14.56s] toes, we're going to have problems as

[12.56s - 18.64s] soon as you start swinging the club. The

[14.56s - 21.44s] body never wants to fall over. So it

[18.64s - 24.08s] will always react to bad balance. So, if

[21.44s - 26.56s] I'm in a good posture position, but my

[24.08s - 29.04s] weight's gone into the toes, then as

[26.56s - 30.88s] soon as I start swinging that club, then

[29.04s - 33.36s] the the body's going to start losing

[30.88s - 35.36s] balance. So, it will react. And the way

[33.36s - 37.04s] it reacts if the balance is too far

[35.36s - 39.20s] forward in the toes or the pressure is

[37.04s - 40.96s] too far forward is the body will stand

[39.20s - 42.16s] up and now we're a different distance

[40.96s - 43.52s] away from the ball. So, it's going to

[42.16s - 45.68s] make it pretty difficult to hit on the

[43.52s - 47.76s] way down. Equally, if we get the

[45.68s - 49.60s] beautiful posture position, but we're

[47.76s - 51.68s] sitting back in the heels too much,

[49.60s - 53.28s] again, with a good start to the swing,

[51.68s - 55.44s] the body is going to react because it

[53.28s - 57.52s] does not want to fall over. So, it'll

[55.44s - 59.44s] react by moving forward. So, we're

[57.52s - 61.44s] getting closer to the ball now, and we

[59.44s - 63.20s] got a bit of a chance of chunking it.

[61.44s - 66.24s] So, we got to put the pressure

[63.20s - 68.40s] underneath the balls of your feet so

[66.24s - 70.64s] that the body doesn't have to react to

[68.40s - 72.56s] losing balance. So once we got our

[70.64s - 74.56s] posture position,

[72.56s - 77.12s] you want to feel the pressure underneath

[74.56s - 79.68s] the front of your shoelaces. So as soon

[77.12s - 82.64s] as I start to swing, it's very easy to

[79.68s - 85.68s] keep my balance point. So I'm not I'm

[82.64s - 88.24s] easy to control my posture from start to

[85.68s - 90.88s] strike because the body is not under

[88.24s - 92.48s] threat of using its balance. And if you

[90.88s - 94.40s] like to make it even more specific, once

[92.48s - 97.04s] you've got that balance, think of the

[94.40s - 99.76s] point behind your belt buckle, basically

[97.04s - 102.64s] your point of most mass or your center

[99.76s - 106.16s] of gravity. And the more stable we can

[102.64s - 108.08s] keep that point from start to strike,

[106.16s - 110.32s] the more chance you have of keeping your

[108.08s - 112.72s] distance to the ball as you're swinging.

[110.32s - 115.92s] I like to tell my customers, imagine a

[112.72s - 117.44s] glass of beautiful primitivo wine

[115.92s - 119.84s] sitting in the middle of your stomach

[117.44s - 121.76s] and try not to spill a drop as you're

[119.84s - 124.08s] swinging the club. So that's the last

[121.76s - 125.92s] one. Balance point. Make sure you got

[124.08s - 127.76s] your beautiful posture, weight

[125.92s - 129.44s] distributed underneath the balls of your

[127.76s - 132.32s] feet. So, we're going to make it nice

[129.44s - 135.28s] and easy to keep your body stable as

[132.32s - 135.28s] you're swinging the golf

So, if I'm in a good posture position, but my weight's gone into the toes, then as soon as I start swinging that club, then the the body's going to start losing balance. So, it will react. And the way it reacts if the balance is too far forward in the toes or the pressure is too far forward is the body will stand up and now we're a different distance away from the ball. So, it's going to make it pretty difficult to hit on the way down.
