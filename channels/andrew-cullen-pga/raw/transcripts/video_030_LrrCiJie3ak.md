[0.00s] All right, number two, radius. Let's

[1.52s] keep this super simple. By keeping the

[4.08s] hands the same distance away from me,

[6.80s] start to strike, I maximize the radius

[10.40s] of the club head and therefore maximize

[12.48s] the speed in the club head. We're also

[14.88s] then connected between the upper arms

[17.20s] and the upper body from start to finish.

[19.68s] You might have noticed in the initial

[21.84s] videos when I just turned the shoulders

[23.84s] and got my arms swinging, we're also

[25.84s] disconnecting here. So very difficult to

[28.88s] get the torque working for you with the

[31.76s] body to the arms because the arms are

[33.52s] not connected to the body. You'll also

[36.00s] see if the arms stay wide wide they will

[38.96s] tend to work downwards. So we don't need

[40.80s] to necessarily pull the club downwards

[43.04s] or let it fall downwards. If we keep the

[45.44s] radius then we tend to get naturally

[48.08s] that motion and that creates a lot of

[50.40s] leverage and rotation in the right arm

[52.64s] which again is going to create lots of
