[0.08s] Putting tip number 17 of 100, putting

[4.00s] from the fringe. How do I get the pace

[6.32s] right? I'd always recommend putting from

[8.40s] the fringe rather than chipping or

[9.84s] pitching. Worst putt is always better

[12.40s] than worst chip, but getting the pace

[14.48s] right is difficult. Here is a brilliant

[16.56s] tip I learned from a Phil Mickelson

[18.16s] video some years ago where we're just

[20.24s] feeding the subconscious the information

[22.64s] it needs to get on and get the pace

[24.72s] right. So I'd go through my normal

[26.96s] routine setting up little bit of right

[29.76s] to left in this one. And now rather than

[32.64s] looking at whole ball whole ball and

[35.68s] reacting I need an extra piece of

[37.68s] information. So we need to get the eyes

[40.08s] looking at the the edge of the green

[42.40s] where the fringe meets the green and

[44.40s] then to the hole and back to the ball.

[46.88s] Fringe hole ball go. So, we're feeding

[50.64s] the subconscious the critical piece of

[52.96s] information of how we're going to get

[55.28s] more resistance from the fringe grass

[57.44s] than when the ball's on the green. All

[59.20s] right, shut up and do it. I'll do that.

[61.36s] So, let's aim up.

[64.88s] So, we look at edge of the fringe, hole,

[67.76s] ball. Edge of the fringe, hole, ball,

[70.88s] go. We've fed the subconscious the right

[73.12s] information,

[75.52s] and we bless Phil for all the tips he's

[77.84s] given us over the years. Many thanks for

[79.92s] watching. I'm Andrew Cullen. This is

Putting tip number 17 of 100, putting from the fringe. How do I get the pace right? I'd always recommend putting from the fringe rather than chipping or pitching. Worst putt is always better than worst chip, but getting the pace right is difficult. Here is a brilliant tip I learned from a Phil Mickelson video some years ago where we're just feeding the subconscious the information it needs to get on and get the pace right. So I'd go through my normal routine setting up little bit of right to left in this one. And now rather than looking at whole ball whole ball and reacting I need an extra piece of information. So we need to get the eyes looking at the the edge of the green where the fringe meets the green and then to the hole and back to the ball. Fringe hole ball go. So, we're feeding the subconscious the critical piece of information of how we're going to get more resistance from the fringe grass than when the ball's on the green. All right, shut up and do it. I'll do that. So, let's aim up. So, we look at edge of the fringe, hole, ball. Edge of the fringe, hole, ball, go. We've fed the subconscious the right information, and we bless Phil for all the tips he's given us over the years. Many thanks for watching. I'm Andrew Cullen. This is Cough Yourself to Life.
