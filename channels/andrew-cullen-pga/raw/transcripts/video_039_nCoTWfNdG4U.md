[0.16s - 4.96s]
Basically, the first trick is to not

[2.64s - 6.88s]
move right. If I move too far right on

[4.96s - 9.20s]
the back swing, I'm making life very

[6.88s - 11.12s]
difficult for myself to get center of

[9.20s - 13.52s]
chest and center of pelvis back to the

[11.12s - 16.00s]
ball again. So, if I imagine the right

[13.52s - 18.24s]
thigh bone as the axis of the swing for

[16.00s - 21.52s]
the back swing, so I'm not shifting off

[18.24s - 24.00s]
to the right hand side, then I make life

[21.52s - 26.16s]
much easier for myself on the down swing

[24.00s - 28.56s]
again to get center of chest, center of

[26.16s - 30.24s]
pelvis level with the ball or ahead of

[28.56s - 33.12s]
the ball. So again, the right foot's

[30.24s - 36.56s]
right up against the stick. We avoid too

[33.12s - 40.16s]
much movement off to the right.

[36.56s - 42.80s]
Oh, and then we make it easy for to you

[40.16s - 48.88s]
to move that center of pelvis, center of

chest forwards. Get ball first and divot
