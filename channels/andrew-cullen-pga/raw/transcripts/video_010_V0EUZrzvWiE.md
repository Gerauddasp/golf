[0.08s - 6.40s] But if we keep the upper body soft,

[3.04s - 8.48s] hands soft, that sequencing takes place

[6.40s - 10.56s] much more naturally. And that's the

[8.48s - 13.52s] whole point of what you'll see in Scotty

[10.56s - 16.72s] Sheffller swing. Mouth slightly open to

[13.52s - 19.04s] try and relax the upper body so the

[16.72s - 21.12s] sequencing is easier. So, let me hit a

[19.04s - 23.36s] couple of shots for you. One, I'll just

[21.12s - 25.92s] do full view and then we'll focus in on

[23.36s - 28.64s] my face and show you my Scotty Sheffler

[25.92s - 31.28s] game face. So, mouth slightly open. Here

[28.64s - 31.28s] we go.

[32.16s - 36.64s] So we get a beautiful sequence in the

[34.88s - 38.96s] throwing motion. All right. So let's

[36.64s - 41.20s] focus in on meller face. So again, mouth

[38.96s - 43.84s] is just very slightly open. So no

[41.20s - 46.00s] nothing of the teeth, no tension here.

[43.84s - 48.16s] Relaxes the shoulders, hands, and arms.

[46.00s - 49.68s] And then gets the sequencing much easier

[48.16s - 53.00s] without having to think about it. So

[49.68s - 53.00s] mouth open.

[55.04s - 59.44s] Also helps to smile. and nailed it.
