[0.08s - 3.20s] All right, drill number one. We're going

[1.44s - 4.48s] to get your very expensive training aid.

[3.20s - 6.72s] We're going to stick it in the end of

[4.48s - 8.56s] the grip and we're going to point this

[6.72s - 10.32s] tee for as long as you can on the back

[8.56s - 11.84s] swing to your right pocket. And then

[10.32s - 14.80s] it's going to flip and it's going to

[11.84s - 16.08s] point to or just outside the ball.

[14.80s - 17.92s] Depends a little bit what club you're

[16.08s - 20.48s] playing. I'll show you Lin Grant's

[17.92s - 23.44s] beautiful swing based on this movement

[20.48s - 25.68s] as we go. All right. So, first of all,

[23.44s - 28.16s] on the takeaway, we're going to get this

[25.68s - 30.40s] tee pointing to your right pocket. Right

[28.16s - 33.84s] pocket. right pocket for as long as you

[30.40s - 36.72s] can. And then as the right arm folds, as

[33.84s - 39.60s] the right arm rotates, that tee is going

[36.72s - 41.60s] to change its position to the ball ball.

[39.60s - 44.32s] So now you see what's happening with my

[41.60s - 47.12s] right elbow. We're really delivering

[44.32s - 48.96s] that speed, getting the energy through

[47.12s - 51.20s] the body to the club head with the

[48.96s - 54.48s] connection, and we're getting leverage

[51.20s - 56.80s] and rotation in the right arm. So the T

[54.48s - 58.96s] goes to the right pocket, the T flips to

[56.80s - 61.20s] the ball. So we get this very clear

[58.96s - 63.52s] picture in your head where we've got to

[61.20s - 66.52s] go to get your beautiful delivery

[63.52s - 66.52s] position.

[67.36s - 71.60s] Yeah.

[69.20s - 71.60s] Mailed.
