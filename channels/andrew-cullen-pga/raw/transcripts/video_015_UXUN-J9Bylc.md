**[0.00s - 5.20s]**
Wouldn't it be great if the ball was

**[2.40s - 6.80s]**
just a bit bigger?

**[5.20s - 11.28s]**
Then we would all make a much more

**[6.80s - 13.12s]**
instinctive throwing motion. Woohoo.

**[11.28s - 14.48s]**
Without worrying too much about whether

**[13.12s - 17.04s]**
we're going to hit the ball or not

**[14.48s - 19.52s]**
because the body instinctively knows how

**[17.04s - 22.40s]**
to create speed in a projectile. Take

**[19.52s - 24.88s]**
the javelin for example. Run up, plant

**[22.40s - 27.20s]**
the front foot in the ground, push back,

**[24.88s - 29.36s]**
creates rotation and breaking, and then

**[27.20s - 32.08s]**
all the speed comes behind it with the

**[29.36s - 35.04s]**
upper body and the arm swing. Baseball

**[32.08s - 37.28s]**
pitcher, same thing. Big step forward,

**[35.04s - 39.28s]**
pushing the ground for rotation and

**[37.28s - 41.20s]**
breaking, and all the momentum and the

**[39.28s - 43.92s]**
speed comes behind them from the upper

**[41.20s - 46.80s]**
body and arm swing. So, we need to be

**[43.92s - 49.92s]**
throwing our projectile at the ball with

**[46.80s - 52.00s]**
the same elements.

**[49.92s - 54.24s]**
But because the ball's so small and

**[52.00s - 56.64s]**
lying on the ground waiting for us, it's

**[54.24s - 59.04s]**
way more difficult to do. So, we need to

**[56.64s - 61.20s]**
do this from a static position. But the

**[59.04s - 63.92s]**
elements of the down swing are the same.

**[61.20s - 66.16s]**
We need to plant the weight on that left

**[63.92s - 69.28s]**
side. For the right hand golfer, we need

**[66.16s - 71.84s]**
to push in the ground to create rotation

**[69.28s - 75.04s]**
and breaking. And the braking will help

**[71.84s - 77.68s]**
the momentum of the upper body and arms

**[75.04s - 80.64s]**
create speed on the way through. So in

**[77.68s - 83.92s]**
this video, we are going to plant and

**[80.64s - 85.92s]**
push to help you hit the ball way

**[83.92s - 89.04s]**
further.

**[85.92s - 92.08s]**
Woo! I'm Andrew Cullen. If you want to

**[89.04s - 95.20s]**
swing better, think better, sharpen up

**[92.08s - 98.92s]**
your short game, golf yourself to life,

**[95.20s - 100.96s]**
and subscribe here.

**[100.96s - 104.72s]**
Okay, so we're going to look at the two

**[102.56s - 107.20s]**
steps to making the right body movement

**[104.72s - 108.80s]**
on the down swing. Planting the foot in

**[107.20s - 111.04s]**
the ground, front foot in the ground,

**[108.80s - 113.04s]**
and pushing under the front foot to

**[111.04s - 114.96s]**
create all that power and momentum

**[113.04s - 117.68s]**
behind with the upper body and arm

**[114.96s - 120.56s]**
swing. So the first step I like to call

**[117.68s - 123.28s]**
glide phase. Beautiful expression and

**[120.56s - 125.92s]**
beautifully described and I'll explain

**[123.28s - 127.68s]**
why as we go. One of the big problems in

**[125.92s - 130.08s]**
the golf swing was a kind of

**[127.68s - 132.88s]**
misinterpretation from Ben Hogan's book

**[130.08s - 135.04s]**
and something that I did wrong for many

**[132.88s - 138.32s]**
many years was get to the top of the

**[135.04s - 140.48s]**
back swing and then try and turn before

**[138.32s - 143.84s]**
the weights even planted onto that front

**[140.48s - 147.12s]**
foot. Not very powerful and we're liable

**[143.84s - 149.12s]**
to get steep and usually from outside.

**[147.12s - 151.12s]**
So turning from the top of the back

**[149.12s - 153.12s]**
swing is kind of the wrong

**[151.12s - 155.12s]**
interpretation of what Mr. Hogan

**[153.12s - 157.20s]**
actually did. And what Mr. Hogan

**[155.12s - 160.56s]**
actually did was actually he was on this

**[157.20s - 162.32s]**
left side before the rotation came. So

**[160.56s - 163.92s]**
this is what I like to call glide phase.

**[162.32s - 165.52s]**
I learned it from an Australian pro.

**[163.92s - 167.36s]**
Can't remember his name. Sorry for the

**[165.52s - 170.08s]**
plagiarism,

**[167.36s - 172.40s]**
but it's a beautiful description of what

**[170.08s - 175.04s]**
should actually happen as the back swing

**[172.40s - 177.20s]**
is completing. It's already happening.

**[175.04s - 179.28s]**
Moving forward is already happening

**[177.20s - 180.88s]**
before the back swing's complete. So

**[179.28s - 182.16s]**
glide phase would look something like

**[180.88s - 183.84s]**
this. And I've just got the stick in the

**[182.16s - 187.12s]**
ground to show you there. So it's on my

**[183.84s - 190.64s]**
right leg, right hip as we go back. And

**[187.12s - 193.36s]**
glide phase is between sort of halfway

**[190.64s - 195.84s]**
3/4 back and how the down swing is

**[193.36s - 198.88s]**
already starting as the upper body is

**[195.84s - 201.20s]**
moving forward. So as Andreas Ki taught

**[198.88s - 204.08s]**
me, the brilliant Andreas Ki taught me,

**[201.20s - 207.04s]**
it's like the right pocket is moving

**[204.08s - 209.76s]**
towards your target before the top of

**[207.04s - 211.92s]**
the back swing is complete. So, let me

**[209.76s - 213.44s]**
show you one or two of those. So, I got

**[211.92s - 215.28s]**
I'll show you in slow motion first of

**[213.44s - 218.08s]**
all. So, it's going to go something like

**[215.28s - 221.12s]**
this. So, I'm already moving off the

**[218.08s - 223.84s]**
stick before the back swing is complete

**[221.12s - 226.00s]**
glide phase. And obviously, I've got

**[223.84s - 228.64s]**
like the javelin thrower, like the

**[226.00s - 230.88s]**
baseball pitcher. I'm planted. I've got

**[228.64s - 232.80s]**
my weight already on that left side, and

**[230.88s - 234.88s]**
I'm ready to create lots of speed and

**[232.80s - 236.80s]**
momentum in the upper body by using the

**[234.88s - 239.84s]**
ground properly. All right. So, let me

**[236.80s - 241.20s]**
show you one. So foot's on the stick. So

**[239.84s - 242.96s]**
outside of the foot's on the stick,

**[241.20s - 244.56s]**
right hips on the stick. And you'll see

**[242.96s - 246.32s]**
again up at the top of the back swing

**[244.56s - 248.08s]**
before the top of the back swing, my

**[246.32s - 251.08s]**
right hip starts to move towards the

**[248.08s - 255.60s]**
target.

**[255.60s - 260.48s]**
Yeah. Glide phase. I just want to show

**[258.80s - 262.72s]**
you glide phase in the down the line

**[260.48s - 264.56s]**
view because it can solve a myriad of

**[262.72s - 267.04s]**
problems. One of the other problems that

**[264.56s - 269.04s]**
comes out of trying to turn too early is

**[267.04s - 272.00s]**
we get some early extension. I was a

**[269.04s - 273.92s]**
chronic early extender through most of

**[272.00s - 275.12s]**
my playing career. Somehow managed to

**[273.92s - 277.20s]**
deal with it like the great Jack

**[275.12s - 279.76s]**
Nicholas and Johnny Miller did, but very

**[277.20s - 282.72s]**
difficult to repeat get a repeatable

**[279.76s - 285.04s]**
powerful swing. So glide phase again

**[282.72s - 287.04s]**
just moving the right pocket towards the

**[285.04s - 289.68s]**
target before the back of the swing is

**[287.04s - 291.84s]**
complete can really prevent the pelvis

**[289.68s - 293.60s]**
from moving forward. If I get the weight

**[291.84s - 295.68s]**
onto the left side and pushing the

**[293.60s - 298.08s]**
ground, the pelvis is going to go rather

**[295.68s - 299.68s]**
back rather than towards the ball if I'm

**[298.08s - 301.44s]**
trying to turn too early. So, let me

**[299.68s - 304.56s]**
show you slow-mo and then we'll go into

**[301.44s - 307.36s]**
full speed motion again. So, here's

**[304.56s - 309.52s]**
again half to 3/4. My right pocket is

**[307.36s - 311.92s]**
now going to move left or towards the

**[309.52s - 314.32s]**
target. So, the weight is planted on the

**[311.92s - 315.36s]**
left side. And then from there, and

**[314.32s - 317.68s]**
we'll go into the next phase in a

**[315.36s - 319.44s]**
minute. If I just push the pelvis again,

**[317.68s - 321.44s]**
it's going to stay that same distance

**[319.44s - 323.60s]**
from the ball. So belt buckle to ball

**[321.44s - 326.40s]**
distance won't get shorter. It'll if

**[323.60s - 328.08s]**
anything get further away. So no early

**[326.40s - 330.40s]**
extension. All right, let's try and show

**[328.08s - 332.48s]**
you that with the ball. So again, I'm

**[330.40s - 334.64s]**
just thinking of moving the right pocket

**[332.48s - 337.28s]**
just a little bit towards the target

**[334.64s - 339.28s]**
before the back swing's finished. So

**[337.28s - 343.84s]**
Scotty Sheffler style, I'm well ahead

**[339.28s - 347.36s]**
of the ball at strike. All right.

**[343.84s - 349.20s]**
Who nailed it? If you're scrolling

**[347.36s - 350.72s]**
through YouTube and not finding the

**[349.20s - 353.12s]**
answers to your golfing questions,

**[350.72s - 355.44s]**
consider checking me out at Buy Me a

**[353.12s - 357.52s]**
Coffee, where my members ask me

**[355.44s - 360.48s]**
questions and I give them their answers

**[357.52s - 362.96s]**
in video format and the library of all

**[360.48s - 365.52s]**
these videos grow so you can get access

**[362.96s - 367.52s]**
to all that information. See you and buy

**[365.52s - 370.32s]**
me a coffee.

**[367.52s - 371.92s]**
Step two, push. So, we've glided

**[370.32s - 373.68s]**
beautifully before the back swing's

**[371.92s - 375.60s]**
finished. We've got pressure in the

**[373.68s - 378.00s]**
ground under the left side. Now we got

**[375.60s - 380.08s]**
to use the ground. So equal and opposite

**[378.00s - 383.36s]**
forces in physics. The harder we push

**[380.08s - 386.08s]**
down, the more power energy we get back.

**[383.36s - 390.00s]**
And that energy translates into

**[386.08s - 393.20s]**
rotational energy in the hips and upward

**[390.00s - 395.20s]**
force. Both things creating more speed

**[393.20s - 398.40s]**
in what's coming behind you, the upper

**[395.20s - 400.40s]**
body, arms, and club head. Now, to an

**[398.40s - 403.28s]**
extent, we don't need to get too

**[400.40s - 406.08s]**
technical here because if you've glided,

**[403.28s - 407.52s]**
the body never wants to fall over. So,

**[406.08s - 410.48s]**
it's not going to keep going left and

**[407.52s - 412.96s]**
keep going left. It's going to react.

**[410.48s - 415.20s]**
And the reaction is to push in the

**[412.96s - 416.88s]**
ground to save balance. So, to an

**[415.20s - 419.04s]**
extent, these forces will come

**[416.88s - 420.96s]**
naturally, but we can go a little Scotty

**[419.04s - 423.36s]**
Sheffler style. So, the reason Scotty

**[420.96s - 425.04s]**
Sheffler is jumping about is because

**[423.36s - 426.80s]**
he's pushing so hard in the ground. And

**[425.04s - 429.44s]**
you'll see that a lot with long drive

**[426.80s - 432.00s]**
champions particularly. So once we've

**[429.44s - 434.08s]**
got there, we just push and everything

**[432.00s - 435.60s]**
else should fall into place. All right,

**[434.08s - 439.44s]**
here we go. Let me just show you a

**[435.60s - 442.76s]**
couple here. So glide and push. Glide

**[439.44s - 443.28s]**
and push.

**[443.28s - 446.24s]**
Nailed it again. Beautiful.

**[446.24s - 450.32s]**
All right, once more from down the line.

**[447.60s - 452.40s]**
Slow-mo. So I'm going to glide and then

**[450.32s - 454.16s]**
push in the ground as hard as I can.

**[452.40s - 456.72s]**
Okay, here we go. This is what's going

**[454.16s - 460.20s]**
to create a lot more club head speed in

**[456.72s - 463.20s]**
your golf swing.

**[463.20s - 465.44s]**
Really was nailed.

**[465.44s - 471.96s]**
If you're wondering now how to optimize

**[467.44s - 471.96s]**
your back swing for this down swing,

**[472.88s - 476.72s]**
then check out this video here.
