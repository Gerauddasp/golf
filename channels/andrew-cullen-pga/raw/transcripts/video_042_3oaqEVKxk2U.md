[0.24s - 5.52s] Putting tip number 25 of 100. Getting

[3.2s - 7.2s] more confidence on those nasty little

[5.52s - 9.2s] five-footers. What we used to hold

[7.2s - 11.92s] Dennis Wises. You Chelsea fans will know

[9.2s - 16.16s] that one. So we find a 5-ft straight

[11.92s - 18.56s] putt. We put a tee into the ground where

[16.16s - 20.48s] we want the ball to roll over. So here

[18.56s - 22.16s] obviously right on the edge of the hole.

[20.48s - 24.08s] Don&#39;t need any training aids. Get a tea,

[22.16s - 27.68s] stick them in the ground. Okay. Right.

[24.08s - 31.52s] So my focus is totally on trying to roll

[27.68s - 33.28s] the ball over the pink tea. So that&#39;s my

[31.52s - 35.28s] what I&#39;m looking at when I&#39;m looking up

[33.28s - 37.44s] at the hole and what I&#39;m keeping the

[35.28s - 39.76s] picture of in my head as I&#39;m swinging

[37.44s - 42.32s] back and through. Missed it. It&#39;s left

[39.76s - 45.76s] of the pink tea. And obviously because

[42.32s - 48.32s] I&#39;m focusing on such a small zone, such

[45.76s - 50.0s] a small thing to hit that I&#39;m still able

[48.32s - 52.64s] to hold the putt right again. Pink tea.

[50.0s - 55.04s] Let&#39;s try and hit it this time. Try and

[52.64s - 57.6s] avoid the flies on my sunglasses. Yes.

[55.04s - 59.12s] Okay. Over the pink tea. And number

[57.6s - 62.4s] three

[59.12s - 65.44s] in the name of the great Dennis Wise.

[62.4s - 67.52s] Pink tea.

[65.44s - 69.76s] Oh, two out of three. That&#39;s the way to

[67.52s - 72.32s] get your confidence up on those nasty

[69.76s - 75.52s] little 5-footers. I&#39;m Andrew Cullen and
