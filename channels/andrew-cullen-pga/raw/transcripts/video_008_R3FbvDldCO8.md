[0.32s] All the best players in the world

[2.08s] through the ages regardless of their

[4.72s] back swing position have got their right

[7.36s] elbow pointing down towards the ground

[10.08s] in the delivery position. So why do they

[13.36s] do that? Well, first of all, it connects

[15.92s] the arms to the body. So the energy that

[18.72s] the body is creating is transmitted out

[21.60s] towards the club head and it creates

[24.64s] leverage and rotation in the right arm

[27.52s] which we're going to deliver to create a

[30.00s] lot of speed and great directional

[32.48s] control in the club head.

[36.56s] Oh boom. So do you have to keep your

[39.92s] elbows together from start to strike in

[42.32s] the swing to get that delivery position?

[45.36s] Huh? No. Or do you have to get your

[48.48s] right elbow coming in close to your body

[50.72s] on the way down to get that delivery

[53.04s] position? Huh? No. So, how do we get you

[57.44s] using your swing into this? Oh, yeah.

[61.60s] Worldass delivery position. Let me show

[64.48s] you two very easy drills using this very

[68.40s] expensive training aid

[70.96s] in this video. I'm Andrew Cullen. If you

[84.00s] Let's start with highlighting two common

[86.24s] problems I see with amateur golfers

[89.12s] trying to get into this magic delivery

[91.68s] position. Right elbow pointing to and

[93.76s] towards the ground. First of all, they

[95.60s] think the elbows are going to be

[96.88s] together and hold them together. We saw

[99.92s] Mr. Shiffler, if he doesn't do it, it's

[102.80s] probably not absolutely necessary. And

[104.64s] the big problem, and I want you to be

[106.32s] aware of this, is that pushing the

[108.64s] elbows together can often bring the

[110.72s] shoulder joint forward. Whenever we get

[113.76s] very unnatural movements or positions in

[116.56s] the golf swing, we open ourselves up to

[119.52s] injury. So, be careful here. If we

[122.16s] isolate the shoulder joint in the swing,

[124.16s] we put too much stress on the shoulder

[125.68s] joint. If we grip too tight with the

[128.32s] left hand, particularly for the

[129.92s] right-hand golfer, we can get problems

[132.00s] with the tendons or tennis elbow or

[134.16s] golfer's elbow. If we overdo side bend,

[137.76s] then we can get potential back problems.

[140.24s] If we start in a position that's

[142.24s] unnatural with the right arm, that can

[144.56s] open ourselves up to injury. I've worked

[146.64s] with many osteopaths and

[148.96s] physiootherapists over my whole career.

[151.84s] And so, I'm very aware of potential

[153.84s] golfing injuries. If you want to build a

[157.28s] powerful, efficient, and healthy swing,

[160.32s] then I suggest you subscribe to this

[162.40s] channel. Second mistake I often see is

[165.12s] amateurs trying to get that right elbow

[167.76s] tucking into that right pocket. And all

[170.00s] we do is reduce the radius in the swing

[172.72s] and reducing radius reduces speed in the

[176.08s] club head. So, let me show you two very

[179.20s] efficient, effective, and natural drills

[182.24s] to get you into your best delivery

[186.16s] position. All right, drill number one.

[188.40s] We're going to get your very expensive

[189.68s] training aid. We're going to stick it in

[191.28s] the end of the grip and we're going to

[193.04s] point this tee for as long as you can on

[195.44s] the back swing to your right pocket. And

[197.36s] then it's going to flip and it's going

[198.88s] to point to or just outside the ball.

[201.92s] Depends a little bit what club you're

[203.28s] playing. I'll show you Lynn Grant's

[205.12s] beautiful swing based on this movement

[207.68s] as we go. All right. So, first of all,

[210.64s] on the takeaway, we're going to get this

[212.88s] tee pointing to your right pocket. Right

[215.36s] pocket, right pocket for as long as you

[217.60s] can. And then as the right arm folds, as

[220.96s] the right arm rotates, that tee is going

[223.92s] to change its position to the ball ball.

[226.80s] So, now you see what's happening with my

[228.72s] right elbow. We're really delivering

[231.52s] that speed, getting the energy through

[234.32s] the body to the club head with the

[236.16s] connection, and we're getting leverage

[238.40s] and rotation in the right arm. So, the

[241.12s] tea goes to the right pocket, the tea

[243.44s] flips to the ball. So, we get this very

[245.76s] clear picture in your head where we've

[248.08s] got to go to get your beautiful delivery

[250.72s] position.

[254.56s] Yeah.

[256.40s] mailed.

[267.20s] questions, consider joining me at Buy Me

[269.68s] a Coffee, where I will give you video

[271.92s] answers to your questions to get you on

[274.40s] the right path as quickly as possible.

[276.64s] All for the tiny fee of $10 a month.

[281.44s] All right, tip number two. We're going

[283.12s] to grab your tea again. We're gonna open

[285.28s] up your glove. We're gonna stick the tee

[288.32s] just where the Velcro overlaps into you

[291.28s] there. So, the tea is gonna point

[293.76s] upwards. If you've got a friend to help

[297.60s] you do this, it can help a little bit.

[299.68s] But basically, we want the tea pointing

[301.68s] like that. Okay. So, what's the point in

[304.24s] this exercise? Again, it's all about

[306.24s] playing with the pictures in your head.

[308.16s] If we get the picture, we can get the

[309.92s] feel. If we can get the feel, we can do

[311.60s] the movement. All right. So basically

[313.44s] what's going to happen up to the top of

[315.20s] the swing. So again, whether you're

[316.72s] flying right elbow or beautiful

[318.40s] position, what we want to happen now is

[321.28s] we want the tea to point skywards. Or if

[324.96s] you haven't got a tee or you don't wear

[326.16s] a glove, get your watch pointing

[327.68s] skywards. All right. So you'll see

[329.68s] what's happening here as I go through

[332.32s] whether I get a Sheffller position where

[334.24s] the elbow's slightly behind me, a Freddy

[336.48s] Couples position where he's really up

[338.08s] behind me. The point now is we try and

[342.32s] get the left hand or the again the tea

[345.44s] pointing up in the air. That gets the

[347.28s] right arm folding down and again we're

[349.68s] into beautiful delivery position. So

[352.88s] often the problem with uh amateur

[355.76s] golfers particularly those of you who

[357.28s] had trouble with steep swing I did for

[359.44s] many years used to have whole of problem

[361.52s] with the left arm because the loading is

[364.24s] onto the left arm when the swing comes

[366.00s] down steep. And if we're able to

[368.48s] flatten, then we distribute the weight

[371.28s] over the two arms and we get into a much

[373.60s] better delivery position. So the picture

[375.60s] again is to try and get the tea from

[378.56s] back swing pointing up in the air and

[381.44s] then we're ready to smash it on the way

[384.00s] down. So the picture in my head

[388.00s] whether I'm into beautiful position

[390.72s] again what I said at the start with

[392.48s] elbows together. Sure, it can help as

[395.12s] long as the shoulders don't go forward.

[396.80s] The elbows stay together. Is this easier

[399.28s] to do? Absolutely. So, I'm not against

[401.92s] that whatsoever. Just be careful you

[404.08s] don't get your shoulders forward. But

[405.68s] whatever you are, flying right elbow or

[407.92s] elbows together without the shoulders

[409.68s] together. We want to get this position

[411.60s] of the left hand up up up and then we're

[415.28s] in beautiful delivery. Okay, let's show

[417.52s] you one to finish up here. So, I'm just

[421.28s] picturing where the tea is through

[423.52s] transition pointing up in the air.

[427.76s] Yes, there he is.
