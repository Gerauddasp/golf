[0.48s - 6.88s] Putting tip number one of 100. Keep your

[4.40s - 9.44s] booty still. If the butt stays still

[6.88s - 12.00s] from start to strike in the swing, we

[9.44s - 14.32s] get much more reliability of swing path

[12.00s - 17.12s] and we're able to send the ball off in

[14.32s - 20.64s] the desired direction. Oh, go on my son.

[17.12s - 23.60s] Go on. Go on. Go on.

[20.64s - 27.12s] I'm Andrew Gullen and this is Golf

[23.60s - 30.48s] Yourself to Life putting tip number two

[27.12s - 32.72s] of 100. This could be the solution to

[30.48s - 34.72s] missing short putts. A lot of the

[32.72s - 36.64s] problems with short putts comes from

[34.72s - 38.88s] just looking up a little too early,

[36.64s - 41.60s] changing the swing path, changing the

[38.88s - 44.88s] club face orientation and pulling or

[41.60s - 47.12s] pushing putts. So by balancing your two

[44.88s - 49.20s] frank piece, your tempense piece, your

[47.12s - 51.60s] looney or your ton if you're listening

[49.20s - 54.64s] in Canada on the back of your neck as a

[51.60s - 56.40s] practice, just get used to that feeling

[54.64s - 59.04s] that point on the back of your neck

[56.40s - 60.72s] staying nice and still. start to strike,

[59.04s - 62.72s] then the swing path is going to stay

[60.72s - 64.80s] much more consistent. And when you get

[62.72s - 66.80s] on the golf course, just keep focusing

[64.80s - 69.92s] on that point on the back of your neck

[66.80s - 72.48s] to get beautiful, smooth, consistent

[69.92s - 74.56s] swing path. Putting tip number three,

[72.48s - 76.24s] your 100. If you're struggling with your

[74.56s - 78.80s] distance control, lacking a little bit

[76.24s - 80.56s] of feel, keep your forearms soft. Don't

[78.80s - 82.32s] worry too much about your grip pressure.

[80.56s - 84.56s] Forearms soft. Something I learned from

[82.32s - 86.64s] the brilliant Brad Faxon out in Florida

[84.56s - 89.20s] some years ago. So you go through your

[86.64s - 91.36s] normal routine. Beautiful setup. Read

[89.20s - 94.24s] the putt beautifully. All right. So

[91.36s - 96.48s] forearms soft start to strike. You get a

[94.24s - 101.36s] lovely pendulum motion. Lovely feedback

[96.48s - 104.40s] and feel and better dis Oh, do it.

[101.36s - 106.48s] Better distance control. Much more fun

[104.40s - 110.48s] when you're putting. Putting tip number

[106.48s - 113.76s] four of 100. Putt from your sternum.

[110.48s - 116.72s] What the hell am I talking about? Most

[113.76s - 118.88s] putters players I see are trying to rock

[116.72s - 120.88s] their shoulders or stay connected with

[118.88s - 122.88s] the arms and it's all a bit robotic and

[120.88s - 125.44s] the head tends to waggle about. Whereas

[122.88s - 128.16s] if we putt from the sternum, a very

[125.44s - 129.84s] small movement here can make a big

[128.16s - 132.56s] movement to the shoulders. So we just

[129.84s - 134.96s] got to make a very simple, very small

[132.56s - 136.96s] movement from the sternum to actually

[134.96s - 138.64s] get the club moving. And we can stay

[136.96s - 140.32s] connected with the arms. The shoulders

[138.64s - 142.40s] are definitely going to rock, but I'm

[140.32s - 144.88s] not thinking about trying to rock the

[142.40s - 147.84s] shoulders. We're just trying to move the

[144.88s - 150.80s] sternum to move the putter back and move

[147.84s - 154.08s] the putter through. Perfectly simple

[150.80s - 158.08s] stroke. If you want the next 96 putting

[154.08s - 162.00s] tips, subscribe here. Putting tip number

[158.08s - 164.72s] five of 100. Imagine the hole is like a

[162.00s - 167.28s] clock face to help you visualize break

[164.72s - 169.36s] putts. So here I've got a right to left

[167.28s - 171.28s] putt. The ball should be dropping in the

[169.36s - 174.72s] hole at 4:00. If it was dead straight,

[171.28s - 177.20s] it'd be 6:00. Left to right 7 8 or 9:00.

[174.72s - 179.60s] So every time I'm looking at the hole in

[177.20s - 181.84s] my setup position, I'm imagining the

[179.60s - 184.88s] ball dropping over the edge of the hole

[181.84s - 188.48s] at 4:00. So we read the putt right to

[184.88s - 190.48s] left, pick a start line. So now I've

[188.48s - 192.56s] aimed up to start the ball right. I'm

[190.48s - 195.92s] now going to imagine the ball dropping

[192.56s - 198.16s] over at 4:00. 4:00. I go back to the

[195.92s - 200.32s] ball with that picture, let it happen,

[198.16s - 204.08s] and in she comes.

[200.32s - 208.32s] 4:00. Welcome to putting tip number six

[204.08s - 211.44s] of 100. Avoid the disaster setup

[208.32s - 214.24s] position. I've never ever ever, let me

[211.44s - 216.88s] emphasize this, ever seen anybody putt

[214.24s - 219.60s] well from this position where the eyes

[216.88s - 221.36s] are beyond the ball. So, the way to

[219.60s - 222.96s] check this, grab a second ball for the

[221.36s - 225.76s] right-hander, stick it in your left

[222.96s - 227.76s] pocket, make your setup position, and

[225.76s - 230.96s] drop that second ball from your left

[227.76s - 234.32s] eye. If we're over the ball, perfect.

[230.96s - 236.32s] Oh, we're slightly inside the ball.

[234.32s - 238.64s] That's fine. Club's going to work itself

[236.32s - 242.56s] inside, square, inside, or inside down

[238.64s - 244.80s] the line. But never ever

[242.56s - 247.04s] ey I line this side of the ball.

[244.80s - 248.88s] Disaster. I've never ever seen anybody

[247.04s - 250.96s] pop well from there because the club

[248.88s - 252.96s] wants to go in this direction and then

[250.96s - 254.88s] it's every compensation to try and get

[252.96s - 257.28s] the club moving in the right direction.

[254.88s - 260.24s] So often check your ey line, your eye

[257.28s - 262.48s] position relative to the ball inside or

[260.24s - 265.44s] on it is good and then we can make quite

[262.48s - 269.12s] a natural putt from inside to square and

[265.44s - 272.64s] down the line. Putting tip number seven

[269.12s - 275.28s] of 100. If you get a little bit yippy on

[272.64s - 277.60s] these short putts, it's usually cuz you

[275.28s - 279.84s] can't control the right hand movement.

[277.60s - 282.40s] And maybe you've tried everything to try

[279.84s - 285.84s] and cure that hands the wrong way round,

[282.40s - 288.56s] claw grips, and nothing's working. Here

[285.84s - 291.84s] is a brilliant tip I learned from Mike

[288.56s - 294.16s] Kansky, top putting coach on the tour

[291.84s - 296.80s] and coached a Windham Clark, where the

[294.16s - 299.04s] right hand sits on the wrong side of the

[296.80s - 301.84s] grip for the right-hand golfer. And we

[299.04s - 304.00s] get this beautiful pendulum motion of

[301.84s - 306.80s] the shoulders without the right hand

[304.00s - 308.88s] getting too active. So you take your

[306.80s - 310.72s] normal setup, you stick your right hand

[308.88s - 312.72s] around the wrong side of the putter. You

[310.72s - 316.00s] get a beautiful pendulum motion of the

[312.72s - 317.76s] shoulders and no yippy yippiness. For

[316.00s - 320.40s] all you yippers out there, hope that

[317.76s - 324.40s] solves your big problem. Putting tip

[320.40s - 326.96s] number eight of 100. Don't decelerate

[324.40s - 329.28s] even on the nastiest little downhill

[326.96s - 331.60s] right to lefter. We need a positive

[329.28s - 333.92s] stroke because if we put the brakes on,

[331.60s - 336.48s] we tend to twist the club face about and

[333.92s - 338.88s] often don't get the pace right. So, how

[336.48s - 341.92s] do we fool the brain into making a

[338.88s - 344.48s] positive swing? Look at the front of the

[341.92s - 347.52s] ball and not the back of the ball. So,

[344.48s - 350.08s] if I focus my eyes on the logo around

[347.52s - 351.76s] the front, I'm fooling the brain into

[350.08s - 353.92s] thinking that this is where the strike

[351.76s - 356.72s] is, but it comes earlier. So, we tend to

[353.92s - 358.24s] see a much more positive stroke. So,

[356.72s - 361.28s] particularly if you got some of these

[358.24s - 362.96s] nasty little downhill breaking putts,

[361.28s - 365.28s] put the logo of the ball around the

[362.96s - 367.84s] front. Fix your eyes on the front of the

[365.28s - 370.00s] ball and just keep your eyes fixed on

[367.84s - 372.40s] that point. Start to strike and then we

[370.00s - 375.04s] tend to see a much more positive swing

[372.40s - 378.00s] through to keep the club face on line.

[375.04s - 381.04s] Keep the swing path the same. Putting

[378.00s - 383.12s] tip number nine of 100. Here's a great

[381.04s - 384.80s] exercise for developing your feel for

[383.12s - 387.52s] distance control if that's what you're

[384.80s - 389.20s] struggling with. where I hit the putt. I

[387.52s - 391.60s] don't look to see where the ball's gone.

[389.20s - 393.92s] I ask myself if it's too short, right

[391.60s - 395.68s] distance, or long before looking up to

[393.92s - 398.40s] see what's actually happened. So, I'm

[395.68s - 400.96s] really focusing on the strike to get my

[398.40s - 403.52s] feedback. All right. So, read the putt,

[400.96s - 405.68s] set up, go.

[403.52s - 407.52s] That's a little bit short, maybe even a

[405.68s - 409.92s] little bit right.

[407.52s - 411.60s] Yep. Just about short and right. Okay,

[409.92s - 414.16s] let's go from a little longer. Always do

[411.60s - 417.52s] this from distant different distances.

[414.16s - 420.00s] Okay, so it's a left to righter again.

[417.52s - 423.44s] Aim up beautifully. Hit the putt. Don't

[420.00s - 425.68s] look at it.

[423.44s - 429.48s] Oh, that feels good. That might even be

[425.68s - 433.12s] in. I think it's the right distance.

[430.64s - 435.84s] That's how to develop very quickly your

[433.12s - 438.40s] sense of feel and distance control. Hit

[435.84s - 440.16s] the putt, get the feedback, guess

[438.40s - 442.24s] whether you're correct or not. You'll be

[440.16s - 443.84s] surprised how often your guess gets

[442.24s - 447.76s] better and better the more you do this

[443.84s - 450.64s] exercise. Putting tip number 10 of 100.

[447.76s - 452.48s] If you ignore all the other 99 golden

[450.64s - 455.20s] nuggets I'm going to give you on this

[452.48s - 457.44s] putting tip course, don't ignore this

[455.20s - 460.48s] one. This is going to make you whole out

[457.44s - 462.72s] way better from one meter. So, what I

[460.48s - 464.64s] call a drill around the clock. We're

[462.72s - 466.48s] going to start with a short straight

[464.64s - 468.40s] putt to build your confidence and then

[466.48s - 470.80s] we're going to go around the clock. I'll

[468.40s - 473.12s] explain as I go. So, first thing here, I

[470.80s - 476.40s] want a bit of a slope. So, I've got four

[473.12s - 478.24s] positions measured at 1 m from the hole.

[476.40s - 480.64s] I'm going to start with dead straight,

[478.24s - 482.48s] slightly up the hill. No training aids

[480.64s - 484.80s] required. Just lay the flag down on the

[482.48s - 487.28s] ground. So, you can check whether your

[484.80s - 490.56s] club face is square. You can see the

[487.28s - 492.56s] curve that the putter is going to make

[490.56s - 494.32s] relative to the flag. So, whether you

[492.56s - 496.96s] got a good stroke going or not, you'll

[494.32s - 500.48s] see if the putter goes outside in,

[496.96s - 503.76s] inside out, or waggling about. So, we're

[500.48s - 506.00s] just trying to confirm great aim. We're

[503.76s - 508.64s] trying to confirm great swing. So, once

[506.00s - 511.04s] I've done that a few times, I know my

[508.64s - 516.32s] stroke is good. It's time to go around

[511.04s - 518.88s] the clock. So, I got four positions

[516.32s - 520.72s] here.

[512.80s - 523.36s] Uphill 1 meter, downhill 1 m, right to

[518.88s - 526.80s] left 1 m, left to right 1 meter. So,

[520.72s - 529.12s] we're not ignoring any of the brakes.

[523.36s - 531.44s] And personally, I go around the clock

[526.80s - 536.32s] five times, 20 putts. I got to make 17

[529.12s - 538.40s] putts from 20 before I'm allowed to go

[533.60s - 542.80s] for my lunch. Why do you think I look so

[536.32s - 545.12s] slim? All right, so we're going to go

[540.96s - 549.28s] show you the four from different sides.

[542.80s - 552.08s] Very important you go through the same

[546.80s - 554.16s] routine every single time. So, it's

[549.28s - 558.40s] exactly how it is on the golf course.

[552.08s - 561.84s] So, short, straight, putt. My confidence

[554.16s - 565.04s] is already up on that one, so that one

[558.40s - 568.56s] should go in. All right. So, right to

[561.84s - 575.68s] left, you're going to see my ass here.

[565.04s - 577.92s] So, sorry about that. But again, one of

[568.56s - 580.80s] the putting tips we've already had on

[573.28s - 584.24s] this series, keep your ass still crucial

[577.92s - 587.12s] to getting a good consistent stroke. So,

[580.80s - 589.28s] 1 m right to left. Now, we got a nasty

[584.24s - 594.64s] little downhiller. 1 m.

[587.12s - 598.80s] Pretty straight, though. So, if I aim up

[589.28s - 601.76s] well and just set the ball rolling, he

[591.92s - 604.00s] should roll down the hill. Ignore the

[594.64s - 606.16s] fly on the ball. Get the ball rolling.

[598.80s - 607.76s] There he goes. And last one. Left to

[601.76s - 610.64s] righter again. Same approach. Same

[604.00s - 607.76s] visualiz visualisation. Seeing where the

[606.16s - 610.64s] ball goes in the hole before I go ahead

[607.76s - 610.64s] and do it

[609.28s - 610.64s] like it. Four out of four. I'm on course

[610.64s - 610.64s] for getting my 17 out of 20. The most

[610.64s - 610.64s] powerful putting drill that I know. I

[610.64s - 610.64s] have changed people's handicaps with

[610.64s - 610.64s] this drill. If you've not subscribed to
