[0.0s] So, let's deal with torque first. I was

[2.0s] taught as a wee laddy in Scotland by

[3.6s] male pro, turn your shoulders, laddy.

[5.839s] Turn your shoulders. Well, I've since

[8.08s] learned that that is not the most

[9.679s] powerful or effective method to create

[12.0s] speed in the club head. And I since

[13.92s] learned from the brilliant Mike Adams

[15.599s] and Terry Rolls, a biomechanist

[18.48s] extraordinaire, that we need to be

[20.64s] rotating the whole rib cage on the back

[23.359s] swing

[25.199s] rather than just turning the shoulders

[27.039s] on the back swing to create more tension

[29.679s] in the body and more radius in the arm

[32.239s] swing. So, here's the best thought for

[34.8s] trying to torque up. So, we're thinking

[37.52s] of a point in the middle of your rib

[39.28s] cage, and we're trying to stretch that

[41.68s] as far away from the ball as possible.

[44.96s] So, here's just shoulder turn. Let me

[47.52s] get my club out of the way. Shoulder

[49.28s] turn,

[51.68s] torque. So, rib cage turn. Big

[55.039s] difference in the two in the radius we

[58.32s] create and the power we're storing up in

[60.96s] the body to explode on the down swing.
