[0.08s - 4.24s] Let&#39;s start with tip number one. What I

[1.92s - 6.64s] call tee to the right pocket. What the

[4.24s - 8.96s] hell am I talking about? So, we grab the

[6.64s - 10.64s] grip end of your club. We stick the tee

[8.96s - 13.52s] in that end of the club. And we&#39;re going

[10.64s - 15.12s] to try and point this tee to your right

[13.52s - 17.04s] pocket for the righthander. Sorry,

[15.12s - 18.72s] lefties. Just think in reverse. To the

[17.04s - 20.96s] right pocket for as long as you can.

[18.72s - 22.80s] This is straight out of David Le better

[20.96s - 25.60s] a swing, which I thought was a brilliant

[22.80s - 27.20s] book. And this move does a lot of

[25.60s - 29.44s] things. For the purposes of what we&#39;re

[27.20s - 32.24s] doing today, you&#39;re going to see how it

[29.44s - 35.20s] makes the swing naturally upright on the

[32.24s - 37.44s] back swing to naturally flatter on the

[35.20s - 39.20s] way through just by focusing on where

[37.44s - 42.24s] the te&#39;s pointing. So, let me show you

[39.20s - 43.60s] in slowmo first of all. So, normal setup

[42.24s - 45.76s] and then I&#39;m going to try and think on

[43.60s - 47.92s] the takeaway of getting this tee to the

[45.76s - 49.84s] right pocket and it&#39;s going to stay

[47.92s - 52.80s] pointing at the right pocket for as long

[49.84s - 55.04s] as I can. So you see how much the chest,

[52.80s - 57.36s] the whole uh rib cage has to turn on the

[55.04s - 60.96s] back swing. The beautiful coordination

[57.36s - 62.80s] between club, hands, arms and body. Now

[60.96s - 64.24s] at some point the right shoulder is

[62.80s - 65.84s] going to get closer to the grip than the

[64.24s - 68.40s] left shoulder. So the right arm has to

[65.84s - 70.88s] fold. And as it folds, it&#39;ll rotate. So

[68.40s - 73.20s] the tee starts to point round to the

[70.88s - 75.28s] ball and then stays pointing at the ball

[73.20s - 77.44s] as long as you can on the way down. So

[75.28s - 80.32s] you see the the the method and the

[77.44s - 82.40s] madness here from the throw swing is if

[80.32s - 84.80s] I go tee to the right pocket, I&#39;m

[82.40s - 86.64s] automatically getting this upright

[84.80s - 88.88s] swing. I&#39;m not trying to swing it

[86.64s - 91.52s] upright. I&#39;m just turning the whole rib

[88.88s - 93.84s] cage tee to the right pocket. And then

[91.52s - 95.76s] as we go through transition, the beauty

[93.84s - 98.32s] here and the reason that you might feel

[95.76s - 100.72s] that we need less back swing is it makes

[98.32s - 103.44s] the arm swing very compact. I&#39;m very

[100.72s - 105.52s] much attached upper arms to upper body.

[103.44s - 108.32s] As the arm folds, it&#39;s going to fold

[105.52s - 110.56s] late and more downwards. That keeps the

[108.32s - 112.80s] arm swing nice and compact. And that

[110.56s - 115.12s] flattening again helps with the rotation

[112.80s - 118.72s] of your arms and to help swing the club

[115.12s - 121.20s] from inside with power. So, you might

[118.72s - 123.92s] well feel it&#39;s a slightly shorter arm

[121.20s - 125.92s] swing swing, but we&#39;re not trying to

[123.92s - 128.16s] swing shorter. We&#39;re actually building a

[125.92s - 130.00s] way better coordination between the arm

[128.16s - 132.32s] swing and the body swing. Right, let&#39;s

[130.00s - 134.72s] put it into action. So, we do another

[132.32s - 136.64s] little slow practice swing. So, a right

[134.72s - 138.56s] tee to right pocket. Sorry, T right

[136.64s - 140.80s] pocket. Right pocket, right pocket

[138.56s - 142.40s] flips. And then we&#39;re going to come

[140.80s - 145.84s] beautifully from inside. All right, here

[142.40s - 150.92s] we go. Just to focusing on the tea to

[145.84s - 151.20s] get a natural throwing motion.

[151.20s - 156.64s] Oh,

[153.60s - 156.64s] beautiful little baby
