Putting tip number 21 of 100. Lag

[4.08s - 9.20s]
putting. Lag schmag. Why on earth would

[7.12s - 11.68s]
you try and miss the hole? My take on it

[9.20s - 14.80s]
is if you&#39;re always visualizing a

[11.68s - 17.68s]
successful outcome from wherever you are

[14.80s - 18.88s]
on the green, however far away you are,

[17.68s - 20.96s]
then you&#39;re going to get your

[18.88s - 24.32s]
instinctive distance control right.

[20.96s - 26.56s]
Anyway, so I&#39;ve got a little bit right

[24.32s - 28.72s]
to left putt here. So, if I&#39;m imagining

[26.56s - 31.28s]
the hole, the ball should be dropping in

[28.72s - 34.08s]
at 5:00 here. So, if I&#39;m just imagining

[31.28s - 36.80s]
the ball dying over the edge of the hole

[34.08s - 38.56s]
at 5:00, my lag&#39;s going to be beautiful.

[36.80s - 40.16s]
Lag schmag. Just trying to hold

[38.56s - 42.72s]
everything. So, here we go. Little bit

[40.16s - 44.96s]
of right to left. I don&#39;t even know how

[42.72s - 48.00s]
far that is. It must be at least 25 m

[44.96s - 50.88s]
away. So, aiming up. All right. Full

[48.00s - 52.64s]
focus on the feel at strike to get the

[50.88s - 55.60s]
distance right. Ball&#39;s going to drop in

[52.64s - 57.84s]
at 5:00.

[55.60s - 59.68s]
That&#39;s a pretty good pace. So, it&#39;s

[57.84s - 61.76s]
coming down the hill now. It&#39;s going to

[59.68s - 65.40s]
turn left a little. Oh, we got a chance.

[61.76s - 66.00s]
Go on, my son.

[66.00s - 70.48s]
Definitely a gimme. Was I trying to lag

[68.48s - 71.84s]
it? Was I? Hell, I&#39;m trying to hold it.

[70.48s - 74.48s]
We got to try and hold it from

[71.84s - 77.60s]
everywhere to try and get your pace

[74.48s - 81.80s]
right. I&#39;m Andrew Cullen and this is

[77.60s - 81.80s]
Golf Yourself to Life.
