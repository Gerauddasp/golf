[0.32s] Putting tip number 22 of 100 in your

[3.20s] pre-shot routine. See a successful

[5.76s] outcome multiple times. So, let me show

[8.48s] you what I mean in my routine. So, I

[10.40s] read the putt. First of all, it&#39;s left

[12.24s] to right. Ball should drop in the hole

[14.08s] at 8:00. So, I&#39;ve already hold it once

[17.04s] as a picture in my head. Okay. So, I go

[19.76s] straight to the ball. Don&#39;t make a

[20.96s] practice swing. So, line the club up.

[24.08s] Line my body to the club. Right. So, I&#39;m

[26.16s] going to make two more looks at the

[27.36s] hole. But on both loops, I&#39;m holding it.

[29.52s] So, look number one, I&#39;ve hold it at

[31.20s] 8:00. Look number two, hold it at 8:00,

[34.24s] let it go. The less time there is

[36.40s] between the last look and just getting

[38.40s] on with it, the better. Oh, and it could

[39.84s] be

[44.56s] the more you visualize, the more focused

[47.44s] the picture is, the more chance you have

[49.52s] of holding the putt from anywhere. Hope

[52.16s] you get on well with that. I&#39;m Andrew

[53.76s] Cullen and this is Golf Yourself to

[57.12s] Life.
