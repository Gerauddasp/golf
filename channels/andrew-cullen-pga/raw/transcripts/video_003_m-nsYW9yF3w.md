[0.4s] Stop missing fairways. In this video,

[3.84s] I've got three quick setup wins that

[6.4s] will instantly tighten up your driver

[8.96s] game. No gimmicks. No, you've got to

[11.2s] swing it like this guy here. Yeah. Yeah.

[14.32s] No, never going to happen. Just real

[16.48s] setup science based on anatomy and

[19.119s] physics to get you fixing your slices,

[22.32s] controlling your fades and draws, and

[24.88s] finally owning the tea box.

[29.439s] Oh yeah. So, let's get into this. I'm

[32.399s] Andrew Cullen. If you want to swing

[34.399s] better, think better, score better, and

[36.8s] golf yourself to life, subscribe here.

[43.28s] All right, quick physics lesson. First

[44.96s] of all, it's critical to understand why

[47.68s] the ball flies, where it flies to get

[50.8s] the most out of these three wins I'm

[52.48s] going to give you. So, we're going to

[54s] look at club face first of all, and then

[56.64s] we're going to look at club path second

[59.359s] of all. So, imagine this white line as

[61.44s] my chosen target line. The yellow line

[64.08s] will represent the club face. So, if I

[66.32s] swing the club around myself and then

[68.64s] bring the club face back to square at

[71.2s] impact, then we're going to send the

[73.2s] ball along your target line. If the club

[76.32s] face, as I swing back down towards

[78.88s] strike, is open. So pointing right of

[82.64s] target then the ball is going to start

[86.4s] towards the right of target. And

[89.84s] hopefully obviously by now if I get the

[92.56s] club face closed to my target line in

[96.64s] the strike position so pointing left of

[99.52s] target for the right-hand golfer then

[101.68s] the ball is going to start left of

[104.64s] target. The ball will always start where

[107.92s] the club face is pointing at strike.

[111.119s] Now, delivering the club face back to

[113.2s] square at impact doesn't necessarily

[115.6s] mean that the ball is also going to fly

[117.68s] down your target line. So, we have to

[119.68s] talk about club path. If the club path

[122.88s] is from outside to in relative to your

[125.6s] target line, we're going to put right

[127.6s] spin on the ball and the ball's going to

[129.52s] move off your target line to the right

[131.84s] hand side. If the club path is from

[134.8s] inside to out relative to your target

[137.12s] line, the ball is going to curve off to

[139.92s] the left hand side with hook spin. So we

[142.8s] need to be able to control the club path

[145.52s] to be able to control the spin on the

[147.84s] ball. And the more you divert from club

[151.28s] face to club path, the more spin we

[153.84s] have. So really the goal of all these

[156.239s] easy wins is to deliver the club face

[158.72s] back to square and to try and minimize

[161.519s] the difference between the club path and

[164.16s] where the club face is pointing to

[166.239s] minimize the spin on the ball. Baby

[168.72s] fade,

[170.56s] baby draw, very controllable. So let's

[173.68s] get into these easy wins. Why do I call

[175.599s] them easy wins? Because it's minimum

[177.92s] disruption to the technique to get very

[180.959s] quick gains. Easy, easy, easy. Let's get

[184s] into it. Easy fix number one for the

[186.159s] right hand golfer left hand position.

[188.959s] This is the easiest fix if you're coming

[192.48s] in with the club face open. Ball is

[194.959s] starting right of target. Here is your

[196.959s] first pore of call. Here's how I teach

[198.879s] left hand grip grip position. Let the

[201.44s] hand hang and put the club in the left

[204.48s] hand. That's your natural position. So

[206.319s] you'll see that the arm doesn't hang

[208.239s] parallel to the body. It turns in a

[210.56s] little bit. If we just lay the club into

[213.2s] your hand in that natural position,

[215.68s] there's the position that the forearm

[217.44s] will want to return in natural. And

[220.08s] that's your square position at strike.

[222.239s] So, let's go strong position. If open

[224.56s] club face is a problem with you, we want

[226.4s] to go strong first. If you hit it too

[228.239s] far left, we can always work back from

[230.08s] there. So, here would be strong

[231.519s] position. Put your club outside your

[233.599s] left hip and then try again. Let your

[235.84s] hand hang naturally. Just put the club

[238.319s] into your hand there. So, we're going to

[240s] be in a stronger position. Much easier

[242.319s] to do this way rather than trying to

[244.879s] contort a position when the club's out

[246.799s] in front of you. So, there's strong

[248.56s] position. That's probably going to

[250.56s] create an over rotation of the left

[252.959s] forearm and rather close the club face.

[255.519s] Again, if you're coming in with open

[256.799s] club face, we want to try and do the

[258.639s] opposite. So, strong left hand position.

[260.799s] Often the problem I see of people trying

[262.32s] to get their grip position is when the

[264.16s] club's out in front of them in the

[266s] middle. And to get this strong position

[268.16s] is quite awkward. So they'll go into a

[270s] weak position. The arm's going to rotate

[272.24s] in the other direction, come into into

[274.32s] strike and open up the club face. So I'd

[277.12s] recommend to get a really good neutral

[279.52s] position. Left hand here. If you need a

[282.479s] stronger position, particularly if slice

[284.479s] ball starting right is your problem.

[286.32s] Start out here. And then we're going to

[288.08s] get that much more easy to square the

[290.16s] club face up. So I got trouble down the

[292s] right here, water. So I'm going to go

[295.12s] again. club it just out of left of my

[297.52s] left hip. So, I'm slightly strong. I'm

[300.479s] not going to change anything else from

[301.759s] there, but we pretty much avoid the ball

[304s] going at all right of target.

[308.56s] Yep. Left side of the fairway. Woo.

[313.28s] Okay. Easy win number two. Handle

[315.52s] position. Let's assume we've got the

[316.96s] club face returning back to square.

[319.039s] Should the handle of your driver be

[321.44s] rather up or down? Should it be rather

[325.12s] forwards, neutral or backwards? All

[327.84s] these have an influence on the path of

[330.56s] the swing and therefore the spin on the

[332.639s] ball. So, let me deal with the up down

[334.32s] first of all. So, the higher I go with

[336.72s] the handle, the more we're encouraging a

[339.919s] bias that's going to swing the club path

[342.32s] from inside to out, putting left spin on

[345.52s] the ball. And the lower I go with the

[348.24s] handle, the more I'm encouraging a club

[350.88s] path that's going to be from outside to

[353.039s] in. Therefore, putting right side spin

[356.479s] on the ball. So again, for the slice

[359.52s] tendency here would be your sort of

[361.68s] neutral position. If slice is still a

[364.72s] problem with that left hand grip

[366.56s] stronger, we'd rather go to a slightly

[368.88s] higher position with the hands sort of

[371.759s] Bryson Dejambo style. So, we're going to

[373.84s] swing more naturally from inside to out

[376.56s] with the club path rather than going low

[380.24s] with the hands where we're liable to

[382.16s] swing from outside to in with the club

[384.88s] path. All right. So, let's deal with the

[386.8s] horizontal position of the handle or

[389.12s] grip. If we let the driver lie on the

[391.84s] ground how it's made, if it's made well,

[395.12s] the shaft will probably sit at 90° to

[397.68s] the ground and we don't really want to

[399.44s] change it from there. So I would

[401.199s] discourage moving the handle forwards.

[403.199s] Again, that would rather get draw spin

[405.28s] on the ball. If we do that with your

[407.199s] irons, hands forward, we're encouraging

[409.52s] that into outstroke. The problem with

[411.84s] the driver, obviously, I've got 10 1/2°

[414.319s] here. I'm going to turn it down to 0

[416.4s] degrees. If I push my hands forward, so

[418.96s] not a good idea with the driver to push

[420.96s] the hands forward. So I'd rather have it

[423.44s] in neutral position. The position really

[425.919s] to avoid horizontally, particularly for

[428.319s] the slicers, is hands back. Again, with

[431.68s] the hands back behind the club head,

[434.319s] we're encouraging an out to in swing

[437.36s] path, club path. And so bias will be to

[440.8s] put right spin on the ball and make it

[444s] really worse for your slice. So the

[445.68s] slices out there so far, we've got a

[448.4s] weak left hand grip position. We'd have

[450.96s] a handle position that's low and back

[454.08s] and then you're just going to hit it

[455.52s] right, right, right all day. So, let me

[457.759s] show you one I'm going to try and set up

[459.199s] for a draw spin. Let me get rid of that

[460.88s] ball.

[462.96s] So, draw spin. I would rather go today

[465.84s] with the two easy wins. I'd rather go

[468.96s] slightly strong grip position.

[472s] Okay, we got that. We go rather a

[474.72s] position with the hands neutral to the

[477.68s] club face. So, not behind. So, making

[479.68s] sure my hands are up level with the club

[481.84s] and I'd be rather in a dash shambo

[484.16s] position, suddenly high with the hands

[486.56s] rather than lower. So, let's just see if

[488.24s] we can draw this one. Might even hook it

[490.319s] a little bit because I tend to draw the

[491.52s] ball anyway. Let's have a go.

[496.4s] Just started a little bit left of target

[499.12s] and moved a little bit further left, but

[501.199s] it's still a fairway finder. So

[503.039s] hopefully you understand now with those

[504.639s] two easy wins how we can start to

[507.52s] influence where the ball starts and how

[510.16s] it spins afterwards. If you're a little

[512.88s] bit lost with your swing, confused of

[514.719s] which direction to go, check me out at

[516.88s] Buy Me a Coffee. I have 25 spots

[519.68s] available for video exchange coaching

[522s] using the OnF form app to get you back

[524.56s] on track and realizing your potential.

[528s] Okay, easy win number three, forearm

[530.24s] alignment. And I'm going to show try to

[531.68s] attempt to show you this with my

[533.519s] alignment stick. If anybody ever wants

[535.92s] to volunteer to help me with my videos

[538.24s] out in the beautiful Black Forest in

[539.839s] Germany, great. You can help me with all

[541.839s] these bits and pieces. Right. So,

[543.519s] forearm alignment here would be my

[545.76s] neutral. So, obviously shoulders

[547.839s] pointing towards the target, feet, hips,

[549.92s] but also forearms. If I get my right

[552.959s] forearm below my left forearm, I'm

[556.16s] encouraging an in to out swing path. So

[559.44s] draw spin, left spin on the ball. If I

[562s] get my right forearm higher than my left

[564.8s] forearm forearm, I'm doing the opposite.

[567.12s] I'm encouraging outside to in swing

[569.68s] path. So cut spin on the ball. Often we

[572.32s] see sort of married with that is the

[574.48s] body position too far forward. So we

[576.88s] also want to get the forearms aimed or

[579.76s] if you're trying to influence spin on

[581.839s] the ball rather draw spin, fade spin. So

[586.24s] let me just extricate myself.

[589.36s] from my alignment stick here. I'll try

[592s] and hit a little baby draw for you down

[594.08s] the eighth hole here. So, I'm going to

[596.16s] go neutral with my grip position and I'm

[599.12s] going to go neutral with my handle

[601.839s] position and we're just going to go

[604s] right forearm underneath the left

[606.24s] forearm. So, we're encouraging again

[608.64s] inside to out and a little baby draw.

[611.2s] Here we go.

[614.24s] Yes, there he is. Absolutely

[617.6s] beautiful. Right. So, how do we put all

[620.24s] that into play? So, it depends if you're

[622.079s] a slicer or a hooker or you just want to

[624.399s] fade the ball and draw the ball on call.

[627.519s] So, slicers, I would recommend the one,

[629.76s] two, three. We want to go stronger grip

[632.56s] position. We want to get the handle

[634.56s] rather up and definitely not back. And

[637.36s] we'd rather get the right forearm below

[639.92s] the left forearm. So, if I just aim on

[642.399s] that bunker, I'm playing to sort of hook

[644.56s] it back. So, no more slice.

[649.12s] Yep. Started just on the bunker and is

[651.6s] now moving well left on the fairway. If

[654.72s] hooking is your problem, you would also

[657.68s] then think about that in reverse. So,

[660.32s] you rather go neutral grip position to

[663.279s] weak grip position. Probably stay

[665.36s] neutral. We'd rather go handle slightly

[668.72s] low, but again, keeping it neutral to

[671.36s] keep the same loft on the club. And you

[673.6s] go rather right forearm above the left

[676.64s] forearm. So I got to aim it down the

[678.24s] left side now. So here we go. So

[681.839s] handle's going to be low. I'm in neutral

[684.88s] grip position. I got my right forearm

[687.519s] above my left forearm. Normal swing. Not

[690.56s] changing anything in the swing here.

[694.64s] Yep. Started just left side of the

[696.32s] fairway. Now he's coming back. It's

[698.16s] going to be just right side of the

[699.279s] fairway. So again, if you're trying to

[702.079s] fight a hook or trying to fight a slice,

[704.959s] you'll probably want to engage all three

[706.64s] of those. If you're just wanting to

[708.72s] control fade and control a little draw,

[712.56s] then you probably just want to employ

[714.32s] one of those. So if I'm just trying to

[716.24s] hit it just on the inside of the bunker

[718.24s] with a little bit of baby draw, I'm

[720.959s] probably going to go neutral grip

[722.56s] position. I'm probably going to go

[724.72s] neutral handle position. Or I could go

[726.959s] high. or I'm going to go right hand,

[729.68s] right forearm, sorry, under or keep it

[732.24s] neutral, but one of those two. So, if I

[734.88s] employ two of them, I'll probably get

[736.48s] more draw spin. If I only employ one of

[738.8s] them, I'll get less draw spin.

[740.32s] Hopefully, that makes sense. Let me just

[741.92s] finish off with a beautiful little baby

[743.68s] draw. Let's do a dashambo baby draw.

[746.48s] Hands high, encouraging that in to out

[750.32s] swing path. Nothing else in the swing

[752.24s] changes.

[755.12s] There he is. Started on the bunker,

[757.68s] little bit left.
