[5.2s] You know, coming out onto the golf

[6.56s] course early in the morning has some

[8.08s] huge advantages. Despite the noise of

[10.16s] the green keepers, we can do some

[11.84s] creative and to be honest, slightly

[13.92s] dangerous practices. No more so than

[17.279s] practicing the throwing motion, the

[19.52s] foundation of the golf swing, as so

[22.16s] beautifully described in his

[24.08s] breakthrough book, Fred Shoemaker&#39;s

[26.4s] Extraordinary Golf.

[29.92s] Woohoo!

[34s] The magic lies in allowing the body to

[36.8s] instinctively create the speed and the

[39.2s] club head to propel it forwards.

[43.76s] Beautiful. And within this throwing

[46s] motion lie the secrets to back swing and

[48.96s] transition for more power, which may

[51.6s] actually shorten your swing rather than

[54.239s] lengthen it. So, in this video, I&#39;m

[56.64s] going to show you there&#39;s method in the

[58.079s] madness and give you three simple tips

[61.359s] to help you power up and transition with

[64.879s] your driver to launch some rockets.

[69.68s] Oh yeah, I&#39;m Andrew Cullen. If you want

[72.32s] to swing better, think better, score

[75.04s] better, and golf yourself to life,

[77.92s] subscribe here.

[82.64s] So, if you do get to throw some clubs,

[84.72s] there is method in the madness. That&#39;s

[86.56s] how I start all my beginners is just to

[88.88s] try and imagine that you&#39;re going to

[90.32s] throw the club as far as you can. You&#39;ll

[92.72s] see some critical phases which I want to

[94.799s] bring into the tips here. Number one,

[96.72s] you would start with the club up in the

[98.479s] air. The club would drop down and then

[101.28s] it would swing at 90° to your upper body

[104.32s] position. So, the transfer of energy

[107.04s] through the body gets to the club head

[109.119s] most efficiently and powerfully. You

[111.759s] would never see anybody throwing the

[113.759s] club as far as they could, starting here

[117.04s] and then going this way. It just doesn&#39;t

[120.32s] work. So, baseball swings, we&#39;re going

[122.96s] high and then we&#39;re dropping low and

[125.52s] then we&#39;re swinging around the body. A

[128.479s] good pl tennis player trying to play a

[130.56s] forehand top spin to the leftand corner

[133.68s] would start with a racket up here, not

[135.44s] with the racket down here. We drop it

[137.68s] down and then we create power. Not just

[141.2s] through that hand and arm, but through

[143.04s] the body. You will also see that the

[145.599s] right side helps in the whole motion.

[148.879s] Again, when we&#39;re swinging back, ready

[150.72s] to throw, the right side is bracing

[153.12s] itself. It&#39;s stable, so it&#39;s able to

[155.519s] push forward onto the left side. This is

[158.8s] where the foundation of this powerful

[161.68s] three tips I&#39;m going to give you now is.

[163.519s] And hang around to the end. I&#39;ll show

[165.04s] you a bonus tip to make it even better.

[168s] So, let&#39;s start with tip number one.

[169.76s] What I call tee to the right pocket.

[172s] What the hell am I talking about? So, we

[174.48s] grab the grip end of your club. We stick

[176.319s] the tee in that end of the club. And

[178.56s] we&#39;re going to try and point this tee to

[181.12s] your right pocket for the righthander.

[182.959s] Sorry, lefties. Just think in reverse.

[184.879s] To the right pocket for as long as you

[186.48s] can. This is straight out of David Le

[188.8s] better a swing, which I thought was a

[190.56s] brilliant book. And this move does a lot

[193.68s] of things. For the purposes of what

[195.12s] we&#39;re doing today, you&#39;re going to see

[197.04s] how it makes the swing naturally upright

[200.08s] on the back swing to naturally flatter

[202.879s] on the way through just by focusing on

[205.36s] where the te&#39;s pointing. So, let me show

[207.2s] you in slow-mo first of all. So, normal

[209.84s] setup and then I&#39;m going to try and

[211.44s] think on the takeaway of getting this

[213.12s] tee to the right pocket and it&#39;s going

[215.599s] to stay pointing at the right pocket for

[217.599s] as long as I can. So you see how much

[220s] the chest, the whole uh rib cage has to

[222.64s] turn on the back swing. The beautiful

[224.56s] coordination between club, hands, arms

[228.159s] and body. Now at some point the right

[230.4s] shoulder is going to get closer to the

[231.84s] grip than the left shoulder. So the

[233.28s] right arm has to fold and as it folds

[235.28s] it&#39;ll rotate. So the tee starts to point

[238s] round to the ball and then stays

[240.64s] pointing at the ball as long as you can

[242.08s] on the way down. So you see the the the

[244.959s] method and the madness here from the

[247.12s] throw swing is if I go tee to the right

[249.68s] pocket, I&#39;m automatically getting this

[252.239s] upright swing. I&#39;m not trying to swing

[254.64s] it upright. I&#39;m just turning the whole

[256.799s] rib cage tea to the right pocket. And

[259.519s] then as we go through transition, the

[261.6s] beauty here and the reason that you

[263.44s] might feel that we need less back swing

[265.84s] is it makes the arm swing very compact.

[268.4s] I&#39;m very much attached upper arms to

[270.72s] upper body. As the arm folds, it&#39;s going

[273.199s] to fold late and more downwards. That

[275.919s] keeps the arm swing nice and compact.

[278.32s] And that flattening again helps with the

[280.56s] rotation of your arms and to help swing

[282.72s] the club from inside with power. So, you

[286.639s] might well feel it&#39;s a slightly shorter

[289.04s] arm swing swing, but we&#39;re not trying to

[292.08s] swing shorter. We&#39;re actually building a

[294.08s] way better coordination between the arm

[296.32s] swing and the body swing. Right, let&#39;s

[298.16s] put it into action. So, we do another

[300.479s] little slow practice swing. So, a right

[302.88s] tee to right pocket. Sorry, T right

[304.8s] pocket. Right pocket, right pocket

[306.72s] flips. And then we&#39;re going to come

[308.88s] beautifully from inside. All right, here

[310.56s] we go. Just to focusing on the tea to

[314s] get a natural throwing motion.

[319.36s] Oh,

[321.759s] beautiful little baby draw. I live my

[323.84s] life to see that flute ban that. Sorry,

[325.84s] that was a little bit German. That

[326.96s] trajectory

[328.479s] makes my day. So tip number two, right

[330.88s] foot flat. We saw in that throwing

[332.96s] motion that to be able to move

[335.52s] powerfully left, we need a very stable

[338.56s] right side. So the right foot&#39;s flat on

[340.72s] the floor and pushing towards the left

[343.36s] side before we go into rotation on and

[346.4s] release. If we didn&#39;t have stability in

[348.72s] that right foot, we were rolling to the

[350.88s] outside, it would be very difficult to

[353.12s] move powerfully forward. very common

[356.16s] mistake and something I correct almost

[358.479s] on a daily basis. So, we&#39;re just going

[360.88s] to try and keep the sole of the right

[362.4s] foot flat on the back swing. So, we can

[365.68s] push early and forwards or left really

[369.44s] for the right hand player as we go into

[371.919s] strike. Super powerful move. Why does

[374.08s] that make the back swing feel short?

[375.84s] Because you can&#39;t rotate as much. So, if

[378.88s] the right foot&#39;s flat on the floor,

[381.6s] that&#39;s as far personally as my pelvis

[383.759s] would go. Everybody&#39;s slightly

[385.28s] different. If the right foot was now to

[387.36s] roll,

[389.36s] pelvis goes further, shoulders go

[391.12s] further, arms go further, and we tend to

[393.36s] lose control, and we&#39;re losing torque.

[395.84s] We&#39;re trying to wind the body body up

[397.68s] like a spring here. So, we need to keep

[399.44s] that right foot flat on the floor. So,

[401.28s] let me show you a slow-mo. First of all,

[403.36s] right foot stays flat, flat, flat. Now,

[406.96s] it&#39;s easy to push forwards and left and

[409.759s] get rotating nice and early and

[412s] powerfully. All right, here we go. So,

[414.24s] right foot flat

[416.24s] on the back swing for a beautiful

[418.8s] foundation for the down swing.

[423.28s] Oh, yeah. There&#39;s that baby draw again.

[426.319s] If you&#39;re scrolling through YouTube and

[428.24s] not find any answers to your golfing

[430.08s] questions, consider checking me out at

[432.16s] Buy Me a Coffee while I&#39;ll give you

[434.639s] video answers to your personal questions

[437.52s] to get you sorted out and improving fast

[440.24s] on the golf course. All right, tip

[442.08s] number three. Something I learned from

[443.759s] Jeanjac Reves, David Leb better&#39;s mate

[446.479s] who co-wrote the A swing and it was to

[448.96s] keep your lower right leg in concrete.

[452.24s] So there&#39;s no movement lower right leg.

[455.44s] The as you turn well with the upper

[457.36s] body, the pelvis will get turned back.

[459.84s] The upper thigh will definitely get

[461.919s] pulled back behind you. But we need to

[464.08s] put again the restrictors on. So we&#39;ve

[466.319s] got flat foot and now we&#39;ve got lower

[468.56s] right leg in concrete. We&#39;re torquing up

[470.88s] to make a very powerful movement on the

[473.84s] down swing. So you really want to sort

[475.599s] of imagine that you&#39;re up to here in

[477.599s] concrete on the back swing and then we

[479.759s] can really power through the shot with a

[482.4s] beautiful body turn on the way down. So

[484.24s] here we go. Last one. Right foot&#39;s going

[485.68s] to stay stable. Right lower leg in

[489.199s] concrete on the back swing.

[494.479s] And there&#39;s the third one. Beautiful

[496.639s] baby draw. Thanks for sticking around.

[498.8s] Here&#39;s your bonus tip to again get the

[500.72s] feeling of the limit of your back swing,

[503.52s] making it a really powerful torqued up

[505.84s] back swing. You need your head and you

[508s] need a wall. You know, I&#39;m not a lover

[509.68s] of training aids. You got to buy pieces

[512.399s] of plastic off Amazon or wherever. We

[515.279s] can do all these things on the driving

[516.479s] range. Just have to be a little

[517.519s] creative. All right. You got your head,

[519.2s] you got your wall. You take your setup

[520.8s] without the club. I&#39;m basically very

[522.959s] close to the wall here. And we&#39;re just

[524.64s] going to try and make a full turn. Maybe

[526.48s] think of that tee to the right pocket as

[528.32s] you go back. You won&#39;t see this because

[530.56s] there&#39;s a wall in the way. So, think of

[532.48s] that tea to the right pocket. And then

[534.48s] you&#39;ll really feel that the body is

[536.48s] torquing up on the back swing. You&#39;re

[538.64s] going to have restrictions from the

[540.16s] right foot. You&#39;re going to have

[541.279s] restrictions from the right lower leg.

[543.36s] You&#39;re going to be arm swing very

[545.12s] compact with the tea going to the right

[546.959s] pocket. And if we keep the head from

[549.12s] swaying off to the right hand side,

[551.36s] you&#39;re going to torque up even more on

[553.44s] the back swing to powerfully move on the

[556.56s] down swing.

[559.839s] Kaboom. All right, now we&#39;re hitting

[562.16s] powerful fairway finders. You maybe want

[564.32s] to sort your chipping
