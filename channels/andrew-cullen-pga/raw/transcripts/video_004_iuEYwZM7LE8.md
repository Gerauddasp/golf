[0.00s - 3.44s]
All right, drill number two, what I'll

[1.28s - 5.44s]
call the stomp drill. And really, really

[3.44s - 7.52s]
effective drill to stop you hanging back

[5.44s - 8.96s]
on the ball. Lots of amateur golfers

[7.52s - 10.96s]
have the sort of feeling, especially

[8.96s - 12.40s]
with the longer irons, that we somehow

[10.96s - 14.48s]
got to get the ball up in the air.

[12.40s - 16.08s]
Disaster. We're getting the horizontal

[14.48s - 17.84s]
low point further and further and

[16.08s - 20.16s]
further behind the ball. So, here's what

[17.84s - 22.32s]
I call the stomp exercise to get you

[20.16s - 24.24s]
further forward and again get this

[22.32s - 26.00s]
descending blow on the ball. So, I'll

[24.24s - 27.28s]
show you in slow-mo first of all, and I

[26.00s - 29.28s]
would do it in slow-mo to start with

[27.28s - 31.20s]
just until you get the coordination. So,

[29.28s - 32.56s]
as we're just finishing the back swing,

[31.20s - 34.80s]
we're going to lift the left foot off

[32.56s - 36.40s]
the ground and stomp it back down again.

[34.80s - 38.32s]
And you'll see again what I was talking

[36.40s - 40.32s]
about stern and relative to the ball.

[38.32s - 43.20s]
We're obviously moving left. We're

[40.32s - 45.28s]
moving along the X-axis, bringing the

[43.20s - 46.88s]
low point further forward. So, I'll do a

[45.28s - 50.16s]
couple at full speed just practice

[46.88s - 52.64s]
swings. So, back swing

[50.16s - 55.44s]
stomp. Doesn't necessarily have to be a

[52.64s - 58.56s]
step forward. We're just trying to load

[55.44s - 60.32s]
the left side. and loading the left side

[58.56s - 64.40s]
brings the low point forward. So, okay,

[60.32s - 66.00s]
here we go. And lots of power creation

[64.40s - 68.08s]
in this move as well. Let me do one

[66.00s - 71.48s]
first, then we'll talk about the power

[68.08s - 73.28s]
that it gets.

[73.28s - 76.48s]
Okay, I'm so just I've just decided I'm

[75.28s - 78.16s]
going to hit lots of shots around the

[76.48s - 80.80s]
golf course next time with feet together

[78.16s - 84.40s]
and lots of stompers. All right, so we

[80.80s - 86.88s]
are getting some lateral force. We are

[84.40s - 89.92s]
getting some vertical force and we are

[86.88s - 92.00s]
getting rotational force all with one

[89.92s - 94.08s]
beautiful power move. So let me do one

[92.00s - 96.24s]
more for you here. Stomp drill. Just

[94.08s - 100.32s]
take a practice swing.

[96.24s - 102.88s]
Stomp. And the most important bit is the

[100.32s - 106.72s]
influence of the horizontal low point

[102.88s - 110.40s]
coming after the ball. Okay, here we go.

[106.72s - 114.40s]
The last stomper.

[110.40s - 114.40s]
Oh yeah. Muted.
