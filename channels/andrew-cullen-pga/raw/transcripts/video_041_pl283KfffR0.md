[0.24s] Padding tip number 26 of 100. Get

[3.44s] connected. To build a consistent stroke

[6.48s] and get maximum feedback from the

[8.96s] strike, we need to get your arms

[11.12s] connected to your body. The more the

[13.44s] hands go in this direction, the less

[15.68s] connected we are. The more the hands go

[17.68s] in this direction. And however you grip

[19.52s] the club, the more connected you are and

[21.84s] the less rotation you'll get in the club

[23.92s] face. So, personally, my left hand's

[25.92s] sitting a little underneath the grip,

[27.52s] right hand sitting a little underneath

[29.04s] the grip, and getting the thumbs

[30.72s] together. That gets me connection, gets

[33.28s] me great feedback in the strike

[35.12s] position. So, we got a nasty little left

[37.68s] to righter down the hill here. Great

[39.92s] connection, creates me great feedback in

[42.88s] the strike position. That's a little

[44.24s] strong, but it's a good line. Might

[45.60s] still go in the hole.

[47.52s] [Laughter]

[49.36s] Oh, it's a good day today. If I get

[51.36s] disconnected, so the hands going more on

[54.00s] top, I don't get the same feedback. The

[56.64s] arms are hanging a little bit too loose

[58.40s] from my body. Again, the hands are

[60.32s] facing more down to the left, down to

[62.80s] the right. So, I'm not getting

[64.08s] connected. I've not got the same

[66.08s] feedback, the same control of the club

[68.00s] face. It's more likely to waggle all

[69.84s] over the place. Wasn't such a bad putt,

[72.24s] but it's not maximum feedback. So,

[74.96s] again, get connected. It's much easier

[78.08s] to control the swing path. Much easier

[80.80s] to get great feedback and then much

[83.12s] easier to get their pace right, distance

[86.24s] right and keep the ball online. Not two

[88.32s] out of three surely. Oh, what a day. I'm
