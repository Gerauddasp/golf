**[0.08s - 5.84s]**
Putting tip number 24 of 100, nasty

**[3.92s - 7.76s]**
downhill putts. As we've said on a

**[5.84s - 9.36s]**
putting tip earlier in this series, we

**[7.76s - 10.8s]**
want to be positive. Look at the front

**[9.36s - 12.56s]**
of the ball. Make sure you're swinging

**[10.8s - 14.88s]**
through it, but we don't want the ball

**[12.56s - 17.6s]**
to come too hot off the putter head. So,

**[14.88s - 20.4s]**
let's hit it out of the toe and not the

**[17.6s - 21.84s]**
sweet spot to control the speed. So,

**[20.4s - 23.76s]**
little bit of right to left in this one.

**[21.84s - 26.24s]**
I'm going to address it out of the toe

**[23.76s - 27.92s]**
of the club. And I'm just going to set

**[26.24s - 29.12s]**
the wheels in motion. I'm looking at the

**[27.92s - 30.8s]**
front of the ball. So, I'm still making

**[29.12s - 32.72s]**
a positive stroke, but I'm just trying

**[30.8s - 37s]**
to get the ball sending off on the right

**[32.72s - 37s]**
path and at the right speed.

**[37.52s - 42.24s]**
And my lucky day is here. Thanks for
