**[00:01.68 - 00:07.84]**
A nosy bob. If bad iron shots are ruining your score. Oh, thin as my

**[00:05.04 - 00:10.80]**
granny. Strikes all over the club face.

**[00:07.84 - 00:13.92]**
&gt;&gt; A chunky monkey. Coming up short of

**[00:10.80 - 00:16.64]**
target. Oh, and a loosey locket.

**[00:13.92 - 00:18.80]**
&gt;&gt; Then this video is going to change all

**[00:16.64 - 00:21.04]**
that. So, I'm going to give you four

**[00:18.80 - 00:22.80]**
powerful drills that I've used

**[00:21.04 - 00:25.60]**
throughout my 37year coaching career to

**[00:22.80 - 00:27.76]**
all handicap levels that I know will

**[00:25.60 - 00:30.56]**
give you instantly more consistency of

**[00:27.76 - 00:33.68]**
strike and more distance. If you want to

**[00:30.56 - 00:36.16]**
swing better, think better, score

**[00:33.68 - 00:39.28]**
better, and golf yourself to life,

**[00:36.16 - 00:43.92]**
subscribe here.

**[00:39.28 - 00:45.60]**
To strike the ball consistently, we

**[00:43.92 - 00:47.68]**
first need to understand the basic

**[00:45.60 - 00:50.56]**
physics of great ball strike. To hit the

**[00:47.68 - 00:52.48]**
ball in the sweet spot of the club,

**[00:50.56 - 00:54.56]**
first of all, we need to get the leading

**[00:52.48 - 00:57.36]**
edge somewhere underneath the equator of

**[00:54.56 - 00:59.20]**
the ball. So, we're going to hit the

**[00:57.36 - 01:02.64]**
sweet spot. That demands that the club

**[00:59.20 - 01:05.60]**
is traveling downwards to the ball. And

**[01:02.64 - 01:08.48]**
so, the low point in the club head swing

**[01:05.60 - 01:11.36]**
is going to be at the ball or slightly

**[01:08.48 - 01:13.04]**
beyond the ball. So, we get this

**[01:11.36 - 01:15.84]**
descending blow which helps us hit the

**[01:13.04 - 01:17.44]**
sweet spot, get the leading edge under

**[01:15.84 - 01:19.12]**
the equator of the ball and hit the

**[01:17.44 - 01:21.28]**
sweet spot. That's what we would call

**[01:19.12 - 01:24.40]**
the horizontal low point or the low

**[01:21.28 - 01:26.64]**
point on the x-axis. Obviously, if I get

**[01:24.40 - 01:28.40]**
the low point before the ball, we're

**[01:26.64 - 01:30.32]**
going to hit fats and thins. If we get

**[01:28.40 - 01:32.32]**
it at the ball, quite difficult to do,

**[01:30.32 - 01:33.76]**
but we're going to get exact strike.

**[01:32.32 - 01:35.76]**
Rather get a descending blow on the

**[01:33.76 - 01:37.84]**
ball. So, we have much more chance of

**[01:35.76 - 01:40.08]**
hitting the sweet spot. That is the

**[01:37.84 - 01:43.20]**
horizontal low point or x-axis of the

**[01:40.08 - 01:45.92]**
low point. But to get pure strike is not

**[01:43.20 - 01:48.00]**
just getting the horizontal low point in

**[01:45.92 - 01:49.84]**
the right place. We need to get the

**[01:48.00 - 01:51.76]**
vertical low point in the right place.

**[01:49.84 - 01:55.20]**
So there is also a yaxis. How high or

**[01:51.76 - 01:57.52]**
low is the club head coming into strike.

**[01:55.20 - 01:59.04]**
And there is also because we work in

**[01:57.52 - 02:02.64]**
three dimensions a z axis. How how far

**[01:59.04 - 02:04.72]**
away is the club head from my body?

**[02:02.64 - 02:07.36]**
closer or further away is also going to

**[02:04.72 - 02:09.20]**
affect whether we hit the sweet spot or

**[02:07.36 - 02:12.00]**
not. So, in these four powerful drills,

**[02:09.20 - 02:14.00]**
we're going to deal with two the most

**[02:12.00 - 02:16.48]**
common faults I see. Control of the

**[02:14.00 - 02:18.64]**
horizontal axis. We're going to have one

**[02:16.48 - 02:21.44]**
powerful drill for control of the Yaxis,

**[02:18.64 - 02:23.36]**
and we're going to have one very simple

**[02:21.44 - 02:26.32]**
drill for control of the Z axis to get

**[02:23.36 - 02:28.56]**
the physics right and get you puring the

**[02:26.32 - 02:30.56]**
ball out of the sweet spot. And stick

**[02:28.56 - 02:32.24]**
around to the end. I'll give you a

**[02:30.56 - 02:34.64]**
little bonus tip which is a great

**[02:32.24 - 02:36.48]**
feedback to get you instinctively

**[02:34.64 - 02:39.12]**
hitting the ball more pure. All right,

**[02:36.48 - 02:41.12]**
drill number one. Super simple, but

**[02:39.12 - 02:43.04]**
really the starting point for getting

**[02:41.12 - 02:46.00]**
control of your horizontal low point.

**[02:43.04 - 02:48.40]**
Again, getting the low point at or just

**[02:46.00 - 02:50.32]**
beyond the ball. We just make a few

**[02:48.40 - 02:51.92]**
swings with the feet together. We can

**[02:50.32 - 02:54.08]**
start off just without the ball first.

**[02:51.92 - 02:56.64]**
So obviously you can't move too much off

**[02:54.08 - 02:58.88]**
your central position to the ball

**[02:56.64 - 03:00.80]**
because you're going to fall over. If I

**[02:58.88 - 03:02.72]**
go too far right, then we're not be able

**[03:00.80 - 03:04.96]**
to keep our balance. So this is just a

**[03:02.72 - 03:07.36]**
very good trick to first of all, we'll

**[03:04.96 - 03:09.68]**
do this in two stages just to get the

**[03:07.36 - 03:11.68]**
feeling of being very central to the

**[03:09.68 - 03:14.64]**
ball. And you'll be surprised often how

**[03:11.68 - 03:16.32]**
good you will hit the ball from here

**[03:14.64 - 03:20.00]**
because we're not moving off center. We

**[03:16.32 - 03:21.52]**
should just play like that all the time.

**[03:20.00 - 03:23.36]**
And that's often the feedback I get from

**[03:21.52 - 03:26.00]**
my customers. We get beautiful pure ball

**[03:23.36 - 03:28.40]**
strike again because the horizontal low

**[03:26.00 - 03:29.92]**
point again pretty much opposite where

**[03:28.40 - 03:32.32]**
the sternum is. Your your low point will

**[03:29.92 - 03:35.60]**
be here to here. So sternum start of low

**[03:32.32 - 03:37.36]**
point under the left shoulder where the

**[03:35.60 - 03:39.52]**
deepest point of the divot will be. So

**[03:37.36 - 03:41.60]**
that just centralizes it. And what I

**[03:39.52 - 03:43.44]**
would recommend as sort of stage two

**[03:41.60 - 03:45.52]**
once you've done that a few times is

**[03:43.44 - 03:47.28]**
just get your speed up a little bit

**[03:45.52 - 03:49.52]**
because the body's so stable. we can

**[03:47.28 - 03:53.04]**
start to create some speed in the hands

**[03:49.52 - 03:55.92]**
and arms. And that means getting more

**[03:53.04 - 03:59.04]**
leverage and rotation, which as the

**[03:55.92 - 04:00.72]**
right arm straightens is going to give

**[03:59.04 - 04:02.40]**
you more speed. So, we can use this

**[04:00.72 - 04:05.68]**
drill not just for pure ball strike, but

**[04:02.40 - 04:08.00]**
also to get speed up without losing

**[04:05.68 - 04:10.16]**
control of your body. So, let's just hit

**[04:08.00 - 04:11.68]**
a couple more and get the speed up a

**[04:10.16 - 04:14.40]**
little bit.

**[04:11.68 - 04:16.32]**
Little bit thin, but lots of speed. You

**[04:14.40 - 04:17.60]**
might do that a little bit thin to start

**[04:16.32 - 04:19.28]**
with because you're maybe just hanging

**[04:17.60 - 04:21.20]**
on a bit tighter. Let's see if I can hit

**[04:19.28 - 04:23.12]**
one that's a little more relaxed. Here

**[04:21.20 - 04:26.36]**
we go.

**[04:23.12 - 04:29.76]**
Yeah, pured it. Beautiful. Feet

**[04:26.36 - 04:32.96]**
together. Get your speed up. All right.

**[04:29.76 - 04:34.24]**
Drill number two. What I'll call the

**[04:32.96 - 04:36.08]**
stomp drill. And really, really

**[04:34.24 - 04:38.08]**
effective drill to stop you hanging back

**[04:36.08 - 04:40.16]**
on the ball. Lots of amateur golfers

**[04:38.08 - 04:41.60]**
have the sort of feeling, especially

**[04:40.16 - 04:43.60]**
with the longer irons, that we somehow

**[04:41.60 - 04:45.04]**
got to get the ball up in the air.

**[04:43.60 - 04:47.12]**
Disaster. We're getting the horizontal

**[04:45.04 - 04:48.80]**
low point further and further and

**[04:47.12 - 04:50.48]**
further behind the ball. So, here's what

**[04:48.80 - 04:52.80]**
I call the stomp exercise to get you

**[04:50.48 - 04:54.96]**
further forward and again get this

**[04:52.80 - 04:56.88]**
descending blow on the ball. So, I'll

**[04:54.96 - 04:58.64]**
show you in slow-mo first of all, and I

**[04:56.88 - 05:00.00]**
would do it in slow-mo to start with

**[04:58.64 - 05:01.92]**
just until you get the coordination. So,

**[05:00.00 - 05:03.84]**
as we're just finishing the back swing,

**[05:01.92 - 05:05.28]**
we're going to lift the left foot off

**[05:03.84 - 05:07.44]**
the ground and stomp it back down again.

**[05:05.28 - 05:09.04]**
And you'll see again what I was talking

**[05:07.44 - 05:10.96]**
about stern and relative to the ball.

**[05:09.04 - 05:13.04]**
We're obviously moving left. We're

**[05:10.96 - 05:15.84]**
moving along the X-axis, bringing the

**[05:13.04 - 05:17.92]**
low point further forward. So, I'll do a

**[05:15.84 - 05:19.52]**
couple at full speed just to practice

**[05:17.92 - 05:22.72]**
swings. So, back swing,

**[05:19.52 - 05:25.28]**
stomp doesn't necessarily have to be a

**[05:22.72 - 05:28.16]**
step forward. We're just trying to load

**[05:25.28 - 05:31.20]**
the left side and loading the left side

**[05:28.16 - 05:32.96]**
brings the low point forward. So, okay,

**[05:31.20 - 05:37.04]**
here we go. And lots of power creation

**[05:32.96 - 05:38.64]**
in this move as well. Let me do one

**[05:37.04 - 05:40.72]**
first, then we'll talk about the power

**[05:38.64 - 05:43.76]**
that it gets.

**[05:40.72 - 05:48.00]**
Okay, I'm so just I've just decided I'm

**[05:43.76 - 05:49.12]**
going to hit lots of shots around the

**[05:48.00 - 05:50.80]**
golf course next time with feet together

**[05:49.12 - 05:53.44]**
and lots of stompers. All right, so we

**[05:50.80 - 05:56.96]**
are getting some lateral force. We are

**[05:53.44 - 05:59.52]**
getting some vertical force and we are

**[05:56.96 - 06:02.56]**
getting rotational force all with one

**[05:59.52 - 06:04.64]**
beautiful power move. So let me do one

**[06:02.56 - 06:06.80]**
more for you here. Stomp drill. Let's

**[06:04.64 - 06:08.88]**
take a practice swing

**[06:06.80 - 06:12.96]**
stomp. And the most important bit is the

**[06:08.88 - 06:15.52]**
influence of the horizontal low point

**[06:12.96 - 06:19.44]**
coming after the ball. Okay, here we go.

**[06:15.52 - 06:23.04]**
The last stomper.

**[06:19.44 - 06:26.88]**
Oh yeah, nutted. If you're scrolling

**[06:23.04 - 06:28.72]**
through YouTube and not finding the

**[06:26.88 - 06:30.32]**
answers to your golfing questions,

**[06:28.72 - 06:32.48]**
consider joining me at Buy Me a Coffee.

**[06:30.32 - 06:34.56]**
Well, I will personally answer as many

**[06:32.48 - 06:36.96]**
questions as you like in video format,

**[06:34.56 - 06:39.20]**
and you'll get access to a growing

**[06:36.96 - 06:41.52]**
library of the videos that I'm producing

**[06:39.20 - 06:43.60]**
to answer those questions for all my

**[06:41.52 - 06:46.72]**
customers, all for the tiny price of $10

**[06:43.60 - 06:48.64]**
a month.

**[06:46.72 - 06:50.24]**
Okay, so hopefully you've got a bit more

**[06:48.64 - 06:52.40]**
control of your x-axis, but not

**[06:50.24 - 06:55.52]**
necessarily a control of the yaxis up

**[06:52.40 - 06:57.76]**
and down. So the x-axis as we get

**[06:55.52 - 06:59.60]**
farther forward with the low point

**[06:57.76 - 07:01.20]**
definitely gives us the chance of

**[06:59.60 - 07:02.72]**
getting the leading edge underneath the

**[07:01.20 - 07:04.32]**
equator of the ball. But this could

**[07:02.72 - 07:06.08]**
still go wrong. So here's a brilliant

**[07:04.32 - 07:08.88]**
drill that solves I think the most

**[07:06.08 - 07:12.08]**
common problem I see is losing the

**[07:08.88 - 07:13.92]**
control of posture on the back swing is

**[07:12.08 - 07:15.60]**
what I call the tea drill. You may have

**[07:13.92 - 07:17.36]**
seen this on this channel a few times

**[07:15.60 - 07:20.24]**
before because it's one of the best for

**[07:17.36 - 07:22.24]**
a number of reasons and this reason for

**[07:20.24 - 07:23.60]**
controlling your posture. So, we're

**[07:22.24 - 07:25.52]**
going to point the tea towards your

**[07:23.60 - 07:27.44]**
right pocket for as long as possible.

**[07:25.52 - 07:29.12]**
Now, let me talk about the sense of that

**[07:27.44 - 07:31.36]**
as far as the Y-axis is concerned. What

**[07:29.12 - 07:34.64]**
I often see in poor swings is the club

**[07:31.36 - 07:36.64]**
starts a little bit flat back. The hands

**[07:34.64 - 07:38.80]**
go behind the shoulders. That has the

**[07:36.64 - 07:40.40]**
effect of bringing the left shoulder

**[07:38.80 - 07:43.20]**
quite high or a flat back swing and that

**[07:40.40 - 07:45.44]**
pulls yourself your posture out of

**[07:43.20 - 07:48.16]**
position both to the right and up. So,

**[07:45.44 - 07:49.52]**
here it is from the front. So, I'm going

**[07:48.16 - 07:51.76]**
to start too flat. usually too much with

**[07:49.52 - 07:53.44]**
the hands or wrists at the start. The

**[07:51.76 - 07:55.52]**
left shoulder will come high. I've got

**[07:53.44 - 07:57.28]**
nowhere for the left shoulder to go. My

**[07:55.52 - 07:58.64]**
head's in the way. So, it's just going

**[07:57.28 - 08:01.68]**
to pull my head up and right. We got big

**[07:58.64 - 08:04.16]**
vertical and horizontal axis problems

**[08:01.68 - 08:06.64]**
here. So, if we point the tee to the

**[08:04.16 - 08:09.12]**
right pocket for as long as we can on

**[08:06.64 - 08:11.44]**
the back swing,

**[08:09.12 - 08:14.80]**
take away halfway back and three

**[08:11.44 - 08:17.36]**
quarters, you'll see that I've got le

**[08:14.80 - 08:19.36]**
room for the left shoulder to come

**[08:17.36 - 08:22.00]**
underneath my chin and not knock me out

**[08:19.36 - 08:24.40]**
of my original posture position. So, let

**[08:22.00 - 08:26.08]**
me show you that again. T the right

**[08:24.40 - 08:28.56]**
pocket, right pocket, right pocket,

**[08:26.08 - 08:31.12]**
right pocket. And again, I'm keeping my

**[08:28.56 - 08:32.56]**
height. Let me show you quickly from the

**[08:31.12 - 08:35.76]**
front. So T to the right pocket, T to

**[08:32.56 - 08:37.52]**
the right pocket. Left shoulder is going

**[08:35.76 - 08:40.72]**
down, down, down. Much easier to control

**[08:37.52 - 08:43.44]**
my height on the back swing and control

**[08:40.72 - 08:46.32]**
the Y-axis of great ball strike. So here

**[08:43.44 - 08:48.72]**
we go. I'm just going to focus on T

**[08:46.32 - 08:50.48]**
pointing to the right pocket on the back

**[08:48.72 - 08:52.72]**
swing to get control of my posture on

**[08:50.48 - 08:55.20]**
the back swing and control the vertical

**[08:52.72 - 08:58.32]**
axis.

**[08:55.20 - 09:01.68]**
Yes, exactly. All right, drill number

**[08:58.32 - 09:04.08]**
four. To get more control of your Z

**[09:01.68 - 09:07.20]**
axis, how far the club is away from your

**[09:04.08 - 09:09.68]**
body, we use a head cover. You can use a

**[09:07.20 - 09:11.36]**
sponge, but you've always got one of

**[09:09.68 - 09:13.52]**
these uh in your bag. So, we place that

**[09:11.36 - 09:15.92]**
very close about a ball's width away

**[09:13.52 - 09:18.56]**
from the uh ball on the outside. So,

**[09:15.92 - 09:20.08]**
particularly if you use socket guys, and

**[09:18.56 - 09:21.60]**
I'm going to hit a fairly short shot

**[09:20.08 - 09:22.88]**
here because that's where most of the

**[09:21.60 - 09:24.24]**
sockets come. We'll talk more about that

**[09:22.88 - 09:26.24]**
in a minute. So, getting it out the the

**[09:24.24 - 09:27.76]**
socket of the club. Obviously, I'm going

**[09:26.24 - 09:29.76]**
to hit the head cover as well. So, we're

**[09:27.76 - 09:32.48]**
just trying to instinctively get your Z

**[09:29.76 - 09:35.68]**
axis control by putting something in the

**[09:32.48 - 09:38.64]**
way to try and miss and obviously hit

**[09:35.68 - 09:40.56]**
the sweet spot as we go past. Let me

**[09:38.64 - 09:42.32]**
show you. All right. So, the problem

**[09:40.56 - 09:44.16]**
with sort of half three/arter shots is

**[09:42.32 - 09:46.56]**
often the arms are very lively and the

**[09:44.16 - 09:48.72]**
body is very lazy. So, instead of

**[09:46.56 - 09:50.88]**
turning for these three quarter shots,

**[09:48.72 - 09:52.48]**
we're just using the arms. And often

**[09:50.88 - 09:54.16]**
then the left arm will come on top of

**[09:52.48 - 09:56.88]**
your rib cage, stay there, and now the

**[09:54.16 - 09:59.04]**
arm is closer to the ball. That means

**[09:56.88 - 10:01.28]**
the socket is closer to the ball. So, we

**[09:59.04 - 10:03.52]**
don't have control over our Z axis. So,

**[10:01.28 - 10:05.76]**
we're just just trying to hit the ball

**[10:03.52 - 10:07.76]**
and miss the head cover to get more

**[10:05.76 - 10:10.40]**
control of that left arm. All right,

**[10:07.76 - 10:12.64]**
here we go. So, 3/4 shot with the

**[10:10.40 - 10:15.60]**
pitching wedge.

**[10:12.64 - 10:17.92]**
Oh, beautiful. Thanks for sticking

**[10:15.60 - 10:19.36]**
around. Here's your bonus tip. You need

**[10:17.92 - 10:21.12]**
some of these boys face tapes or

**[10:19.36 - 10:22.96]**
sometimes I see people using foot spray.

**[10:21.12 - 10:24.96]**
Bit messy for me. But there we go. Let's

**[10:22.96 - 10:26.64]**
just get the face tape on because we

**[10:24.96 - 10:28.88]**
need to get feedback. You need to see

**[10:26.64 - 10:30.88]**
what your tendencies are and the face

**[10:28.88 - 10:32.88]**
tape doesn't lie. So, I'm just going to

**[10:30.88 - 10:34.48]**
hit a couple of shots here to finish up

**[10:32.88 - 10:36.72]**
and see if there is a tendency. Toe,

**[10:34.48 - 10:39.76]**
heel, high, low, and see which drill

**[10:36.72 - 10:42.88]**
would be helping me most and helping me

**[10:39.76 - 10:44.80]**
the quickest. All right, so here we go.

**[10:42.88 - 10:46.80]**
Just hit the first shot down there.

**[10:44.80 - 10:48.48]**
Hopefully, we find the middle of the

**[10:46.80 - 10:50.24]**
club face, but you never know. It can

**[10:48.48 - 10:52.08]**
change from day to day. All right, here

**[10:50.24 - 10:55.68]**
we go.

**[10:52.08 - 10:58.72]**
felt pretty good. It was a good shot.

**[10:55.68 - 11:01.36]**
Well, I say tendency middle of the club

**[10:58.72 - 11:04.24]**
face. Can't really argue with that. And

**[11:01.36 - 11:05.76]**
then usually the sweet spot on the on

**[11:04.24 - 11:07.84]**
the club face is sort of fourth or fifth

**[11:05.76 - 11:10.16]**
groove. You can get that by the sound of

**[11:07.84 - 11:12.00]**
just bouncing a ball on it. Slightly

**[11:10.16 - 11:13.36]**
different from manufacturer to

**[11:12.00 - 11:15.36]**
manufacturer and depending on the type

**[11:13.36 - 11:18.40]**
of club and the uh the space between the

**[11:15.36 - 11:20.00]**
grooves. But that's a pretty good start.

**[11:18.40 - 11:21.84]**
So, I'm just going to I would just do

**[11:20.00 - 11:24.56]**
all my drills to make sure I just really

**[11:21.84 - 11:26.80]**
fine-tune that. Finding the middle of

**[11:24.56 - 11:28.24]**
the club face. Let me do one more for

**[11:26.80 - 11:30.80]**
you. If we can repeat a middle club face

**[11:28.24 - 11:34.00]**
strike, then today is a happy day. All

**[11:30.80 - 11:37.72]**
right, here we go.

**[11:34.00 - 11:40.40]**
Yeah, also felt pretty good, flew pretty

**[11:37.72 - 11:43.68]**
good, and we've pretty much repeated

**[11:40.40 - 11:45.60]**
beautifully in the sweet spot. But we

**[11:43.68 - 11:48.24]**
need to get this feedback to see which

**[11:45.60 - 11:50.00]**
drill would should you should be

**[11:48.24 - 11:53.28]**
concentrating on X, Y or Zed. Many

**[11:50.00 - 11:55.04]**
thanks for watching. If driver is a

**[11:53.28 - 11:56.56]**
thing with you and we need to get some

**[11:55.04 - 12:00.80]**
improvement there, check out this
