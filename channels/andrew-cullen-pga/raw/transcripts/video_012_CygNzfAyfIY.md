[3.04s -> 10.72s] Is your practice swing often way better than your ball swing?

[10.72s -> 18.72s] It's something I see on a daily basis, both on the driving range and on the golf course. So, why is that? The

[18.72s -> 26.16s] problem is that the practice swing is one task. We're just trying to create speed in the club head, and the instinct

[26.16s -> 32.24s] does a pretty good job of that. And when we make the ball swing, it's three

[32.24s -> 40.44s] tasks. We've got to create speed in the club head. We got to strike the ball. And we got to send it in the right

[40.44s -> 46.48s] direction. Uh-oh. And with more complexity comes more

[46.48s -> 54.64s] stress and tension. So, even with great technique, a little more tension can cause a shortening of the muscles,

[54.64s -> 61.12s] creating top shots, or maybe getting your sequencing wrong to make it very difficult to get directional control.

[61.12s -> 70.16s] So, in this video, I'm going to give you three mental solutions to bring your practice swing into your ball swing for

[70.16s -> 74.96s] beautiful flowing shots to help you enjoy your golf more on the golf course.

[74.96s -> 84.52s] I'm Andrew Cullen. If you want to play better, think better, score better, and golf yourself to life, subscribe here.

[85.52s -> 94.64s] So, let's get you bringing your beautiful practice swing to your ball swing using one of or a combination of

[94.64s -> 100.56s] these three mental solutions I'm going to give you here. Solution number one,

[100.56s -> 107.12s] feel the club. Awareness of where the club is in space is critical to making

[107.12s -> 115.28s] good instinctive movement. So the big problem I see is what I call the blind spot here where lots of players lose

[115.28s -> 119.36s] awareness of where the club is in space. You'll see that from my client swing

[119.36s -> 125.6s] from earlier here. Beautiful practice swing upright to flat. So we flatten on the down swing. We come to what I call

[125.6s -> 131.52s] the beautiful angel angle. If you haven't seen my video on that, check this one here where we get a great

[131.52s -> 135.68s] coordination between body, hands, arms, and club. And then he goes to the ball

[135.68s -> 143.04s] swing and the club's in a completely different position in the transition and down into the ball. So just having

[143.04s -> 151.2s] awareness of where the club is in space can help enormously with your performance. Basically, the club as it

[151.2s -> 157.52s] swings back behind you, gravity wants to do that. So we need to allow the club to

[157.52s -> 163.76s] fall where it wants to fall. So if we feel where the club is in space in the practice swing. Yep. I feel that

[163.76s -> 168.96s] transition from back swing to down swing. And then I translate that into the ball swing

[168.96s -> 172.96s] flattening. That's right. Dynastic. Then we

[172.96s -> 181.2s] translate that beautiful practice swing into your ball swing. Feel where the club is in space. Solutions number two

[181.2s -> 188.8s] is what I call a Scotty Sheffler game face where we open the mouth very slightly from start to strike in the

[188.8s -> 194.72s] swing which has the effect not just of loosening the muscles in the cheeks and the face but also the shoulders the

[194.72s -> 200.64s] hands and the arms. So sequencing which I'll talk a bit bit more about in a minute is much easier. Let me show you

[200.64s -> 207.76s] one first with Scotty's game face and then we'll take it in a bit more detail. All right. So the mouth is very slightly

[207.76s -> 213.0s] open. start to strike. Boom. So, let's talk about sequencing.

[213.0s -> 221.28s] So, sequencing is basically based on throwing motion. Getting the

[221.28s -> 228.08s] coordination of body, arms, hands, and whatever you're throwing in the right order. So, if I was to try and throw

[228.08s -> 237.52s] this golf club as far onto the driving range as I could, I would probably make a little run up or a couple of steps,

[237.52s -> 241.44s] sort of Happy Gilmore style. And there's logic in Happy Gilmore. All right. So,

[241.44s -> 249.44s] we'd make a little bit of a runup. We'd plant the left foot down for the right-hand golfer. We'd push in the

[249.44s -> 256.48s] ground, which is going to create rotation in the hips and vertical force. And then we've got rotation and leverage

[256.48s -> 263.68s] in the body, hands, and arms behind it. And then we're going to relax and let go of whatever we're throwing. So that's

[263.68s -> 270.16s] the sequence of motion starting from the ground up through the hands and arms to the projectile that we're trying to get

[270.16s -> 276.48s] in the golf swing to maximize power. It also has a very big influence on

[276.48s -> 283.92s] directional control. So in slow-mo in the golf swing and obviously it's a more complicated throwing motion because

[283.92s -> 292.0s] we're trying to stay as stable to the ball as possible, but the sequencing is the same. So basically through

[292.0s -> 299.12s] transition I'm moving left same as a thrower would do. I'm pushing in the ground creating again rotational and

[299.12s -> 305.36s] vertical force that creates much more speed behind me with the upper body rotation leverage in the right arm and

[305.36s -> 311.76s] rotation in the right arm and then delivering the club head to the ball. That's the sequence we want. really

[311.76s -> 318.64s] complicated. But if we keep the upper body soft, hands soft, that sequencing

[318.64s -> 324.88s] takes place much more naturally. And that's the whole point of what you'll see in Scotty Shiffller swing. Mouth

[324.88s -> 331.12s] slightly open to try and relax the upper body so the sequencing is easier. So, let me hit a couple of shots for you.

[331.12s -> 338.48s] One, I'll just do full view and then we'll focus in on my face and show you my Scotty Sheffller game face. So, mouth

[338.48s -> 345.28s] slightly open. Here we go. So we get a beautiful sequence in the

[345.28s -> 352.32s] throwing motion. All right. So let's focus in on meller face. So again, mouth is just very slightly open. So no

[352.32s -> 359.32s] nothing of the teeth, no tension here. Relaxes the shoulders, hands, and arms.

[359.32s -> 364.4s] And then gets the sequencing much easier without having to think about it. So mouth open.

[364.4s -> 370.24s] Also helps to smile. I nailed it. If you're scrolling through YouTube and not

[370.24s -> 379.36s] finding the answers to your golfing questions, consider joining me at Buy Me a Coffee. Well, I will personally answer

[379.36s -> 386.88s] as many questions as you like in video format, and you'll get access to a growing library of the videos that I'm

[386.88s -> 393.76s] producing to answer those questions for all my customers, all for the tiny price of $10 a month.

[393.76s -> 401.76s] All right, solution number three to getting your practice swing to your ball swing. What I call look at the low

[401.76s -> 408.24s] point. Let's think of the logic here. The ball is lying on the ground. The only way we're going to get this ball up

[408.24s -> 413.68s] in the air is if the leading edge hits underneath the equator of the ball here.

[413.68s -> 422.4s] Then we hit the sweet spot. We've got some loft. The ball's going to fly. So, the low point in the club head swing

[422.4s -> 427.44s] needs to be at or just after the ball. So, we change the task by looking at the

[427.44s -> 435.12s] low point. We have a less stressful task. We're not trying to get the ball up in the air or send it straight or

[435.12s -> 441.2s] even hit it at all. We're just trying to hit the low point. So, if my

[441.2s -> 449.36s] subconscious really or my conscious is looking at the top of the ball, my subconscious is thinking right hit the

[449.36s -> 455.92s] top of the ball. There's actually quite a good chance full top that you are going to hit the

[455.92s -> 464.08s] top of the ball. So, this little practice I give you now, what I call hitting some small to get a few

[464.08s -> 473.44s] T's. You'll have seen this on my channel many times because it is the easiest way to get your practice swing to your ball

[473.44s -> 480.24s] swing. It's the most success I have with customers on the golf course. So, we just get a little tee. Let me just get

[480.24s -> 488.88s] you in view here. Just get a little tea, pop it in front of the ball, and you're looking at that point from start to

[488.88s -> 495.92s] strike. And sometimes just the anxiety and stress is a little bit away because all we have to do is make contact with a

[495.92s -> 503.52s] tee. We're not trying to direct the ball, get the ball up in the air. I'm just focusing looking at and focusing on

[503.52s -> 511.28s] the T t start to strike and the ball strike is just a consequence of trying to change

[511.28s -> 519.04s] the task and get the low point in the right place. So my recommendation here would be to use one of these on the golf

[519.04s -> 525.76s] course or you can use a combination number one and two. So awareness of the

[525.76s -> 534.56s] club with game face or two and three. So looking at a point in front of the ball with game face because this is a game

[534.56s -> 541.12s] changer keeping your mouth slightly open. So here's number one where I'm just keeping the mouth open. I'm

[541.12s -> 549.36s] focusing on where the club is from start to strike. So I instinctively create the right speed and direction in the club.

[549.36s -> 555.52s] So where's the club? Yep. Like that club. Almost feel the

[555.52s -> 563.52s] club sort of falling down at the start of the down swing. Or we just forget about where the club is. We keep the

[563.52s -> 571.12s] mouth open. We keep the eyes in front of the ball. And the only focus is just keeping the the eyes in front of the

[571.12s -> 577.12s] ball. Also, pick a piece of grass or on the mat. Just look at a piece of mat from start to strike.

[577.12s -> 583.6s] Again, just takes the anxiety away. Nailed that one. Takes a little bit of

[583.6s -> 590.32s] anxiety and stress away from actually trying to hit the ball or get the ball up in the air. All right. So, here's a

[590.32s -> 596.32s] little bonus tip for those hanging around because I know the comments going to come. The low point where the drivers

[596.32s -> 601.92s] in a different place. So, how do we deal with that? We look at a point on the ball, but I'm going to orientate the

[601.92s -> 607.6s] ball towards me and down. So, we're actually going to hit the ball at the start of the upswing. So, rather than

[607.6s -> 613.6s] focusing on a point ahead of the ball, I'm looking at a specific place on the ball with the same idea. So, here we go.

[613.6s -> 620.32s] We tee the ball up. Blue logo is just round the back there. So, again, I'm not too stressed about hitting the ball. I'm

[620.32s -> 628.96s] just focusing on the blue logo. Start to strike. Blue logo. Blue logo. Blue logo. Blue logo. Oh yeah. Beautiful little

[628.96s -> 631.92s] baby drawer.
