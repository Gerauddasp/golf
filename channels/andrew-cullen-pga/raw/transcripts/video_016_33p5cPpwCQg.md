**[0.00s - 4.32s]**
All right, step number one, finding your

**[2.40s - 6.64s]**
posture. Everybody's built differently,

**[4.32s - 8.72s]**
so we need to find a way to get you in

**[6.64s - 11.12s]**
your best postured position to make a

**[8.72s - 12.64s]**
beautiful athletic motion. Here's

**[11.12s - 15.60s]**
something taught to me by the brilliant

**[12.64s - 17.84s]**
Mike Adams, biomechanist extraordinaire.

**[15.60s - 19.84s]**
You don't have to change much from your

**[17.84s - 22.24s]**
normal upright posture. So, let me

**[19.84s - 24.32s]**
explain. If I'm standing straight up and

**[22.24s - 27.20s]**
down here, my head and spine are more or

**[24.32s - 29.20s]**
less in a line natural S form. My

**[27.20s - 30.96s]**
shoulders are wide and I have a slight

**[29.20s - 32.64s]**
knee flex. I don't stand with straight

**[30.96s - 34.56s]**
legs. It's not very comfortable. They're

**[32.64s - 37.60s]**
slightly bent. And we're trying to keep

**[34.56s - 39.92s]**
all these three positions, but orientate

**[37.60s - 42.00s]**
ourselves down towards the golf ball.

**[39.92s - 43.76s]**
So, the club head is getting thrown down

**[42.00s - 46.40s]**
towards the golf ball. So, here's the

**[43.76s - 49.12s]**
little uh test that we do. Uh, stand

**[46.40s - 52.08s]**
straight up, hands on the thighs, and we

**[49.12s - 54.16s]**
just sit back. Bend from the hip joint

**[52.08s - 56.32s]**
until the hands slide down on the

**[54.16s - 58.24s]**
longest finger touches the top of your

**[56.32s - 60.72s]**
kneecap. You'll get a bit of tension in

**[58.24s - 62.56s]**
your butt. Let the arms hang down.

**[60.72s - 65.68s]**
Bingo. That's the right distance from

**[62.56s - 67.68s]**
the ball, no matter what club I have in

**[65.68s - 69.92s]**
my hand. So, here would be pitching

**[67.68s - 72.32s]**
wedge and six arms. So pitching wedge,

**[69.92s - 74.80s]**
I'm definitely closer to the ball, but

**[72.32s - 77.20s]**
I've got the same posture position as I

**[74.80s - 80.32s]**
would with the sixiron. Okay, so

**[77.20s - 83.12s]**
pitching wedge, sixiron. And equally, if

**[80.32s - 85.60s]**
I put the driver suddenly in the hands.

**[83.12s - 88.56s]**
Okay, let's go. Again, standing straight

**[85.60s - 90.72s]**
up, slide down the longest finger, top

**[88.56s - 93.52s]**
of the kneecap.

**[90.72s - 96.56s]**
Posture position perfect, athletic, and

**[93.52s - 96.56s]**
ready to rumble.
