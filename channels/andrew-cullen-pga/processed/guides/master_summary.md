## 1. GRIP FUNDAMENTALS

### 1.1 Finding Your Natural Left Hand Grip Position

**The Core Principle:** Your natural arm rotation determines your optimal grip - not a textbook standard.

**How to Find Your Natural Grip** *(Videos 28, 29)*:
1. Stand straight up
2. Let both arms hang naturally at your sides
3. Observe how hands naturally turn inward (not parallel to body)
4. Place club on ground aimed at target
5. Wrap left hand fingers around club in this natural hanging position

**Result:** Your natural position could show anywhere from 2-4 knuckles visible

**Why This Matters:**
- **Biomechanics:** Where the left forearm starts is where it wants to return
- **Weak grip (unnatural for you):** Arm rotates clockwise through impact, opens clubface
- **Too strong grip (unnatural for you):** Arm over-rotates, closes clubface, ball starts left
- **Natural grip:** Arm returns naturally to starting position, delivers clubface square

**Professional Examples** *(Video 29)*:
- Matthew Fitzpatrick: Super strong grip (approx. 4 knuckles)
- Dustin Johnson: Super strong grip (approx. 4 knuckles)
- Bernhard Langer: Strong grip in his era
- Traditional teaching: 2 knuckles, V to right shoulder

### 1.2 Short Thumb vs. Long Thumb Position

**Neither is wrong - each serves specific purposes** *(Videos 27, 29)*

#### Short Thumb Position

**Recommended For:**
- Golfers who overswing
- Players with tendonitis, tennis elbow, or golfer's elbow
- Those seeking more control
- Anyone with club face control issues

**Advantages:**
- Better club support at top of backswing
- Weight distributed evenly across both arms
- Less pressure on left arm
- Much more control over swing
- Better directional control
- Greater wrist stability
- Prevents overswinging

**Andrew's Personal Choice:** Short thumb

**Referenced in:** Videos 27, 29

#### Long Thumb Position

**Recommended For:**
- Distance-focused players (ONLY when distance is significant problem)
- Players with adequate control but lacking power

**Advantages:**
- Increased leverage at top of swing
- Greater wrist angle
- More club head speed
- Additional distance potential

**Cautions:**
- Reduced wrist control
- Can open club face
- Less directional control
- Greater overswing risk
- Requires careful monitoring
- Andrew "rarely recommends" this

**Referenced in:** Videos 27, 29

---

### 1.3 Grip Pressure

**The 1-5 Scale System** *(Videos 26, 29)*:

**Level 1:** Almost as loose as possible (club might fly out)
**Level 3:** RECOMMENDED for most golfers
**Level 5:** Gripping as tight as possible (Bryson DeChambeau uses this)

**Standard Recommendation - Pressure Level 3:**
- Allows natural rotation and leverage from both arms
- Enables proper arm sequencing through strike
- Facilitates better clubface control
- Maintain from start through impact

**The Chain Reaction:**
1. Controlled grip pressure (Level 3)
2. → Better arm rotation
3. → Improved clubface control
4. → More fairways and greens hit

**Advanced Technique - Different Pressure Each Hand** *(Video 29)*:

**Andrew's Personal Method: Left Hand 4, Right Hand 2**

**Benefits:**
- Prevents right hand from hitting too hard
- Allows better release
- Creates more powerful position at strike
- More leverage and compression
- Prevents early release from right hand

**Example:** Shane Lowry's little finger isn't even on grip during swing

**Referenced in:** Videos 26, 29

---

### 1.4 The "Lobster Grip" Mistake

**What It Is** *(Videos 1, 33, 34)*:
- Gripping too tightly with INDEX FINGER and THUMB of right hand
- Andrew calls this "lobster fingers" or "the lobster"

**The Problem:**
Even with great setup and rotation, the "lobster" causes:
- Throwing club from outside
- Loss of proper "angel angle"
- Chunks, slices, and pulls
- Early release
- Swing path moves LEFT at strike

**The Solution - "Switch the Lobster Off":**
1. Set up in normal address position
2. Open/release index finger and thumb of right hand
3. Make practice swings through transition
4. Without ability to push with those fingers, club naturally:
   - Folds down into proper "angel angle"
   - Right elbow folds to level with or below left arm
   - Creates proper delivery position

**Benefits:**
- Proper club position at transition
- Better elbow position
- Increased lag and leverage
- Improved delivery position
- Stops early throwing motion
- Preserves rotation space
- Creates LAG (speed element)
- Encourages right-side swing path

**Keep Right Hand:**
- RELAXED (especially index finger and thumb)
- SOFTER than left hand
- Experiment with how soft you can keep it

**Referenced in:** Videos 1, 8, 33, 34

## 2. SETUP & POSTURE

### 2.1 Finding Your Ideal Posture

**The Mike Adams Method** *(Videos 2, 16, 18)*

**Core Principle:** You don't need to dramatically change your natural upright posture

**The Setup Test:**
1. Stand straight up with good posture
2. Place hands on your thighs
3. Sit back and bend from the hip joint
4. Slide hands down until longest finger touches TOP of kneecap (not middle)
5. Feel tension in glutes/posterior chain
6. Let arms hang down naturally

**Key Points:**
- Head and spine remain in natural S-curve alignment
- Shoulders stay wide
- Maintain slight knee flex (not locked legs)
- Same posture position for ALL clubs (wedge, iron, driver)
- Club length determines distance from ball, not posture change

**Demonstrations:**
- Pitching wedge: Closer to ball, same posture
- 6-iron: Further from ball, same posture
- Driver: Even further from ball, same posture

**Referenced in:** Videos 2, 16, 18

---

### 2.2 Three Reference Points to Check Distance from Ball

#### Reference Point #1: Longest Finger Position *(Video 18)*

- Longest finger should touch TOP of kneecap (not middle)
- **Too low (middle of kneecap):** Difficult to turn
- **Too upright (above kneecap):** Hard to get club to ball naturally, overuse hands/arms
- **Just right (top of kneecap):** Optimal athletic position

#### Reference Point #2: Coin Test (For Irons) *(Video 18)*

- Use a coin (any denomination)
- Proper setup: Coin slides about 1/3 of way under club head
- The toe of club should be slightly off ground
- **Too upright:** Club lies flat on ground
- **Too low:** Coin slides halfway along club head
- **Note:** Difficult to apply for hybrids and woods

#### Reference Point #3: Right Hand Check (Butch Harmon Tip) *(Video 18)*

- Take right hand off grip after setup
- Hand should hang naturally opposite the grip
- **Too far away:** Hand hangs away from grip
- **Too close:** Hand hangs inside of grip
- **Just right:** Hand hangs opposite the grip

**Referenced in:** Video 18

---

### 2.3 Balance Point & Weight Distribution

**The Critical Third Element** *(Videos 14, 18)*

**Core Concept:** Balance point refers to where pressure is distributed under your feet

**Even with perfect posture, poor balance will cause:**
- Compensatory body movements
- Changed distance from ball during swing
- Inconsistent contact

#### Weight Too Far Forward (In Toes):

**Problem:** Body stands up during swing
**Result:** Different distance from ball at impact
**Consequence:** Difficult to hit cleanly

#### Weight Too Far Back (In Heels):

**Problem:** Body moves forward during swing
**Result:** Getting closer to ball
**Consequence:** Risk of chunking shots

#### Proper Balance:

- Feel pressure underneath BALLS of your feet
- Pressure under front of your shoelaces
- Allows body to remain stable throughout swing
- No need to react to maintain balance

**The Body's Natural Response:**
- **Key Principle:** "The body never wants to fall over"
- Any imbalance triggers automatic compensatory movements
- These are involuntary and difficult to control consciously
- Prevention (proper setup) is easier than correction (mid-swing)

**Referenced in:** Videos 14, 18

---

### 2.4 Center of Gravity Control

**The Belt Buckle Reference Point** *(Videos 14, 18)*

- Think of point BEHIND your belt buckle
- This represents your center of mass/center of gravity
- Keep this point as stable as possible from start to impact

**The Primitivo Wine Glass Visualization** *(Video 14)*:
- Imagine a glass of beautiful primitivo wine in middle of stomach
- Try not to spill a drop as you swing
- Makes abstract concept concrete and relatable
- Provides simple focus point during practice

**Why This Matters:**
- Stable center of gravity maintains consistent distance to ball
- The more stable this point, the better chances of solid contact
- Creates reliable foundation for entire swing motion

**Referenced in:** Videos 14, 18

---

### 2.5 Foot Position (Foot Flare)

**The Biomechanics** *(Video 2)*:

Different foot positions affect pelvis rotation:

1. **Both feet straight forward:** Restricts pelvis motion both directions
2. **Right foot open:** More backswing rotation, restricts follow-through
3. **Hogan setup (right forward, left open):** Restricts backswing, enhances follow-through
4. **Daffy Duck Principle:** "The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away"

#### Finding YOUR Perfect Foot Flare

**The Jump Test (Mike Adams Method):**
1. Take a jump forward
2. Notice how your feet naturally land
3. This landing position shows how your feet want to be positioned for maximum pelvis rotation in both directions

**Andrew's Personal Example:**
- Right foot turns out significantly (due to limited right hip mobility)
- Optimal position: "two or three minutes to one" on clock face
- Left foot: very slightly turned out
- Right foot: turned out more to accommodate hip restriction

**General Recommendations:**
- **For most golfers with limited mobility:** Right foot needs to be slightly turned out
  - Provides more rotation and radius
  - Creates speed and power
  - Allows space to swing from inside on downswing
- **Maximum flare:** Don't exceed approximately 15 degrees from straight forward
- **Right foot pointing forward (no flare):**
  - Only suitable if you have excellent hip mobility
  - For most, this restricts backswing and forces compensations
  - Makes it virtually impossible to swing from inside
- **Hogan/Woods setup:**
  - Appropriate only with no mobility/stability issues on backswing
  - Tiger Woods used this for maximum power shots
  - Prioritizes follow-through over backswing rotation

**Referenced in:** Video 2

---

### 2.6 Knee Position (Knee Flex)

**The Dangers of Incorrect Knee Flex** *(Video 2)*:

#### Too Straight (Locked Knees):
- Denies access to pelvis rotation both directions
- Risk of lower back pain
- Stretches hamstrings excessively (not good for lumbar spine)

#### Too Deep (Knees Over Toes) - MOST COMMON PROBLEM:
- Also denies access to rotation
- Creates compensations: arm swing, upper body swing, standing up
- Body must compensate by:
  - Standing up to access rotation
  - Overcompensating with arm swing
  - Over-rotating from back (pelvis not coming along)
- Lumbar spine tries to rotate more than it should

**Finding Your Perfect Knee Flex:**

1. Stand straight up and down
   - Notice knees already in slightly flexed position (natural comfort)
   - Legs are not locked out
2. Bend from your hip joint to address ball
   - Keep same knee flex from standing position
   - Maintain weight under shoelaces
   - Don't change relationship of lower leg to ground (~90° to ground)
3. Adjust only if necessary
   - If hamstrings tight/short and position uncomfortable
   - Add just a little more knee flex to relieve hamstring strain
   - **Keep knee flex to minimum** for full access to rotation

**Andrew's Personal Approach:**
- From standing straight, bends back
- Knees go slightly forward to relieve tight hamstring strain
- Not so much that it denies access to pelvis rotation
- "Standing straight, hips back" is natural position to aim for

**Referenced in:** Video 2

---

### 2.7 Ball Position

**For Full Shots** *(Video 22)*:

**Recommended Position:** Middle of stance (opposite center point between feet)

**The Low Point Principle:**
- Low point of club head swing should occur AT the ball or just after
- Goal: Get leading edge underneath ball's equator
- Sweet spot contact typically at 3rd, 4th, or 5th groove

**Ball Position Too Far Back (Towards Right Foot):**
- Club approaches on steeper angle
- Less surface area of ball accessible
- Very difficult to get leading edge under ball's equator
- While not impossible, much more difficult for clean contact

**Ball Position Too Far Forward:**
- Ball positioned beyond low point of swing arc
- Two poor outcomes:
  1. **Fat shots:** Chopping into ground before ball
  2. **Thin shots:** Hitting ball on upswing after low point

**For Putting** *(Video 50)*:

**Position Relative to STERNUM, not feet:**
- Goal: Hit ball just past low point, with club slightly ascending
- Low point always opposite the sternum
- Position: Ball underneath LEFT eye (for right-handed players)

**Check Method:**
1. Put second ball in left pocket
2. Set up to first ball normally
3. Drop second ball from left eye
4. Should land on top of first ball

**Result:** No backspin, clean roll without jumping

**Referenced in:** Videos 22, 50

## 3. DRIVER - ELIMINATING SLICES & ADDING DISTANCE

### 3.1 Understanding Ball Flight Physics

**Three Types of Slices** *(Video 1)*:

#### Straight Shot (Reference):
- Club face and club path pointing exactly same direction
- Ball starts straight and stays straight
- No spin on ball

#### Slice Type 1: Ball Starts Left, Then Slices Right
- Club face pointing left of target
- Swing path even MORE left than club face
- Creates right spin

#### Slice Type 2: Ball Starts Straight, Then Slices Right
- Club face pointing down target line at strike
- Club path to left of where club face pointing
- Ball starts straight, moves right

#### Slice Type 3: "Disaster Slice" - Ball Starts Right, Slices Further Right
- Club face pointing right of target line at strike
- Path still to left of where club face pointing
- Ball starts right, curves even more right

**KEY CONCEPT:** In all cases, narrowing angle between club face and club path reduces slice spin

**Referenced in:** Videos 1, 3

---

### 3.2 Six Solutions to Eliminate Driver Slice

All solutions work toward same goal: narrowing gap between club face angle and club path direction *(Video 1)*

#### Solution 1: Left Hand Grip Position (SETUP)

**Finding Your Natural Grip:**
1. Let left arm hang naturally at side
2. Place club into left hand while arm hanging
3. Natural position gives best chance of returning club face square

**If Club Face Still Open (Stronger Grip Method):**
1. Use "Adam Scott style" approach
2. Position club OUTSIDE your left hip
3. Make grip from this position
4. Keep arm hanging naturally
5. Creates stronger left arm rotation
6. Delivers club face closed or square to target line

**What to Avoid:**
- WEAK grip - causes counter-rotation of left arm, opens club face
- Leads to "disaster slice" (Type 3)

#### Solution 2: Handle Position at Setup (SETUP)

**The Problem:**
- Handle position behind club head and LOW encourages swing path to LEFT
- Creates slice spin

**The Fix:**
1. Position handle LEVEL with club head (not behind, not ahead)
2. Don't get handle ahead with driver - removes loft from face
3. Keep hands in neutral or HIGH position
4. Encourages opposite swing path (to right)
5. Promotes draw spin instead of slice spin

#### Solution 3: Backswing Rotation (SWING)

**Andrew calls this NUMBER ONE swing problem with slicers**

**The Problem:**
- Golfers get good grip and setup
- Then swing with only shoulders and arms on backswing
- Don't create space to swing club path to right
- Almost always swing club path off to left
- Creates slice spin

**The Solution: "Rib Stretch Thought"**

The One-Thought Move:
1. Pick a rib on RIGHT side
2. On backswing, stretch this rib as FAR AWAY from ball as possible
3. Keep arms passive - let them swing WITH body rotation

**Multiple Benefits:**
- Automatically creates proper upper torso rotation
- Pulls pelvis into proper turn (don't need to think about it)
- Pulls weight shift to right (don't need to think about it)
- Creates SPACE needed to swing path to right
- Enables draw spin on ball

#### Solution 4: No "Lobster Fingers" - Relax Right Hand (SWING)

*(See detailed section 1.4 - The "Lobster Grip" Mistake)*

**Key Principle:** Soft right hand = maintained rotation space = right-side swing path = draw spin

#### Solution 5: Proper Sequencing (SWING)

**The Problem:**
- Trying to TURN too early from top of backswing
- Throws right shoulder forward
- Gets club path moving left
- Causes slice

**Understanding Sequencing Through Javelin Throw Analogy:**

**Throwing Motion Sequence:**
1. Run up
2. Plant weight onto left side
3. Push into ground (creates rotation and vertical force)
4. Upper body rotation follows
5. Arm releases last

**Golf Swing Has SAME Sequence:**
1. From top of backswing: move LEFT (weight shift)
2. Push into ground (vertical force and rotation)
3. Behind all that: shoulders rotate
4. Finally: hands, arms, and club release

**How To Apply It:**

**Option 1: Right Shoulder Thought**
- Keep right shoulder BEHIND you in transition
- Don't let right shoulder come in FRONT of you

**Option 2: Left Arm Thought (Justin Rose Tip)**
- Keep left arm BEHIND your shoulder level as you swing down
- Don't let it get in front

**Result:** Both thoughts change club path to swing to RIGHT, converting slice to draw

#### Solution 6: Posture Control - Avoid Early Extension (SWING)

**The Problem (Particularly common with better players):**
- "Early extension" - losing posture before coming into strike
- Pelvis moving CLOSER to ball
- Even swing that looks good from inside...
- Pelvis moves forward and swing path moves LEFT
- Creates slice spin

**The Solution:**

**Setup For Practice:**
1. Use stick/alignment rod in ground as reference point
2. Position where pelvis should stay during swing

**Awareness Drill:**
- Make slow motion swings
- Stay in contact with stick throughout swing
- Feel what it's like to maintain posture
- Notice how club path moves out to right when posture maintained

**Thought 1: Right Pocket Stays Back**
1. Right pocket doesn't go AT the ball
2. Right pocket stays where it is through transition and into impact
3. LEFT pocket/hip moves BACK to right hip
4. Maintains proper posture angle

**Thought 2: Belt Buckle Distance**
1. Keep belt buckle SAME DISTANCE from ball throughout downswing
2. Don't let belt buckle move toward ball
3. Don't let it move upward
4. Maintains spine angle and posture

**Result:** Proper posture control = club path stays to right = draw spin

**Referenced in:** Video 1

### 3.3 Easy Setup Wins for Straighter Drives

**Three Setup Adjustments** *(Video 3)* - Focus on pre-swing setup rather than swing mechanics changes

#### Easy Win #1: Left Hand Grip Position

*(See detailed section 1.1 - Finding Your Natural Left Hand Grip Position)*

**For slicers - Strong grip position:**
- Hold club outside left hip
- Let hand hang naturally
- Place club in hand in this position
- Creates stronger grip that promotes forearm rotation to close club face

#### Easy Win #2: Handle Position

**Two Dimensions:**

**A. Vertical Position (Handle Height)**

**Higher handle position (BEST FOR SLICERS):**
- Encourages inside-to-out club path
- Puts left spin on ball (draw)
- Reference: "Bryson DeChambeau style"

**Lower handle position:**
- Encourages outside-to-in club path
- Puts right spin on ball (fade/slice)
- Avoid if you slice

**B. Horizontal Position (Handle Forward/Back)**

**Neutral position (recommended):**
- Let driver lie naturally on ground
- Shaft sits at 90° to ground
- Hands level with club head

**Forward position (NOT recommended for driver):**
- Reduces loft (can turn 10.5° into 0°)
- Encourages draw spin
- Good for irons, not driver

**Back position (AVOID for slicers):**
- Hands behind club head
- Encourages out-to-in swing path
- Adds right spin (makes slice worse)

**Worst setup for slicers:** Weak grip + low and back handle position

#### Easy Win #3: Forearm Alignment

**Neutral position:**
- Shoulders, feet, hips, and forearms all pointing at target
- Forearms level with each other

**Right forearm below left forearm (GOOD FOR SLICERS):**
- Encourages in-to-out swing path
- Creates draw spin, left spin on ball

**Right forearm above left forearm (GOOD FOR HOOKERS):**
- Encourages outside-to-in swing path
- Creates cut/fade spin on ball

**Referenced in:** Video 3

### 3.4 Driver Setup from Knees Down

**Optimizing Foot and Knee Position for Maximum Rotation** *(Video 2)*

*(See detailed sections 2.5 - Foot Position and 2.6 - Knee Position)*

**Key Benefits:**
- Access to maximum body rotation (most powerful movement)
- Longer drives - more radius and speed from proper rotation
- Straighter drives - ability to swing from inside, better stability
- Better back health - reduced lumbar spine stress
- Improved consistency - stable, repeatable position
- No compensations needed - body works naturally

**Referenced in:** Video 2

---

### 3.5 Adding Distance Through Power Generation

#### Creating Torque (Not Just Shoulder Turn) *(Videos 32, 45)*

**Old Teaching:** "Turn your shoulders"

**New Understanding:** Rotate the WHOLE RIB CAGE, not just shoulders

**How to Do It:**
- Think of point in middle of rib cage
- Stretch it as far away from ball as possible on backswing

**Benefits:**
- More tension in body (stores energy)
- More radius in arm swing (wider arc)
- Greater power storage (explode on downswing)
- Increased club head speed

**Sources:** Mike Adams and Terry Rolls (biomechanists)

#### Maintaining Radius *(Videos 30, 45)*

**Key Principle:** Keep hands same distance away from body from start to strike

**Benefits:**
- Maximizes radius of club head
- Maximizes speed in club head
- Keeps upper arms connected to upper body throughout
- Creates natural downward motion without forcing
- Generates leverage and rotation in right arm

**Connection vs. Disconnection:**
- Turning shoulders while swinging arms independently = disconnection
- Disconnection makes it difficult to transfer torque from body to arms
- Wide arms naturally work downwards when maintaining radius
- No need to pull club down - happens naturally with proper radius

**Mental Cue:** "Hands to upper body, hands to upper body, hands to upper body"

**Referenced in:** Videos 30, 32, 45

---

### 3.6 Red Cross Drill for Driver

**Visual Training Drill** *(Videos 31, 45)*

**Setup:**
- Draw a big red cross on golf ball
- Place cross NOT square on tee
- Turn it towards you slightly
- Angle it down a little bit

**Purpose:**
- Encourages inside and upward attack with club head
- Provides clear visual target from start to finish

**Mental Focus:**
- Instead of thinking complex swing mechanics (radius, torque)
- Simply focus on hitting the red cross with club head

**Benefits:**
1. **Inside Path:** Cross orientation promotes inside-to-out swing path
2. **Upward Attack:** Positioning helps achieve optimal upward angle for driver
3. **Simplified Focus:** Single, clear visual target to concentrate on
4. **Reduces Over-Thinking:** Eliminates need to consciously think about technical aspects

**Referenced in:** Videos 31, 45

## 4. IRON PLAY - PURE BALL STRIKING

### 4.1 Understanding the Three-Dimensional Physics of Ball Strike

**To hit ball consistently in sweet spot, must control three dimensions** *(Video 5)*:

#### X-Axis (Horizontal Low Point)
- Low point should be at ball or slightly beyond it
- Creates descending blow on ball
- Gets leading edge underneath equator of ball
- **If low point before ball:** Results in fat and thin shots
- **If low point at or beyond ball:** Creates pure strike

#### Y-Axis (Vertical Low Point)
- Controls how high or low club head comes into ball
- Requires maintaining proper posture throughout swing
- Loss of posture is one of most common problems

#### Z-Axis (Distance from Body)
- Controls how far club is from body during impact
- Critical for avoiding shanks (hitting hosel)
- Especially important on shorter, three-quarter shots

**Referenced in:** Video 5

---

### 4.2 Low Point Control - The Critical Non-Negotiable

**Andreas Cali's Low Point Concept** *(Video 40)*:

**Core Principle:**
- CENTER OF CHEST and CENTER OF PELVIS position relative to ball determines low point
- Club bottoms out opposite these body centers
- Club head reaches lowest point opposite left armpit (where swing radius greatest)
- Divot starts at center of chest/pelvis, deepest point at left shoulder

**The Low Point Must Be:**
- At the ball or just after it (target side)
- **If behind ball:** Fat shots, thin shots, inconsistent contact

**Sweet Spot Contact:**
- Leading edge needs to hit underneath ball's equator
- Around 3rd-5th groove on club face

**Referenced in:** Videos 5, 9, 12, 22, 35, 36, 37, 40

---

### 4.3 Four Essential Drills for Iron Consistency

#### Drill #1: Feet Together Drill (X-Axis Control) *(Video 5)*

**Purpose:** Control horizontal low point and prevent excessive lateral movement

**Execution:**
- **Stage 1:** Place feet together, make swings without ball
  - Feel being very central to ball position
  - Cannot move too far off center or you'll fall over
  - Low point naturally between sternum and left shoulder
- **Stage 2:** Increase swing speed while maintaining stability
  - Body remains stable, hands/arms create speed
  - Get more leverage and rotation as right arm straightens

**Key Points:**
- Horizontal low point opposite where sternum is
- Low point ranges from sternum to under left shoulder (deepest divot)
- Centralizes position relative to ball
- Can be used for both pure ball strike AND to increase speed

**Common Result:** Beautiful pure ball strike because not moving off center

#### Drill #2: Stomp Drill (X-Axis Control - Advanced) *(Videos 4, 5)*

**Purpose:** Move low point forward and prevent hanging back on ball

**Problem Addressed:**
- Many amateurs try to "help" ball up in air
- Causes horizontal low point to move further behind ball
- Results in poor contact and loss of distance

**Execution:**
1. Start in slow motion until you get coordination
2. As you finish backswing, lift left foot off ground
3. Stomp it back down as you start downswing
4. Stomp doesn't have to be step forward
5. Focus on loading the left side
6. Loading left side brings low point forward
7. Sternum moves left relative to ball
8. Moves along X-axis, bringing low point further forward

**Power Benefits:**
- Creates lateral force (moving left)
- Creates vertical force (loading into ground)
- Creates rotational force (body turn)
- All three forces combine in one powerful move

**Key Insight:** Most important aspect is influence on horizontal low point, ensuring it comes after ball

#### Drill #3: Tee to Right Pocket Drill (Y-Axis Control) *(Videos 5, 6, 20)*

**Purpose:** Maintain proper posture throughout backswing and control vertical axis

**Problem Addressed:**
- Most common problem: losing control of posture on backswing
- Club starts too flat with hands going behind shoulders
- Brings left shoulder too high
- Flat backswing pulls posture out of position (both right and up)
- Head gets pulled up and right, creating vertical and horizontal axis problems

**Execution:**
1. Hold tee in your grip (insert in grip end)
2. Point tee towards right pocket throughout backswing
3. Keep tee pointing to right pocket at takeaway, halfway back, three-quarters back
4. Creates room for left shoulder to come underneath chin
5. Left shoulder goes down, down, down (not up)
6. Maintains original height throughout backswing
7. Prevents being knocked out of original posture position

**Key Benefit:** Much easier to control height on backswing and maintain Y-axis for great ball strike

**Why It Works:** When tee points to right pocket, there's room for left shoulder to move properly under chin without disrupting posture

#### Drill #4: Head Cover Drill (Z-Axis Control) *(Video 5)*

**Purpose:** Control distance of club from body and prevent shanks

**Setup:**
- Place head cover (or sponge) about ball's width outside ball
- Focus on three-quarter or half shots (where most shanks occur)

**Problem Addressed:**
- On shorter shots, arms become very lively while body is lazy
- Instead of turning, golfers just use arms
- Left arm comes on top of rib cage and stays there
- Arm is now closer to ball
- This means hosel (socket) is closer to ball
- Results in shanks and loss of Z-axis control

**Execution:**
1. Try to hit ball while missing head cover
2. This instinctively trains proper Z-axis control
3. Forces you to keep club at proper distance from body
4. Promotes body turn rather than just arm swing
5. Prevents left arm from getting trapped on top of rib cage

**Key Understanding:** Head cover provides immediate feedback and forces proper club path and distance from body

### 4.4 Bonus: Face Tape Feedback

**Tool:** Impact tape (or foot spray, though messier) *(Video 5)*

**Purpose:**
- Provides honest feedback about strike patterns
- Shows tendencies: toe, heel, high, low hits
- Helps identify which drill (X, Y, or Z axis) you should prioritize
- "The face tape doesn't lie"

**Sweet Spot Location:**
- Usually around 4th or 5th groove
- Can vary by manufacturer and club type
- Can find it by bouncing ball on club face, listening for purest sound

**Application:**
1. Hit multiple shots with tape on face
2. Analyze the pattern
3. Determine which axis needs most work
4. Focus on drill that addresses your specific tendency
5. Fine-tune strike pattern through targeted practice

### 4.5 Low Point Control Through Body Position

#### The Alignment Stick Drill *(Videos 37, 39)*

**Setup:**
- Place alignment stick in ground next to right leg (diagonal angle)
- Right foot stays against stick

**Purpose:**
- Prevents excessive rightward shift during backswing
- Makes right thigh bone the axis of backswing
- Makes it easier to get center of chest/pelvis forward on downswing
- Promotes ball-first, divot-second contact

**Key Teaching:**
- Avoid moving too far right during backswing
- Use right thigh bone as swing axis
- Prevents shifting off to right side
- Makes downswing much easier

#### The Skater Move *(Videos 37, 40)*

**Concept (Andreas Cali):**
- Like pushing off back skate on ice to move forward
- Push under right foot to move left during transition

**Timing:**
- Start pushing left BEFORE backswing is complete
- This creates exaggerated forward movement
- So much pressure in left foot causes reactive movements

**Result:**
- Center of chest and pelvis move forward
- Low point positioned correctly
- Pure, powerful ball striking

**Scotty Scheffler Example:**
- Shows exaggerated version of skater move
- Already starting to move left early in swing
- Moved significantly left by impact
- Creates "funky footwork" due to:
  - Massive pressure in left foot (to prevent falling over)
  - Left foot reacts to pressure
  - Right foot slides forward due to extreme forward movement

**Referenced in:** Videos 37, 39, 40

### 4.6 Three Instinctive Practice Tips

#### Tip 1: The Towel Drill *(Videos 36, 40)*

**Setup:**
- Place towel on ground about one club head width behind ball

**Goal:**
- Hit ball while missing towel
- Encourages center of pelvis and chest forward at strike

**Benefits:**
- Instinctively trains proper low point placement
- Provides immediate feedback (hitting towel = incorrect)
- Simple, equipment-free training aid
- Promotes better ball-first contact

#### Tip 2: Hit the Forward Tee *(Videos 9, 35, 40)*

**Setup:**
- Place broken tee 4-5 cm (2 inches) ahead of ball

**Execution:**
- Focus eyes on tee, not ball, from start to strike
- Try to hit tee away, collecting ball on way
- Trusts instinct to position low point correctly

**Why It Works:**
- Changes task from "hitting ball" to "hitting low point"
- Creates less stressful objective
- Not trying to get ball up, send it straight, or even hit it
- Just focusing on making contact with tee/low point
- Takes mental pressure off hitting ball itself
- Removes worry about ball direction or getting it airborne

**Key Concept:**
- Ball is on ground, needs leading edge to hit underneath equator
- When focus on top of ball, subconscious tries to hit top
- Creates high likelihood of topping shot
- Looking at ball creates stress about getting it up, hitting straight, etc.

**Andrew's Most Successful Method:** With customers on golf course

#### Tip 3: Eyes Ahead (No Props) *(Video 40)*

**Setup:**
- No towel or tee needed
- Look at grass 3-4 cm ahead of ball instead of at ball

**Benefits:**
- Provides mental freedom - not thinking about "the hit"
- Naturally positions low point correctly
- Focus point becomes instinctive low point location

## 5. BACKSWING MECHANICS

### 5.1 The Rib Cage Rotation (Not Just Shoulders)

**Revolutionary Concept** *(Videos 1, 32, 45)*

**Old Teaching:** "Turn your shoulders, laddy" (Scotland)

**New Understanding:** Rotate the WHOLE RIB CAGE, not just shoulders

**Sources:** Mike Adams and Terry Rolls (biomechanists)

**The Rib Stretch Thought:**
1. Pick a rib on RIGHT side
2. On backswing, stretch this rib as FAR AWAY from ball as possible
3. Keep arms passive - let them swing WITH body rotation

**Multiple Benefits of This One Thought:**
- Automatically creates proper upper torso rotation
- Pulls pelvis into proper turn (don't need to think about it)
- Pulls weight shift to right (don't need to think about it)
- Creates SPACE needed to swing path to right
- Enables draw spin on ball
- More tension in body (stores energy)
- More radius in arm swing
- Greater power storage to explode on downswing

**Comparison:**
- **Shoulder turn only:** Limited movement, disconnection
- **Rib cage turn:** Significantly larger rotation and radius, torque creation

**Referenced in:** Videos 1, 32, 45

### 5.2 Right Arm Function - The Signature Move

**Annika Sorenstam's Technique** *(Video 38)*

**Elite Players Who Use This:** Annika Sorenstam, Tiger Woods, Brooks Koepka, Bryson DeChambeau, Rory McIlroy

**Two Roles of Right Arm:**

#### 1. Creating Leverage (Speed Generation)
- Two levers work like hammer motion to deliver speed to club head
- Lever one comes out first, lever two comes out second
- Later you release these levers, more speed you generate through impact

#### 2. Rotation (Additional Speed)
- As arms swing back and right arm bends, it also rotates
- Similar to tennis player's motion
- Rotating arm back and then through creates additional speed

**The Signature Move: Right Arm Straight Longer**

**Key Principle:**
- Keep right arm straight for as long as possible on backswing
- Focus on RIGHT arm (not commonly mentioned left arm)
- When right arm stays straight longer, it will fold DOWN instead of BACK
- Folding down creates rotation in forearms

**Benefits:**
- Power moves needed for downswing delivery
- Delivers club at speed on consistent swing path
- Control of club face
- Better coordination between arms and body
- More speed transferred through body to club head
- Creates momentum to send club flatter on way down

**Referenced in:** Video 38

---

### 5.3 The Mike Adams Drill - Right Arm Training

**Setup** *(Videos 34, 38)*:
1. Take normal stance and grip position
2. Open right hand completely (don't cheat by wrapping fingers)
3. Keep only light contact between palm and grip

**Execution:**
- Make backswing with right hand completely open
- This naturally produces:
  - Longer straight arm
  - Elbow folding down (not back)
  - Arms rotating without manipulation
  - Body engagement in backswing

**Common Fault:**
- Pulling with right hand causes elbow to fold back behind you
- This loses leverage and rotation
- Makes it difficult to create speed and deliver club from correct direction

**What You'll Feel:**
- Body very engaged in backswing
- Elbow folding late and downwards
- Lovely rotation of arms
- Momentum of club going to flatter plane on way down

**Referenced in:** Videos 34, 38

---

### 5.4 Tee to Right Pocket Drill

**David Leadbetter's "A Swing" Drill** *(Videos 6, 8, 20, 21)*

**Setup:**
- Insert golf tee into end of club grip
- Tee acts as visual reference throughout swing

**Execution:**

**Phase 1: Takeaway**
1. Normal setup position
2. On takeaway, point tee to right pocket
3. Keep tee pointing to right pocket AS LONG AS POSSIBLE
4. Creates beautiful coordination between club, hands, arms, and body
5. ENTIRE rib cage must turn on backswing

**Phase 2: Top of Backswing**
- Eventually right shoulder gets closer to grip than left shoulder
- Right arm MUST fold
- As it folds, it rotates naturally
- Tee starts to point around to ball
- Tee stays pointing at ball as long as you can on way down

**Why This Creates "Shorter" Feel:**

**Creates Naturally Upright Backswing:**
- Not trying to swing upright
- Simply turning whole rib cage with tee to right pocket
- Happens automatically

**Creates Naturally Flat Downswing:**
- Through transition, move flattens naturally
- Just by focusing on where tee is pointing

**Compact Arm Swing:**
- Upper arms stay ATTACHED to upper body
- Arm folds LATE and MORE DOWNWARDS
- Keeps arm swing nice and compact
- Prevents over-swinging

**Benefits:**
- Flattening helps with arm rotation
- Helps swing club from inside with power
- You might feel it's slightly shorter arm swing
- BUT you're not TRYING to swing shorter
- You're building WAY BETTER coordination between arm swing and body swing
- Natural swing plane development (upright to flat)
- Body-arm coordination
- Compact arm swing
- Proper transition mechanics
- Inside path and power

**Referenced in:** Videos 6, 8, 20, 21

### 5.5 Right Foot Stability

**Tip #2 in Series - Keep Right Foot Flat** *(Videos 17, 19, 21)*

**Core Principle:** To move powerfully to left, you need very STABLE right side

**The Flat Right Foot Technique:**
- Keep sole of right foot flat on floor throughout entire backswing
- Allows you to push early, forward, and left as you go into strike
- Creates "super powerful move"

**Why Backswing Feels Shorter:**

**Limitation in Rotation:**
- With right foot flat, can't rotate as much
- Pelvis reaches natural limit sooner
- **Important:** "Everybody's slightly different" - exact range varies individually

**What Happens When Right Foot Rolls:**
- Pelvis goes further
- Shoulders go further
- Arms go further
- **Negative Consequences:**
  - Tend to lose control
  - Lose torque (power potential)

**The Spring Analogy:**
- Goal: "Wind the body up like a spring"
- Flat right foot creates resistance that winds up body
- This stored energy released powerfully in downswing

**Benefits:**
- Stability creates power - stable right side enables powerful movement to left
- Quality over quantity - shorter, controlled backswing with torque better than longer without stability
- Common error correction - most golfers allow right foot to roll, losing foundation
- Individual variation - principle universal, but exact range varies by flexibility
- Foundation for downswing - flat right foot creates proper foundation for explosive, controlled downswing

### 5.6 Lower Right Leg in Concrete

**Tip #3 - Jean-Jacques Rivet's Concept** *(Videos 17, 21)*

**Source:** From Jean-Jacques Rivet, David Leadbetter's colleague who co-wrote "The A Swing"

**The Concept:**

**Visualization:**
- Imagine lower right leg is set in CONCRETE
- NO MOVEMENT in lower right leg during backswing
- Imagine you're up to knee in concrete

**What Can Move:**
- Upper body turns well
- Pelvis WILL get turned back (that's natural)
- Upper thigh WILL get pulled back behind you (that's natural)

**What Stays Still:**
- Lower right leg from knee down

**The Purpose: Maximum Torque**

**Combining Restrictors:**
1. Flat right foot (Tip #2)
2. Lower right leg in concrete (Tip #3)
3. Compact arm swing with tee to right pocket (Tip #1)

**Result:**
- You're TORQUING UP on backswing
- Creates maximum stored energy
- Enables very powerful movement on downswing

**The Feel:**

**During Backswing:**
- Body must torque up around this restriction

**During Downswing:**
- All that stored torque releases
- Power through shot with beautiful body turn on way down
- Right foot stays stable
- Right lower leg stays in concrete until release

**Referenced in:** Videos 17, 21

### 5.7 Spatial Awareness - The Blind Spot

**Critical Issue** *(Videos 11, 12)*

**The Blind Spot Problem:**
- **Definition:** When players lose awareness of where club is positioned in space during swing
- **Common Issue:** Beautiful practice swings but completely different club positions when hitting actual ball
- **Impact:** Disconnect between practice and ball swings significantly affects performance

**Swing Plane Transition:**
- **Practice Swing Pattern:** Upright to flat (the correct pattern)
- **Downswing:** Club should flatten on downswing
- **The "Angel Angle":** Andrew's concept - position where there's optimal coordination between body, hands, arms, and club

**The Role of Gravity:**
- **Natural Force:** As club swings back behind golfer, gravity naturally wants to pull it down
- **Key Principle:** Allow club to fall where it naturally wants to fall
- **Mistake to Avoid:** Fighting against gravity or losing awareness of club's natural falling motion

**Solution Approach:**
1. **Feel the Practice Swing:** Develop awareness of where club is in space during practice swings
2. **Sense the Transition:** Pay attention to feeling during transition from backswing to downswing
3. **Translate to Ball Swing:** Transfer same feeling and awareness to actual ball swing
4. **Focus on Flattening:** Maintain flattening motion through downswing

**Key Takeaways:**
1. Spatial awareness is critical - just having awareness of where club is can help enormously
2. Practice swings vs ball swings - many golfers have significant disconnect, club ends up in completely different positions
3. Work with gravity - allow club to fall naturally rather than forcing positions
4. Feel and translate - solution is to feel where club is during practice swings and consciously translate to ball swings
5. The flattening motion - proper downswing involves flattening of club plane (upright to flat)

## 6. DOWNSWING & TRANSITION

### 6.1 The NEW Downswing - Throwing Motion Principle

**Revolutionary Approach** *(Videos 13, 15)*

**Core Problem:** Golf is challenging because ball is small and stationary on ground, preventing use of body's natural, instinctive throwing motion

**The Solution:** Apply same biomechanical principles used in throwing sports to golf swing

**Natural Throwing Motion Principles:**

#### Javelin Throw:
- Run up
- Plant front foot in ground
- Push back
- Creates rotation and braking
- Speed comes from upper body and arm swing

#### Baseball Pitching:
- Big step forward
- Push into ground for rotation and braking
- Momentum and speed come from upper body and arm swing

**The Golf Challenge:**
Unlike throwing sports where projectile launched from moving position, golf requires:
- Executing motion from STATIC position
- Hitting SMALL ball lying on ground
- Overcoming mental worry about whether contact will be made

**The Downswing Elements (For Right-Handed Golfers):**

**Three Critical Components:**

1. **Plant the weight on left side**
   - Transfer weight to lead foot
   - Create stable base for power generation

2. **Push into the ground**
   - Generate force through ground reaction
   - Creates rotation in lower body

3. **Create braking**
   - Braking action helps transfer momentum
   - Allows upper body and arms to accelerate
   - Generates speed through impact

**The Sequence: Plant and Push:**
1. **Plant:** Shift weight to left side (lead side)
2. **Push:** Drive into ground with lead leg
3. **Rotate:** Ground force creates rotational power
4. **Brake:** Resistance creates "slingshot" effect
5. **Release:** Upper body and arms whip through with maximum speed

**Expected Results:**
- Generate significantly more clubhead speed
- Add at least 20 yards to drives
- Create more athletic, natural motion
- Reduce tension and overthinking

**Biomechanical Advantages:**

**Ground Reaction Force:**
- Pushing into ground creates equal and opposite force
- This force translates into rotational power
- Legs serve as power source for entire swing

**Sequential Energy Transfer:**
- Lower body initiates (plant and push)
- Rotation follows (braking creates resistance)
- Upper body accelerates (momentum transfers to arms)
- Club whips through at maximum speed

**The Braking Mechanism:**
- As lower body brakes/resists, upper body accelerates
- Similar to cracking a whip
- Creates kinetic chain reaction
- Maximizes energy transfer to golf ball

**Referenced in:** Videos 13, 15

### 6.2 The Two-Step Downswing System

**Glide and Push Method** *(Video 15)*

#### Step 1: Glide Phase

**What It Is:**
- Movement of weight toward target BEFORE backswing is complete
- Happens between halfway/3/4 back and start of downswing
- Weight begins shifting forward while upper body still completing backswing

**Key Teaching Points:**
- **Right pocket moves toward target** before top of backswing is complete
- Credit to Andreas Cali for this teaching concept
- Learned from Australian pro (name forgotten)

**Common Mistake Addressed:**

**Ben Hogan Misinterpretation:**
- Many golfers (including Andrew himself for years) wrongly try to TURN from top of backswing before weight is planted on front foot
- This leads to:
  - Loss of power
  - Steep swing
  - Outside-in path
  - Early extension

**What Hogan Actually Did:**
- Was already on left side BEFORE rotation came
- Weight transfer happened first, then rotation

**Visual Cue:**
- Using stick on ground by right hip
- Shows right hip moving off stick toward target before backswing completes
- Like Scotty Scheffler: well ahead of ball at impact

**Benefits of Glide Phase:**
- Solves myriad of problems
- **Prevents Early Extension:**
  - By getting weight on left side and pushing ground, pelvis goes back rather than toward ball
  - Belt buckle to ball distance stays constant or increases
  - No early extension issues

#### Step 2: Push

**What It Is:**
- After gliding and planting weight on left side, push hard into ground with front foot
- Uses equal and opposite forces from physics

**The Physics:**
- Harder you push down = more power/energy you get back
- Energy translates into:
  - Rotational energy in hips
  - Upward force
- Both create more speed in upper body, arms, and clubhead

**Natural Compensation:**
- Body doesn't want to fall over
- If you've glided properly, body will naturally react by pushing into ground to save balance
- Forces come somewhat naturally, but can be enhanced

**Scotty Scheffler Example:**
- Jumps because pushing so hard into ground
- Common with long drive champions
- Can be emulated for more power

**Execution:**
- Once weight is planted on left side, just push
- Everything else falls into place
- "Glide and push" repeated for emphasis

### 6.3 Common Faults Corrected

#### 1. Turning Too Early *(Video 15)*

**Problem:** Trying to rotate hips from top of backswing before weight shift
**Result:** Steep, outside-in, loss of power
**Solution:** Glide phase - shift weight first, then rotate

#### 2. Early Extension *(Video 15)*

**Problem:** Pelvis moves toward ball during downswing (what Andrew suffered from most of his career)
**Great players who dealt with it:** Jack Nicklaus, Johnny Miller
**Difficulty:** Very hard to repeat, not consistently powerful
**Solution:** Glide phase + push keeps pelvis same distance or moving away from ball

#### 3. Misunderstanding Ben Hogan's Teachings *(Video 15)*

**Common misinterpretation:** Start rotation immediately from top
**Reality:** Hogan shifted weight to left side before rotating
**Key insight:** Downswing starts before backswing is complete (glide phase)

**Referenced in:** Video 15

---

### 6.4 Proper Sequencing

**Understanding Through Throwing Analogy** *(Videos 1, 12)*

**Throwing Motion Sequence:**
1. Run up
2. Plant weight onto left side
3. Push into ground (creates rotation and vertical force)
4. Upper body rotation follows
5. Arm releases last

**Golf Swing Has SAME Sequence:**
1. From top of backswing: move LEFT (weight shift)
2. Push into ground (vertical force and rotation)
3. Behind all that: shoulders rotate
4. Finally: hands, arms, and club release

**The Scotty Scheffler Game Face** *(Videos 10, 12)*

**The Technique:**
- Keep mouth very slightly open from start to strike
- No showing of teeth, no tension in jaw

**The Benefits:**
- Loosens muscles in cheeks and face
- Relaxes shoulders, hands, and arms
- Makes proper sequencing much easier

**Understanding Sequencing:**

**Based on Throwing Motion:**
- Like throwing golf club down range (or Happy Gilmore's running start)
- Proper sequence: Ground → Hips → Body → Arms → Hands → Club head

**The Throwing Sequence Breakdown:**
1. Plant lead foot (left foot for right-handed golfers)
2. Push into ground
3. Create rotation in hips and vertical force
4. Rotation and leverage in body
5. Hands and arms follow
6. Release/deliver projectile (club head to ball)

**Golf Swing Application:**
- Move left through transition (like thrower)
- Push into ground creating rotational and vertical force
- Upper body rotation follows
- Leverage in right arm (for right-handed golfers)
- Deliver club head to ball

**Key Insight:** Keeping upper body soft and hands soft allows this natural sequencing to occur without conscious thought. Slightly open mouth helps maintain this softness.

**How To Apply Sequencing:**

**Option 1: Right Shoulder Thought**
- Keep right shoulder BEHIND you in transition
- Don't let right shoulder come in FRONT of you

**Option 2: Left Arm Thought (Justin Rose Tip)**
- Keep left arm BEHIND your shoulder level as you swing down
- Don't let it get in front

**Result:** Both thoughts change club path to swing to RIGHT, converting slice to draw

## 7. MENTAL TECHNIQUES & FEEL

### 7.1 Three Mental Solutions for Better Ball Swing

**The Core Problem** *(Video 12)*:

**Why Practice Swings Feel Better:**
- **Practice Swing = 1 Task:** Simply creating club head speed
- **Ball Swing = 3 Tasks:**
  1. Creating club head speed
  2. Striking the ball
  3. Sending it in right direction

**The Result:**
- More complexity leads to more stress and tension
- Causes shortening of muscles
- Top shots
- Poor sequencing
- Difficulty with directional control

#### Solution #1: Feel the Club (Spatial Awareness)

*(See detailed section 5.7 - Spatial Awareness - The Blind Spot)*

**Key Concept:** By feeling where club is in practice swing, you can translate same feeling into ball swing

#### Solution #2: The Scotty Scheffler Game Face

*(See detailed section 6.4 - Proper Sequencing)*

**Formula:** Relaxed jaw → Relaxed shoulders/hands/arms → Better sequencing

#### Solution #3: Look at the Low Point

*(See detailed section 4.6 - Three Instinctive Practice Tips - Tip 2 and 3)*

**The Logic:**
- Ball is on ground
- Leading edge must hit underneath equator of ball
- Low point of swing needs to be at or just after ball
- If you focus on top of ball, subconscious tries to hit top of ball

**Why It Works:**
- Changes task from hitting ball to hitting specific low point
- Reduces stress and anxiety
- Not trying to get ball up or send it straight
- Just focusing on making contact with tee/low point
- Takes mental pressure off hitting ball itself

**Alternative Focus Points:**
- A piece of grass in front of ball
- A specific spot on mat

**Bonus Tip: Driver Low Point:**
- Low point is in different place (before ball on upswing)
- Instead of looking ahead of ball, look at specific point ON ball
- Orient ball so you're looking at back/bottom portion
- Example: Focus on blue logo on back of ball
- Helps you hit ball on upswing rather than at bottom of arc

**Recommended Combinations:**
- **Combination 1:** Awareness of club (Solution #1) + Game Face (Solution #2)
- **Combination 2:** Game Face (Solution #2) + Looking at low point (Solution #3)

**All solutions share common theme:** Reduce mental complexity and physical tension to allow natural, instinctive movement

**Referenced in:** Video 12

### 7.2 Relaxation Through Jaw Position

**Unlock Your Golf Swing with Relaxed Jaw** *(Videos 10, 12)*

**The Relaxed Upper Body Technique:**
- **Core Principle:** Keeping upper body soft and hands soft allows natural sequencing
- **The Jaw Connection:** Relaxed jaw leads to relaxed shoulders, hands, and arms
- **Inspiration:** Modeled after Scotty Scheffler's swing mechanics

**Implementation Method:**
- **Mouth Position:** Keep mouth slightly open (no clenching of teeth)
- **No Tension:** Avoid any tension in jaw area
- **Bonus Tip:** Smiling also helps maintain relaxation

**Technical Benefits:**

**Improved Sequencing:**
- Relaxed upper body allows for more natural swing sequencing
- Creates better "throwing motion" in golf swing
- Eliminates need to consciously think about sequencing
- Upper body softness translates to proper kinetic chain activation

**Biomechanical Advantages:**
- **Shoulders:** More freedom of movement
- **Hands:** Better feel and control
- **Arms:** Reduced tension allows for smoother swing path
- **Overall:** More fluid and athletic motion

**Practical Application:**

**Pre-Swing Setup:**
- Check jaw tension before taking stance
- Allow mouth to be slightly open
- Consider adding slight smile for additional relaxation

**During Swing:**
- Maintain jaw relaxation throughout entire motion
- Let softness cascade from jaw → shoulders → arms → hands
- Trust natural sequencing that results

### 7.3 Focus on Low Point, Not Ball

*(See detailed section 4.6 - Three Instinctive Practice Tips)*

**The Tee Drill** *(Videos 9, 35, 40)*

**Andrew's Most Successful Method:** With customers on golf course

**Benefits:**
- Reduces anxiety and stress
- Simplifies task to just making contact with tee
- Removes pressure of directing ball or getting it airborne
- Helps transfer practice swing quality to actual ball swing

**Referenced in:** Videos 9, 35, 40

## 8. SHORT GAME - CHIPPING

### 8.1 The One Moving Part Philosophy

**Core Concept** *(Videos 23, 24)*: Simplify chipping motion by using ONE moving part: chest/rib cage rotation

**The Technique:**

**Primary Movement:** Chest/rib cage rotation only

**Arms Feel:** As if they're "stuck onto my sides"

**Distance Control:**
- Short shot = short turn
- Longer shot = longer turn

**Result:** Where body goes, hands, arms, and club follow

**Proper Setup Requirements:**
- **Posture:** Same good posture as full swing
- **Why It Matters:** Good posture allows body turn to naturally send club down toward ball
- **Grip:** Same grip as used in full swing
- **Body Position:** Tilted forward from hips (not upright)

**Referenced in:** Videos 23, 24

---

### 8.2 Common Mistakes to Avoid

**The "Windscreen Wipers" Shot** *(Video 24)*

**What It Is:**
- Bad posture (very upright, shoulders rounded, head down)
- Swing controlled by hands and arms doing their own thing
- Arms moving independently without body rotation

**Why It Fails:**
- Produces occasional good shots but very difficult to repeat
- Lacks consistency in both movement and ball reaction
- No reliable pattern for distance control

**The Solution:**
- Turn chest back and through from good posture
- Keep arms connected to body turn
- Focus on repetition of movement = repetition of ball reaction

**Referenced in:** Video 24

---

### 8.3 The Head Cover Drill

**Purpose** *(Video 23)*: Exaggerate arm connection and simplify chipping motion

**Setup:**
- Place head cover under both arms

**Application:**
- Only for really short chip shots
- Too restrictive for longer shots where arms need to bend and rotate more

**The Simple Formula:**
1. Beautiful posture
2. Beautiful grip
3. Turn back (chest rotation)
4. Turn through (chest rotation)
5. Collect ball on the way

**Training Progression:**

**For Short Chip Shots:**
- Use head cover drill to exaggerate feeling
- Focus solely on chest rotation
- Keep arms connected to body
- No independent hand or arm movement

**For Longer Shots:**
- Graduate away from head cover constraint
- Allow arms to bend and rotate more freely
- Maintain fundamental concept of body rotation

**Referenced in:** Video 23

---

### 8.4 Swing Geometry

**Key Principle** *(Video 23)*: Keep everything 90° to your spine position

**Feel:**
- Left shoulder down (backswing)
- Right shoulder down (through swing)
- Maintain: Stay in posture throughout motion

**Full Swing Connection:**
- Same 90° relationship to spine
- Proper backswing and downswing geometry
- Staying in posture throughout
- Body rotation as primary movement

**Referenced in:** Video 23

---

### 8.5 Consistency Factors

**The Chest Rotation Method Provides Consistency** *(Video 23)*:

1. **Club Face:** No manipulation - returns square consistently
2. **Swing Path:** No manipulation - consistent path through impact
3. **Loft Control:** Returns same loft to ball as at address
   - Critical for trajectory consistency

**Expected Results:**
- Simplified motion with fewer moving parts
- More consistent club face control
- More consistent swing path
- Better trajectory control through consistent loft delivery
- Improved repeatability
- Better contact

## 9. PUTTING

### 9.1 Core Fundamentals (Tips 1-10)

**Comprehensive Putting Foundation** *(Video 55)*

This section covers the first 10 fundamental putting tips from Andrew's 100-tip series, addressing body stability, head position, distance control, stroke mechanics, visualization, setup position, grip variations, acceleration, feel development, and practice drills.

#### Tip 1: Keep Your Booty Still *(Video 55)*

**Main Point:** Maintain lower body stability throughout putting stroke

**Key Principle:** If butt stays still from start to strike, ball goes where you aim

**Benefits:**
- More reliable swing path
- Better directional control
- Consistent, repeatable motion

#### Tip 2: Balance a Coin on Your Neck *(Video 55)*

**Problem Addressed:** Looking up too early on short putts

**Solution:**
- Balance a two-pence piece (or similar coin) on back of your neck
- Keep point on back of neck still from start to strike

**Benefits:**
- Prevents head movement
- Maintains consistent swing path
- Reduces pulls and pushes

#### Tip 3: Keep Your Forearms Soft *(Video 55)*

**Problem Addressed:** Poor distance control and lack of feel

**Source:** Learned from Brad Faxon in Florida

**Solution:** Focus on soft forearms rather than grip pressure

**Benefits:**
- Better pendulum motion
- Improved feedback and feel
- Better distance control

**Andrew's Emphasis:** "Something I learned from the brilliant Brad Faxon out in Florida"

#### Tip 4: Putt from Your Sternum *(Video 55)*

**Problem Addressed:** Robotic shoulder rocking that causes head waggle

**Concept:** Small sternum movement creates larger shoulder movement

**Key:** Stay connected with arms while letting sternum drive motion

**Benefits:**
- Simple, natural stroke
- No forcing shoulder rotation
- Smooth, connected motion

#### Tip 5: Clock Face Visualization for Breaking Putts *(Video 55)*

**Technique:** Imagine hole as a clock face

**Examples:**
- **Straight putt:** Ball enters at 6:00
- **Right to left:** Ball enters at 4:00
- **Left to right:** Ball enters at 7:00, 8:00, or 9:00

**Process:**
1. Read the putt
2. Pick a start line
3. Visualize ball dropping at appropriate "time"
4. Execute with that picture in mind

**Benefit:** Clear, specific mental picture for breaking putts

#### Tip 6: Avoid the Disaster Setup Position *(Video 55)*

**Critical Rule:** NEVER have your eyes beyond the ball (outside the target line)

**How to Check:**
- Drop ball from left eye (for right-handers)
- **Acceptable:** Eyes over ball or slightly inside
- **Disaster:** Eyes beyond/outside ball

**Why It Matters:**
- Eyes beyond ball creates outside-in path requiring constant compensation
- **Ideal:** Eyes over or slightly inside allows natural inside-square-inside path

**Andrew's Emphasis:** "I've never ever ever, let me emphasize this, ever seen anybody putt well from this position where the eyes are beyond the ball"

#### Tip 7: Alternative Grip for the Yips *(Video 55)*

**Problem Addressed:** Uncontrollable right-hand movement causing yips

**Source:** Learned from Mike Kanski (coach of Wyndham Clark)

**Solution:** Place right hand on wrong side of grip

**Benefits:**
- Beautiful pendulum motion
- Prevents right hand from getting too active
- Eliminates yips

**For:** Players who've tried everything else (claw grips, etc.)

**Andrew's Note:** "For all you yippers out there, hope that solves your big problem"

#### Tip 8: Don't Decelerate - Look at Front of Ball *(Video 55)*

**Problem Addressed:** Deceleration on delicate downhill putts

**Solution:** Focus eyes on front of ball (not the back)

**Psychology:** Fools brain into thinking strike point is further ahead

**Result:**
- More positive, accelerating stroke
- Maintains club face alignment
- Better control on delicate putts

**Application:** Especially useful on downhill breaking putts

#### Tip 9: Develop Feel Through Feedback Exercise *(Video 55)*

**Drill:** Hit putts without looking, then guess result

**Process:**
1. Hit the putt
2. Don't look at result
3. Ask yourself: too short, right distance, or long?
4. Then look to verify

**Benefits:**
- Rapidly develops sense of feel
- Improves distance control
- Heightens awareness of strike quality

**Variation:** Practice from different distances

#### Tip 10: Around the Clock Drill *(Video 55)*

**Andrew's Emphasis:** "If you ignore all other 99 tips, don't ignore this one"

**Setup:** Four ball positions at 1 meter from hole:
1. Straight uphill (confidence builder)
2. Right to left breaking
3. Straight downhill
4. Left to right breaking

**Training Aid:** Lay flag on ground to check:
- Club face square at address
- Swing path (inside-square-inside vs outside-in)
- Consistency of stroke

**Challenge:** Make 17 out of 20 putts before finishing

**Protocol:**
- Go around the clock 5 times (20 total putts)
- Use same routine every time (like on course)

**Impact:** Andrew claims this drill has "changed people's handicaps"

**Key Quote:** "The most powerful putting drill that I know. I have changed people's handicaps with this drill"

### 9.2 Pre-Round Practice Routine

**Tip 12 - Building Confidence and Feel** *(Video 48)*

#### Building Confidence with Short Putts:

**Setup:**
- Use tee in ground as target

**Progression:**
- Start 10-15 cm away
- Progressively increase to 1 meter
- Hitting tee builds confidence for hitting hole

#### Getting Pace/Speed:

**Method:**
- Ignore holes on practice green
- Practice stopping balls at fringe from various distances
- Try uphill, downhill, and sidehill putts

**Goal:** Develop feel for green speed before round

**Referenced in:** Video 48

---

### 9.3 Grip and Setup Fundamentals

#### The Thumbs Grip *(Videos 48, 51)*

**Source:** Taught by Jean Jacques (biomechanist, David Leadbetter associate)

**Technique:**
- Fit joints of thumbs together into natural arc on the putter grip
- Hands/fingers wrap around the back of the grip naturally
- No specific finger positioning requirements

**Benefits:**
- Beautiful roll on ball
- Ball "sticks to grass" as it takes off
- Enhanced left-right side coordination and rhythm
- Smooth roll without jumping
- Ball sets off smoothly rather than bouncing
- Eliminates erratic bouncing as ball comes off putter face

**When to Use:**
- Ideal for golfers struggling with grip positions
- Helpful for those uncertain about proper hand placement on putter
- Good alternative for players experiencing inconsistent ball roll

#### Connection in Putting *(Video 41)*

**Connected Grip (Recommended):**
- Left hand sitting a little underneath grip
- Right hand sitting a little underneath grip
- Thumbs positioned together
- Hands positioned more toward each other rather than on top of club

**Disconnected Grip (To Avoid):**
- Hands positioned more on top of grip
- Arms hanging too loose from body
- Hands facing more down to left/right
- Creates less control and feedback

**Benefits of Connection:**
- Better swing path control - easier to keep putter on correct path
- Maximum feedback - feel strike quality more clearly
- Improved pace/distance control - better sense of how hard to hit
- Keeps ball online - more consistent direction and accuracy
- Less club face rotation - more stable putter face throughout stroke

**Problems with Disconnection:**
- Less feedback from strike
- Club face more likely to "waggle all over the place"
- Reduced control of club face
- Inconsistent results

**Referenced in:** Videos 41, 48

---

### 9.4 Ball Position for Putting

**Tip #19 - Position Relative to Sternum** *(Videos 48, 50)*

**Key Point:** Position relative to STERNUM, not feet

**Goal:** Hit ball just past low point, with club slightly ascending

**Rule:** Low point is always opposite sternum

**Position:** Ball underneath left eye (for right-handed players)

**Check Method:**
1. Put second ball in left pocket
2. Set up to first ball normally
3. Drop second ball from left eye
4. Should land on top of first ball

**Result:** No backspin, clean roll without jumping

**Referenced in:** Videos 48, 50

---

### 9.5 Alignment Fundamentals

#### Aim Club Face Precisely - Tip 13 *(Video 48)*

**Key Point:** Club face direction is more important than swing path

**Demonstration:** Even with poor swing paths (outside-in or inside-out), proper face alignment sends ball on target

**Practice Methods:**
- **Cheap:** Use alignment stick on ground
- **Investment:** Use putting alignment tool (pro tutor)

**Goal:** Ensure club face is 90° to target line

#### Check Swing Path Consistency - Tip 14 *(Video 48)*

**Practice Location:** Use flat edge of green (or wall/alignment sticks)

**Ideal Path:** Inside-square-inside relative to target line

**Technique:** Swing from sternum (small movement creates big club head movement)

**Avoid:** Too many moving parts (butt, lower half, head movement)

**Result:** Consistent path combined with proper face aim = accurate putting

#### Get Your Eyes Aligned - Tip 15 *(Videos 48, 54)*

**Proper Setup:** Eyes should be parallel to target line

**The Three-Element Checklist:**
- Align **club head** to target
- Align **body** to target
- Align **eyes** parallel to target line

**Common Mistake:** Tilting head to look at hole instead of turning head

**The Problem with Head Tilting:**
- When you tilt your head, your eyes go offline
- Club head tends to swing in same direction as eye line
- If eyes are offline due to head tilt, putt will pull off to left
- Causes missed short putts despite proper club and body alignment

**The Solution:**
- **Turn your head** to look at target (correct)
- **Don't tilt your head** to look at target (incorrect)
- Keep eyes aligned parallel to target line throughout setup
- Think: "Eyes online" = ball goes in right direction

**Key Principle:** All three alignment elements matter - missing any one (especially eye alignment) can cause you to miss short putts

**Referenced in:** Videos 48, 54

### 9.6 The Putting Trigger

**Tip 23 - The Eye Trigger** *(Video 44)*

**What is a Trigger?**
- Small prompt that initiates putting stroke
- Prevents golfers from freezing over ball

**Classic Example:**
- Phil Mickelson's trigger: Forward press with hands before starting stroke

**Andrew's Solution: Using the Eyes**

**The Problem:**
- Golfers spend time carefully setting up clubface and body alignment
- Don't want to disturb careful setup with physical movement
- Still need to avoid freezing over ball

**The Solution:**
1. **Setup:** Take time to create beautiful, well-aligned setup
2. **Visualize:** Look at hole and visualize where ball will fall over edge
3. **Trigger:** As soon as eyes return to ball, immediately start stroke
4. **Execute:** No delay - clubface starts moving back as eyes come back to ball

**The Formula:** **Hole → Ball → Go**
- Look at hole (visualize)
- Eyes back to ball (trigger)
- Stroke begins immediately (no delay)

**Benefits:**
- Works for all putt lengths (short, medium, long)
- No delay in execution
- Doesn't disturb carefully established setup position
- Creates consistent routine and rhythm

**Historical Reference:**
Aaron Baddeley famously used this eye-trigger technique during highlight of his career

**Referenced in:** Video 44

---

### 9.7 Mental Approach and Visualization

#### No Practice Swing - Tip 11 *(Video 48)*

**Concept:** Trust instinctive distance control like throwing ball

**Problem:** In putting, we look at ball instead of hole

**Solution:**
- Make last look at hole most important one
- Look at hole, then immediately react without delay or conscious measurement

**Goal:** Develop natural feel for distance rather than mechanical stroke measurement

#### Visualization Technique - Tip 22 *(Video 46)*

**Key Concept:** Visualize successful outcome multiple times during pre-shot routine

**Andrew's Putting Routine:**

**1. Read the Putt:**
- Analyze break (example: left to right)
- Determine where ball should drop (example: at 8:00 on clock face)
- **First visualization:** Picture ball going in while reading

**2. Address the Ball:**
- Go straight to ball
- **No practice swing**
- Line up club
- Align body to club

**3. Final Visualization (2 looks):**
- **Look #1 at hole:** Visualize ball dropping at 8:00
- **Look #2 at hole:** Visualize ball dropping at 8:00 again
- Execute immediately after last look

**Critical Timing Principle:**
**Minimize time between last look and execution** - less time between visualization and action, the better

**Core Message:**
The more you visualize, and more focused/clear that mental picture is, greater your chances of making putts from any distance

**Takeaway:**
Incorporate multiple visualizations of success into pre-shot routine, seeing ball go in at least 3 times total (once during read, twice during address) before executing putt

#### Forget Lag Putting - Tip 21 *(Video 47)*

**The Anti-Lag Philosophy:**
- **Main Argument:** "Why on earth would you try and miss hole?"
- Questions traditional approach of lag putting where golfers aim to just get ball close
- Believes always trying to hole putt produces better results

**Visualization Technique:**
- **Always visualize success:** Picture ball going in hole from wherever you are on green
- **Instinctive distance control:** By focusing on successful outcome (holing putt), natural distance control improves
- **Specific entry point:** Visualize exactly where ball will enter hole

**Practical Application:**
- **Focus on feel at strike:** Concentrate on feeling at impact to get distance right
- **Visualize ball "dying over edge"** at specific entry point

**Key Quotes:**
- "Lag schmag. Why on earth would you try and miss hole?"
- "If you're always visualizing successful outcome from wherever you are on green, however far away you are, then you're going to get your instinctive distance control right"
- "We got to try and hold it from everywhere to try and get your pace right"

### 9.8 Advanced Techniques

#### Keep Your Mouth Soft - Tip 16 *(Video 48)*

**Technique:** Mouth slightly open, cheeks soft, tongue soft

**Benefit:** Increased feel and touch for delicate putts

**Application:** Especially useful for difficult putts (downhill, breaking putts)

**Goal:** Enhanced pace control through relaxed state

#### Downhill Putts - Tip 24 *(Video 43)*

**The Challenge:** Downhill putts difficult due to speed control issues

**The Solution: Toe Contact**

**Main Technique:** Hit ball out of toe of putter instead of sweet spot

**Why This Works:**
- Reduces energy transfer to ball
- Creates "softer" contact
- Allows for better speed control on fast downhill putts

**Fundamentals Still Apply:**
1. **Stay Positive:** Maintain positive intent with stroke
2. **Eye Position:** Look at front of ball
3. **Stroke Through:** Make sure to swing through ball (don't decelerate)

**Toe Strike Technique:**
1. **Setup:** Address ball out of toe of putter
2. **Stroke:** Make normal positive putting stroke
3. **Focus:** Still look at front edge of ball
4. **Goal:** "Set wheels in motion" with controlled speed

#### Five Foot Putts - Tip 25 *(Video 42)*

**The "Dennis Wise" Drill:**

**Setup:**
1. Find straight 5-foot putt
2. Place tee in ground at edge of hole (where you want ball to roll over)
3. No training aids needed - just simple tee

**Technique:**
- **Primary Focus:** Roll ball over pink tee (not hole itself)
- **Mental Approach:**
  - Look at tee when looking up at hole
  - Keep mental picture of tee while swinging back and through
- **Benefit:** Focusing on small, specific target helps narrow focus zone

**Why It Works:**
By concentrating on hitting very small target (tee), you:
- Create more precise focus zone
- Reduce psychological pressure of hole
- Still make putts even when slightly off target
- Build confidence on those "nasty little 5-footers"

**Referenced in:** Videos 42, 43, 48

### 9.9 Special Situations

#### Putting from the Fringe - Tip 17 *(Videos 48, 52)*

**Philosophy:** "Worst putt is always better than worst chip"

**Challenge:** Getting pace right through different grass textures

**Phil Mickelson Technique:**

**Visual Sequence:**
1. Set up with normal putting routine
2. Instead of looking "hole-ball-hole-ball"
3. Use this sequence: **Fringe edge → Hole → Ball → Go**
4. Look at where fringe meets green, then hole, then back to ball
5. Repeat this sequence before executing

**Why It Works:**
- Feeds subconscious mind critical information it needs
- Accounts for extra resistance from fringe grass vs. green grass
- Helps calibrate proper pace automatically
- Brain processes different resistance levels between fringe and green

**Execution:**
1. Aim up for any break
2. Follow eye sequence: edge of fringe → hole → ball
3. Repeat once more before executing
4. Execute immediately after last look

**Purpose:** Feed subconscious information about resistance change from fringe to green

#### Texas Wedge - Tip 20 *(Videos 48, 49)*

**The Problem:** Ball lying against fringe makes clean contact with putter difficult

**The Solution:** Use pitching wedge (or 9-iron) like putter

**Why It Works:**
1. **Better Visibility:** Can see bottom edge of club, making it easier to identify where to make contact
2. **Similar Length:** Pitching wedge not much longer than putter, maintaining familiarity
3. **Cleaner Contact:** Easier to hit ball on equator or just above equator to "top it" intentionally

**Execution Steps:**
1. **Read putt** like you normally would (identify break, speed, etc.)
2. **Grip pitching wedge** like you would hold putter
3. **Use normal putting swing mechanics**
4. **Focus on contact point:** Hit ball on equator or just above equator
5. **Minimize grass interference:** Aim to get no grass between leading edge of club and ball
6. **Adjust for conditions:** Consider height of grass behind ball

**Contact Point:**
Key is to intentionally "top" ball by hitting it on equator or just above equator, rather than trying to strike it in middle as you would with normal putt

**Advantages:**
- Much easier than trying to chip ball in this situation
- Avoids danger of getting grass between club face and ball when using putter
- Produces nice roll with ability to read and play break
- More consistent results in awkward lie situations

## 10. ESSENTIAL DRILLS & TRAINING METHODS

### 10.1 The Tee Drills Collection

#### Tee in Grip - Right Pocket to Ball *(Videos 6, 8, 20, 21)*

*(See detailed section 5.4 - Tee to Right Pocket Drill)*

**Equipment:** Golf tee inserted into grip end

**Benefits:**
- Natural swing plane development
- Body-arm coordination
- Compact arm swing
- Proper transition mechanics
- Inside path and power

#### Tee in Glove - Pointing Skyward *(Video 8)*

**Setup:**
1. Open your glove
2. Insert golf tee where Velcro overlaps
3. Tee should point upward from back of left hand
4. Alternative: Use watch face if you don't wear glove

**Execution:**
1. **Backswing:** Whether you have flying right elbow (Freddy Couples) or elbow behind you (Scottie Scheffler), focus on left hand position
2. **Top of Swing:** Get tee (or watch) pointing skyward
3. **Transition:** Maintain upward pointing direction
4. **Delivery:** This skyward pointing naturally causes right arm to fold down into proper delivery position

**Mental Approach:**
- "If we get the picture, we can get the feel"
- "If we can get the feel, we can do the movement"
- Visualize tee pointing up in air through transition

**Technical Insights:**

**Steep Swing Problems:**
- Amateur golfers with steep swings often have problems with left arm
- Loading goes onto left arm when swing comes down steep
- Flattening swing distributes weight over both arms
- Creates much better delivery position

**Weight Distribution:**
- Proper delivery position distributes force across both arms
- Reduces stress on individual joints
- Creates more sustainable, injury-free swing mechanics

**Key Teaching Points:**

**Flexibility in Backswing Positions:**
- Elbows together can work IF shoulders don't move forward
- Flying right elbow (like Freddy Couples) is acceptable
- Elbow behind you (like Scottie Scheffler) is acceptable
- Critical element is DELIVERY POSITION, not backswing position

**The Universal Goal:**
"Whatever you are, flying right elbow or elbows together without shoulders together, we want to get this position of left hand up up up and then we're in beautiful delivery."

#### Forward Tee for Low Point Control *(Videos 9, 35, 40)*

**No Right Hand Exercise - "Lobster Off"** *(Videos 33, 34)*

**Equipment:** Golf club

**Execution:**
1. Normal setup
2. Open right hand (release grip)
3. Make swings through transition
4. Without ability to push with index finger and thumb, club naturally:
   - Folds down into proper "angel angle"
   - Right elbow folds to level with or below left arm
   - Creates proper delivery position

**Benefits:**
- Proper club position at transition
- Better elbow position
- Increased lag and leverage
- Improved delivery position

3. Keep only light contact between palm and grip

**Purpose:** Train proper right arm function and positioning

**Referenced in:** Videos 4, 5, 33, 34, 38

---

### 10.5 Head Against Wall Drill

**Bonus Tip from Video 21**

**Equipment:** Your head + A wall

**Andrew's Philosophy:**
"I'm not a lover of training aids. You got to buy pieces of plastic off Amazon or wherever. We can do all these things on the driving range. Just have to be a little creative."

**The Drill Setup:**

**Position:**
1. Take setup WITHOUT club
2. Stand very CLOSE to wall with trail (right) side facing it
3. Your head should be nearly touching or just touching wall

**The Movement:**
1. Make full turn thinking of tee to right pocket
2. You won't see wall (it's behind you)
3. Try to keep head from swaying off to RIGHT hand side

**What It Teaches:**

**Feeling Maximum Torque:**
- Really FEEL body torquing up on backswing
- Head stays in place (can't sway right)
- Body must rotate around stable head position

**Combined Restrictions:**
- Restriction from flat right foot
- Restriction from lower right leg in concrete
- Compact arm swing with tee to right pocket
- NOW: Head stays stable (no right sway)

**Result:**
- You'll torque up EVEN MORE on backswing
- Creates maximum coil
- Enables powerfully explosive movement on downswing
- "Kaboom!"

**Referenced in:** Video 21

---

### 10.6 Face Tape Feedback System

*(See detailed section 4.4 - Bonus: Face Tape Feedback)*

**Equipment:** Impact tape (or foot spray)

**Purpose:**
- Provides honest feedback about strike patterns
- Shows tendencies: toe, heel, high, low hits
- Helps identify which drill (X, Y, or Z axis) to prioritize

**Application:**
1. Hit multiple shots with tape on face
2. Analyze pattern
3. Determine which axis needs most work
4. Focus on drill that addresses your specific tendency
5. Fine-tune strike pattern through targeted practice

**Referenced in:** Video 5

## CONCLUSION

This comprehensive guide synthesizes Andrew Cullen's golf instruction philosophy into a practical, detailed reference. The natural themes that emerged from analyzing 52 videos demonstrate Andrew's systematic approach to golf instruction:

1. **Setup fundamentals create the foundation** - grip, posture, balance, and alignment
2. **Body rotation and torque generate power** - not just arm swing
3. **Mental techniques simplify execution** - reducing complexity and stress
4. **Natural movement patterns trump forced positions** - work with your body
5. **Individualization matters** - what works for pros may not work for you
6. **Simple training aids are most effective** - tees, towels, alignment sticks
7. **Low point control is non-negotiable** - the X-axis determines ball striking success
8. **Visualization and feel beat mechanical thoughts** - trust instinct

**For Best Results:**
- Choose ONE area to focus on per practice session
- Use drills that address your specific tendencies
- Record yourself to identify your personal patterns
- Be patient - changes take time to integrate
- Trust the process and your natural instincts

**Remember Andrew's Core Message:**
Golf improvement comes from understanding principles, simplifying focus, working with natural body mechanics, and trusting your instincts. The best swing is one that's powerful, efficient, healthy, and uniquely yours.
