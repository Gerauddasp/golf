## QUICK START GUIDE

### How to Use This Program:

1. **Choose your session length:** 30, 60, or 90 minutes
2. **Follow the warm-up routine** - ALWAYS start here (10 min)
3. **Pick 2-3 practice stations** based on your focus area
4. **Complete drills in order** - beginner → intermediate → advanced
5. **Track your progress** - note what worked and what needs work

### Key Principles to Remember:

- **Quality over quantity** - Better to do 10 perfect reps than 50 sloppy ones
- **One thought at a time** - Andrew says men can only think of one thing during swing
- **Natural movement** - Work with your body, not against it
- **Feel before mechanics** - Get the feel first, then trust it

## WARM-UP ROUTINE (10 MINUTES)

**PURPOSE:** Wake up your body, establish feel, check fundamentals

**DO THIS EVERY SESSION - NO EXCEPTIONS**

---

### PHASE 1: Setup Check (3 minutes)

**No ball needed - just club in hand**

#### A. Grip Check (1 min)
1. **Find your natural grip:**
   - Stand straight, let left arm hang naturally
   - Notice how hand naturally rotates inward
   - Place club in hand in this natural position
   - **Check:** Can you see 2-4 knuckles? (Your natural amount)

2. **Thumb position:**
   - Use SHORT thumb position (Andrew's preference)
   - Thumb sits on top, not extended down

3. **Grip pressure:**
   - Level 3 on 1-5 scale
   - Soft enough to allow rotation, firm enough for control
   - **Advanced:** Try left hand = 4, right hand = 2

#### B. Posture Check (2 min)
1. **Mike Adams posture test:**
   - Stand straight with good posture
   - Place hands on thighs
   - Sit back and bend from hip joint
   - Slide hands down until longest finger touches TOP of kneecap
   - Feel tension in glutes
   - Let arms hang naturally

2. **Balance check:**
   - Feel pressure under balls of feet (shoelace area)
   - NOT in toes, NOT in heels
   - Stable, athletic position

3. **Center of gravity:**
   - Imagine glass of wine at belt buckle
   - Goal: Don't spill a drop during swing

**SUCCESS METRIC:** Position feels athletic and stable, like you could hold it comfortably for 30 seconds

---

### PHASE 2: Body Wake-Up (3 minutes)

**Now pick up your club**

#### A. Chest Rotation Drill (10 reps)
1. Take your posture position (no ball)
2. Pick a rib on your RIGHT side
3. Stretch that rib as FAR away as possible on backswing
4. Let arms swing WITH body (stay passive)
5. Make 10 slow-motion practice swings

**FEEL:** Your whole rib cage turning, not just shoulders

#### B. Feet Together Swings (10 reps)
1. Put feet together
2. Make half-speed swings (no ball)
3. Feel centralized position
4. Notice how body stays stable

**FEEL:** Can't move too far off center or you'll lose balance

#### C. Game Face Practice (5 reps)
1. Make practice swings with mouth SLIGHTLY open
2. No tension in jaw
3. Feel shoulders and arms soften

**FEEL:** Relaxed upper body, natural sequencing

---

### PHASE 3: Ball Contact Wake-Up (4 minutes)

#### A. Short Pitch Shots (10 balls)
- Use pitching wedge
- Targets 20-30 yards
- Focus ONLY on making clean contact
- Don't worry about where ball goes
- Just wake up the swing

**SUCCESS METRIC:** Solid contact on 7/10 shots

#### B. Mid-Range Shots (10 balls)
- Use 7 or 8-iron
- Targets 50-75 yards
- Three-quarter swings
- Focus on rhythm and balance

**SUCCESS METRIC:** Finish in balance on every shot

#### Drill 4B: Ball Position & Eye Alignment Check (3 min)
**Reference:** Master Summary Section 9.3 | Video 054 (_oS9KEdrv9M)

**Steps:**
1. Position relative to STERNUM, not feet
2. Ball underneath LEFT eye
3. **Test:** Put ball in left pocket, drop it from left eye, should land on ball on ground
4. **Eye Alignment Check:** Ensure eyes are parallel to target line
   - Eyes should NEVER be beyond the ball (outside target line)
   - Acceptable: Eyes over ball or slightly inside
   - **TURN your head** to look at hole (correct)
   - **Don't TILT your head** to look at hole (causes eyes to go offline)
5. Practice this position for 5 putts

**Success Metric:** Better instinctive distance control, more aggressive mindset

#### Drill 4K: Fringe Putting Visual Sequence (Phil Mickelson Tip) (5 min)
**Reference:** Video 052 (KVlbzMQgOqo)

**Key Principle:** Worst putt is always better than worst chip - always putt from fringe!

**Steps:**
1. Find a putt with ball on fringe, hole on green
2. Set up with normal putting routine
3. **Visual Sequence:** Fringe edge → Hole → Ball → GO
4. Repeat: Look where fringe meets green, then hole, then ball
5. This feeds your subconscious the critical information about resistance change
6. Practice 8 fringe putts of varying distances

**Success Metric:** Better pace control from fringe, ball reaches hole consistently

**Why It Works:** Accounts for extra resistance from fringe grass vs green grass, helps calibrate proper pace automatically

**ADVANCED SESSION TOTAL:** 20 minutes, 34 putts

## TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### "I'm Not Seeing Improvement"

**Check:**
1. Are you doing the warm-up? (It's not optional!)
2. Are you trying to do too much at once? (Pick ONE station)
3. Are you doing drills in order? (Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced)
4. Are you tracking what works? (Use the notes template)
5. Are you practicing the right level? (Be honest about current skill)

**Solution:** Go back to beginner level and rebuild fundamentals

---

### "I Don't Have Time for Full Sessions"

**Mini-Sessions That Work:**
- **15 min:** Warm-up (body wake-up only) + 10 putts
- **20 min:** Warm-up + One drill from your weakest station
- **25 min:** Warm-up + 10 chips + 10 putts (short game intensive)

**Remember:** 3 focused 30-minute sessions beat 1 unfocused 90-minute session

---

### "I'm Confused About Which Drill to Do"

**Simple Decision Tree:**

**Is your miss a slice?** → Driver Station (Setup Fundamentals)

**Are you hitting fat/thin?** → Iron Station (Low Point Control)

**Is chipping inconsistent?** → Short Game Station (One Moving Part)

**Are you 3-putting?** → Putting Station (Setup and Basics)

**Everything is inconsistent?** → Start with Warm-up Routine only for 2 weeks

---

### "The Range Doesn't Have X Equipment"

**Substitutions:**
- **No alignment stick?** Use your club on ground or a piece of string
- **No broken tee?** Use a coin or leaf
- **No towel?** Draw a line in dirt/sand
- **No head cover?** Use glove or rolled-up jacket
- **No impact tape?** Use baby powder or foot spray

**Remember Andrew's philosophy:** "I'm not a lover of training aids. Just have to be a little creative."

## FINAL REMINDERS

### Andrew's Core Messages:

1. **"Not everyone is the same"** - Find what works for YOUR body
2. **"Work with gravity, not against it"** - Let physics help you
3. **"Men can typically only think of one thing at a time"** - Simplify!
4. **"The face tape doesn't lie"** - Use feedback, not feelings
5. **"Most important is the feel"** - Get the picture, get the feel, do the movement

### The Three Keys to Improvement:

1. **CONSISTENCY** - Regular practice beats occasional long sessions
2. **FOCUS** - One station, one drill, one thought at a time
3. **PATIENCE** - Changes take time, trust the process
