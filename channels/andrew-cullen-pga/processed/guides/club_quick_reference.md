## 🚗 DRIVER - "G.R.I.P.S."

**Mnemonic:** **G**rip strong, **R**ib stretch, **I**nside shoulder, **P**ush left, **S**oft jaw

### Setup:
- **Strong grip**: Hold club outside left hip, natural arm hang
- **Handle HIGH**: Level with or higher than club head (not low/back)
- **Forearm**: Right forearm slightly BELOW left at address

### Swing Thoughts (Pick ONE):
1. **Rib Stretch**: Pick RIGHT rib, stretch it FAR AWAY from ball
2. **Soft Right Hand**: No "lobster fingers" - keep right hand softer than left
3. **Shoulder Behind**: Right shoulder stays BEHIND in transition
4. **Glide & Push**: Right pocket moves toward target BEFORE top, then STOMP left foot
5. **Jaw Relaxed**: Mouth slightly open, no tension

### Key Feel:
> **"Stretch rib away, soft right hand, glide and stomp"**

## 🌲 FAIRWAY WOODS - "S.W.E.E.P."

**Mnemonic:** **S**ternum over, **W**ide turn, **E**ven levels, **E**asy tempo, **P**ush brush

### Setup:
- **Ball Position**: Opposite left heel (inside heel)
- **Grip**: Grip down slightly for better control
- **Sternum**: Keep chest center covering ball (don't lean back)
- **Trust the loft**: Resist urge to scoop

### Swing Thoughts (Pick ONE):
1. **Sweep Motion**: Brush the grass, not dig - "bruise the ground"
2. **Keep Levels**: Maintain body height through impact
3. **Big Hip Turn**: Full backswing rotation without swaying
4. **Ball First**: Hit ball first, then brush turf

### Key Feel:
> **"Keep levels, brush the grass"**

**Common Mistake:** ❌ Leaning back to "help" ball up (causes tops/thins)

## 🔷 HYBRIDS - "B.L.E.N.D."

**Mnemonic:** **B**all forward, **L**ike iron swing, **E**ven weight, **N**o scoop, **D**escending

### Setup:
- **Ball Position**: Just forward of center (under left pec/ear)
- **Stance**: Shoulder-width or slightly wider
- **Sternum**: Tiny tilt back from ball (not centered over it)
- **Weight**: Even distribution or slight favor to lead leg
- **Shaft**: Touch of lean forward, but not excessive

### Swing Thoughts (Pick ONE):
1. **Iron-Like**: Descending blow, ball-then-ground contact
2. **Sweep with Intent**: Feel like taking divot (wide sole prevents actual divot)
3. **Add Speed**: Don't be afraid to give it a hit - sole provides forgiveness
4. **Sternum Position**: Chest slightly back at setup, forward at impact

### Key Feel:
> **"Sweep with intent to bruise ground"**

**Common Mistake:** ❌ Playing it like fairway wood (too much sweep) OR getting too steep

**Reference:** Web research + YouTube (Rick Shiels, Mark Crossfield)

## ⚙️ IRONS - "C.E.P.S."

**Mnemonic:** **C**enter forward, **E**yes ahead, **P**ush left, **S**tay down

### Setup:
- **Ball Position**: Middle of stance (center between feet)
- **Center of Mass**: At ball or ahead (THE non-negotiable)
- **Balance**: Pressure under balls of feet

### Swing Thoughts (Pick ONE):
1. **Eyes Ahead**: Look at grass 3-4 cm AHEAD of ball (not at ball)
2. **Skater Push**: Push under right foot to move LEFT early
3. **Belt Buckle**: Keep same distance from ball throughout
4. **Chest Forward**: Center of chest/pelvis at or ahead of ball at impact
5. **Game Face**: Jaw relaxed, mouth slightly open

### Key Feel:
> **"Eyes ahead, chest forward, collect the ball"**

**Reference:** Master Summary Sections 2.3, 4.2-4.6, 7.2

## 🔪 WEDGES (Chipping) - "S.A.C.T."

**Mnemonic:** **S**ame setup, **A**rms stuck, **C**hest turns, **T**urn = distance

### Setup (Critical!):
- **Posture**: SAME as full swing - NOT upright with rounded shoulders
- **Grip**: SAME as full swing
- **Position**: Tilted forward from hips (athletic)

### Swing Concept:
- **ONE Moving Part**: Chest/rib cage rotation ONLY
- **Arms**: Feel "stuck to sides" - no independent hand/wrist action
- **Distance Control**: Short turn = short chip, long turn = longer chip

### Swing Thoughts (Pick ONE):
1. **Chest Only**: ONE moving part - chest rotation
2. **Shoulder Geometry**: Backswing = LEFT shoulder down, Through = RIGHT shoulder down
3. **Stay in Posture**: Everything 90° to spine throughout

### Key Feel:
> **"Good posture, chest turns, arms are passengers"**

**Avoid:** ❌ "Windscreen wipers" (independent hands/arms), standing upright, using wrists

**Reference:** Master Summary Sections 8.1-8.5

## 🎯 PUTTER - "F.A.V.E.S."

**Mnemonic:** **F**ace aim, **A**lways hole it, **V**isualize 3x, **E**yes trigger, **S**oft forearms

### Setup Fundamentals:
- **Ball Position**: Under LEFT eye (sternum reference)
- **Eye Alignment**: NEVER beyond ball (disaster) - must be over or inside
  - ✅ **TURN head** to look at hole
  - ❌ **Don't TILT head** (eyes go offline)
- **Face Aim**: Club face determines 85% of start line - get this square FIRST

### Pre-Stroke Routine:
1. **Visualize Success 3x**:
   - Once while reading putt
   - Twice during address (two looks at hole)
2. **Clock Face for Breaks**:
   - Straight: 6:00
   - Right to left: 4:00
   - Left to right: 7:00-9:00
3. **NO Practice Swing**: Trust instinct

### Execution:
- **Eye TRIGGER**: **Hole → Ball → GO** (no delay, no freeze)
- **Soft Forearms**: Focus on soft forearms (not grip pressure)
- **Always Hole It**: Never "lag" - always visualize making it

### Special Situations:
- **Downhill**: Hit from TOE of putter, look at FRONT of ball
- **Fringe**: Eye sequence = **Fringe edge → Hole → Ball → GO**
- **5-Footers**: Visualize specific entry point at edge

### Key Feel:
> **"Soft forearms, see it drop, hole→ball→go"**

**Reference:** Master Summary Sections 9.1-9.9

## 🧠 THE "ONE THOUGHT" RULE

**Pick ONE thought per shot based on your miss pattern:**

### 🚗 DRIVER:
- **Slicing?** → "Rib stretch away"
- **Good contact but no power?** → "Glide and push"
- **Inconsistent?** → "Soft right hand"

### 🌲 FAIRWAY WOODS:
- **Topping?** → "Keep levels, sternum over ball"
- **Fat shots?** → "Sweep, brush the grass"
- **Inconsistent?** → "Big hip turn, trust the loft"

### 🔷 HYBRIDS:
- **Thin/topped?** → "Descending blow, ball then ground"
- **Too much sweep?** → "Like an iron swing"
- **Lack of distance?** → "Add speed, trust the sole"

### ⚙️ IRONS:
- **Fat/thin?** → "Eyes ahead of ball"
- **Consistent but weak?** → "Push left early"
- **Good strikes?** → "Just stay down"

### 🔪 WEDGES:
- **Inconsistent?** → "Chest only"
- **Good contact?** → "Just feel the turn length"
- **Distance control?** → "Short turn = short, long turn = long"

### 🎯 PUTTING:
- **Short putts?** → "Face aim + hole→ball→go"
- **Distance control?** → "Soft forearms + visualize"
- **Breaking putts?** → "Clock face + always hole it"
