**Quick Solutions When Things Go Wrong**

*Use this when you're frustrated and need immediate help*

## 🚨 "I'M NOT SEEING IMPROVEMENT"

### Check These 5 Things:

**1. Are you doing the warm-up?**
- [ ] **It's not optional!** See [00_warm_up.md](00_warm_up.md)
- Skipping warm-up = inconsistent results
- Body needs time to wake up and establish feel

**2. Are you trying to do too much at once?**
- [ ] **Pick ONE station per session**
- [ ] **Pick ONE drill within that station**
- [ ] **Pick ONE swing thought**
- Quality beats quantity every time

**3. Are you doing drills in order?**
- [ ] Start with BEGINNER level drills first
- [ ] Master them before moving to intermediate
- [ ] Don't skip levels (ego trap!)
- See [01_quick_drill_finder.md](01_quick_drill_finder.md) for [B], [I], [A] tags

**4. Are you tracking what works?**
- [ ] Use [02_session_planner.md](02_session_planner.md) notes section
- [ ] Write down what felt good
- [ ] Review before next session
- Can't improve what you don't measure

**5. Are you practicing the right level?**
- [ ] **Be honest** about current skill
- [ ] If Intermediate drills aren't working, drop back to Beginner
- [ ] No shame in rebuilding fundamentals
- Tour pros practice basics constantly

### 💡 Solution:

**Go back to beginner level for 2 weeks and rebuild fundamentals:**

**Week 1:** Warm-up + Driver Setup (Drills 1A, 1B, 1C) + Putting Basics
**Week 2:** Warm-up + Iron Low Point (Drills 2A, 2B, 2C) + Chipping Basics

## ⏰ "I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR FULL SESSIONS"

### Mini-Sessions That Actually Work:

**15-Minute Power Session:**
- 5 min: Body wake-up only (Phase 2 from warm-up)
- 10 min: 10 putts (Around the Clock at 3 feet only)
- **Benefit:** Confidence builder, minimal time

**20-Minute Targeted Session:**
- 5 min: Quick warm-up (skip ball contact phase)
- 15 min: ONE drill from your weakest area
- **Benefit:** Focused improvement on specific issue

**25-Minute Short Game Intensive:**
- 5 min: Warm-up
- 10 min: 15 chips (chest rotation only)
- 10 min: 15 putts (face aim + eye trigger)
- **Benefit:** Where you save the most strokes

### 💡 The Truth:

**3 focused 30-minute sessions** beat **1 unfocused 90-minute session**

### Andrew's Philosophy:

*"Most important is the feel" - not the time spent*

## 🤔 "I'M CONFUSED ABOUT WHICH DRILL TO DO"

### Simple Decision Tree:

**STEP 1: What's your MISS?**

#### Is your miss a SLICE?
→ **Start:** Driver Station → Beginner Drills 1A, 1B, 1C (Setup)
→ **Reference:** [01_quick_drill_finder.md](01_quick_drill_finder.md#driver-drills)

#### Are you hitting FAT/THIN?
→ **Start:** Iron Station → Beginner Drills 2A, 2B, 2C (Low Point Control)
→ **Reference:** [01_quick_drill_finder.md](01_quick_drill_finder.md#iron-drills)

#### Is CHIPPING inconsistent?
→ **Start:** Short Game Station → Beginner Drills 3A, 3B (One Moving Part)
→ **Reference:** [01_quick_drill_finder.md](01_quick_drill_finder.md#chipping-drills)

#### Are you 3-PUTTING?
→ **Start:** Putting Station → Beginner Drills 4B, 4D (Setup & Face Aim)
→ **Reference:** [01_quick_drill_finder.md](01_quick_drill_finder.md#putting-drills)

#### EVERYTHING is inconsistent?
→ **Start:** Do ONLY warm-up routine for 2 weeks
→ **Reference:** [00_warm_up.md](00_warm_up.md)
→ **Why:** Build foundation first, then add drills

**STEP 2: Use Session Planner**

Fill out [02_session_planner.md](02_session_planner.md) with your chosen drill **BEFORE** leaving home.

## 🛠️ "THE RANGE DOESN'T HAVE X EQUIPMENT"

### Substitutions That Work:

**No alignment stick?**
→ Use your club laid on ground
→ Use a piece of string
→ Use the line on the mat
→ Use a club shaft

**No broken tee?**
→ Use a coin
→ Use a leaf
→ Use a small pebble
→ Draw a mark in dirt/sand with tee

**No towel?**
→ Draw a line in dirt/sand
→ Use your glove
→ Use a piece of clothing
→ Just visualize the line

**No head cover?**
→ Use rolled-up glove
→ Use rolled-up jacket
→ Use alignment rod held under arms
→ Just feel the connection

**No impact tape?**
→ Use baby powder on face
→ Use foot spray (messier)
→ Hit off wet grass (shows marks)
→ Pay attention to sound/feel

**No sharpie for red cross?**
→ Use logo on ball as reference
→ Pick a specific dimple to focus on
→ Just visualize the target spot

### 💡 Andrew's Philosophy:

*"I'm not a lover of training aids. Just have to be a little creative."*

**The best training aid is awareness and feel!**

## 😤 "I HAD A TERRIBLE SESSION"

### This Happens to EVERYONE (Even Tour Pros)

**What NOT to Do:**
- ❌ Beat yourself up mentally
- ❌ Practice longer to "fix it" (makes it worse)
- ❌ Try new techniques mid-session
- ❌ Abandon what was working before
- ❌ Compare yourself to others at range

**What TO Do:**
- ✅ Stop practice early (seriously!)
- ✅ Go home and review notes from last GOOD session
- ✅ Trust that "off days" are normal
- ✅ Come back tomorrow with fresh mind
- ✅ Go back to basics (warm-up only)

### The 3-Session Rule:

**If you've had 3 bad sessions in a row:**

1. **Take 3 days off** (mental reset)
2. **Review basics:** Read master_summary.md Sections 1-2 (grip & setup)
3. **Return to beginner drills** (rebuild foundation)
4. **Film your swing** (phone camera on tripod)
5. **Focus on FEEL not mechanics** (Andrew's way)

### Andrew's Core Message:

*"Not everyone is the same" - what works for others may not work for you*

**Trust YOUR feels, not external validation**

## 🔀 "MY SWING THOUGHT STOPPED WORKING"

### This Is Normal and Expected

**Why It Happens:**
- Body adapts to feelings over time
- What felt "strong" becomes "normal"
- Need to refresh or rotate swing thoughts

**What To Do:**

**Option 1: Exaggerate the Feel**
- If "soft right hand" stopped working
- Try "VERY soft right hand" (pressure level 1)
- Re-sensitize yourself to the feeling

**Option 2: Rotate to Different Thought**
- Driver thoughts: Rib stretch → Glide & push → Soft hand → Shoulder behind
- Iron thoughts: Eyes ahead → Push left → Belt buckle stable → Chest forward
- Chip thoughts: Chest only → Shoulders down → Turn length
- Putt thoughts: Face aim → Soft forearms → Eye trigger → Visualize 3x

**Option 3: Go Back to Warm-Up**
- Stop ball hitting for 10 minutes
- Do Phase 2 body wake-up again
- Re-establish grip, posture, balance
- Rebuild from foundation

**Option 4: Try "No Thought" Round**
- Just hit balls with pure instinct
- No mechanics, no thoughts
- See what your body naturally wants to do
- Often reveals what's really happening

### 💡 Andrew's Guidance:

*"Most important is the feel" - not the words you use*

**The feeling matters more than the thought**

## 📉 "MY BALL FLIGHT CHANGED SUDDENLY"

### Quick Diagnosis:

**New SLICE appeared:**
→ Check: Grip weakened? Hands shifted clockwise?
→ Check: Right hand got tense? ("Lobster" crept back in?)
→ **Fix:** Drills 1A (strong grip), 1E (soft right hand)

**New HOOK appeared:**
→ Check: Grip too strong now? Hands shifted counter-clockwise?
→ Check: Path now too in-to-out?
→ **Fix:** Slight grip adjustment, check forearm alignment (1C)

**Now hitting FAT:**
→ Check: Weight staying back on right side?
→ Check: Low point moved behind ball?
→ **Fix:** Drills 2B (eyes ahead), 2G (stomp), 2H (push left)

**Now hitting THIN:**
→ Check: Standing up through impact?
→ Check: Ball position too far forward?
→ **Fix:** Drill 2A (feet together), check belt buckle stable

**Lost DISTANCE:**
→ Check: Lost rib rotation? Swinging only arms?
→ Check: Not pushing into ground on downswing?
→ **Fix:** Drills 1D (rib stretch), 1H (glide & push)

### ⚠️ Most Common Cause:

**Setup changed without you noticing!**

**Solution:**
1. Go through warm-up Phase 1 (setup check) very slowly
2. Check ALL fundamentals: grip, posture, ball position, alignment
3. Film yourself to compare to when it was working
4. Reference: [00_warm_up.md](00_warm_up.md) Phase 1

## 💭 "I'M OVER-THINKING ON THE COURSE"

**Problem:** Practice feels great, course play is terrible

**Cause:** Too many swing thoughts during actual round

**Solution: Use the On-Course Quick Reference**

→ **File:** [club_quick_reference.md](../club_quick_reference.md)
→ **Rule:** Pick ONE thought ONLY
→ **Method:** Use decision tree based on miss pattern

**Pre-Round Routine:**

1. **Before round:** Pick your ONE thought for the day
2. **Write it down:** On scorecard or glove
3. **Stick with it:** All 18 holes, don't change mid-round
4. **Examples:**
   - Driver: "Soft right hand"
   - Irons: "Eyes ahead"
   - Wedges: "Chest only"
   - Putts: "Hole→ball→go"

**Andrew's Core Rule:**

*"Men can typically only think of ONE thing at a time during swing"*

**On course = even less mental capacity (pressure, distractions)**

## 🔄 "I KEEP MAKING THE SAME MISTAKE"

### Pattern Recognition Needed

**Step 1: Track It**
Use [progress_tracker.md](progress_tracker.md) session notes:
- What's the mistake?
- When does it happen? (tired? specific club? pressure situation?)
- How often? (1/10 shots? 5/10 shots?)

**Step 2: Find the Root Cause**

**Is it SETUP?**
- Film your setup from face-on and down-the-line
- Compare to warm-up checklist positions
- Usually: grip, ball position, or posture

**Is it MOTION?**
- Film your swing (even just backswing)
- Look for ONE major issue (not ten small ones)
- Check spatial awareness (the "blind spot" - master_summary Section 5.7)

**Is it MENTAL?**
- Are you tense? (jaw clenched, shoulders tight?)
- Are you trying too hard on this specific shot?
- Are you focused on result instead of process?

**Step 3: Pick ONE Drill**

Don't try to fix everything. Pick the ONE drill that addresses the root cause:

**Setup issues** → Warm-up Phase 1 (slow and detailed)
**Motion issues** → ONE station drill (beginner level)
**Mental issues** → Game face drill (2I) or visualization (4F)

**Step 4: Deliberately Practice THE MISTAKE**

*Yes, you read that right!*

**Purpose:** Build awareness
**Method:**
- Hit 5 balls TRYING to make the mistake (exaggerate it)
- Then hit 5 balls doing the OPPOSITE (exaggerate correction)
- Then hit 10 balls with normal feel
- Body learns the difference through contrast

**Example:** If you're coming over the top:
- 5 swings: REALLY come over the top (feel it)
- 5 swings: REALLY swing from inside (feel it)
- 10 swings: Normal, trusting body to find middle
