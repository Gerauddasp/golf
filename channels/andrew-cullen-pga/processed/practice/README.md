## 🗂️ HOW THIS DIFFERS FROM PRACTICE_PROGRAM.MD

### Old System (practice_program.md):
- 32KB comprehensive file
- Mixed skill levels in each station
- Hard to navigate on phone
- Study/reference focused

### New System (practice/ folder):
- Split into 5-10KB files
- Skill levels organized [B], [I], [A]
- Mobile-optimized
- **Action-focused for "during practice" use**

### Both Are Valuable:

**Use practice_program.md for:**
- Deep study at home
- Understanding complete system
- Reference for detailed explanations

**Use practice/ folder for:**
- Quick reference at range
- Planning sessions
- Tracking progress
- Mobile access

2. **"Men can typically only think of ONE thing at a time"**
   - Session planner forces you to pick ONE focus
   - Drill finder helps identify ONE key feel

3. **"Most important is the feel"**
   - Each drill includes "Key Feel" section
   - Progress tracker helps identify YOUR feels

4. **"Work with gravity, not against it"**
   - Natural movement patterns emphasized
   - No forced positions

5. **"Trust your instincts"**
   - Troubleshooting helps when you're stuck
   - But encourages self-discovery

## 🆘 NEED HELP?

### File Structure Confused?

**Simple rule:**
- **00_warm_up.md** = Always do first
- **01_quick_drill_finder.md** = When you need to find a drill
- **02_session_planner.md** = Before and after each session
- **troubleshooting.md** = When stuck
- **progress_tracker.md** = Monthly reviews

### Still Using Old practice_program.md?

That's fine! These files are designed to **complement** it, not replace it.

**Suggested hybrid approach:**
- Study practice_program.md at home (deep learning)
- Use practice/ folder at range (quick reference)

### Can't Find Something?

**Use Cmd+F / Ctrl+F to search:**
- Open 01_quick_drill_finder.md
- Search for problem, club, or drill name
- Find drill instantly
