# ⏱️ 10-MINUTE WARM-UP ROUTINE

**DO THIS EVERY SESSION - NO EXCEPTIONS**

*Purpose: Wake up your body, establish feel, check fundamentals*

---

## 📍 PHASE 1: SETUP CHECK (3 minutes)

**No ball needed - just club in hand**

### A. Grip Check (1 min)

1. **Find your natural grip:**
   - Stand straight, let left arm hang naturally
   - Notice how hand naturally rotates inward
   - Place club in hand in this natural position
   - **Check:** Can you see 2-4 knuckles? (Your natural amount)

2. **Thumb position:**
   - Use SHORT thumb position (Andrew's preference)
   - Thumb sits on top, not extended down

3. **Grip pressure:**
   - Level 3 on 1-5 scale
   - Soft enough to allow rotation, firm enough for control
   - **Advanced:** Try left hand = 4, right hand = 2

### B. Posture Check (2 min)

1. **Mike Adams posture test:**
   - Stand straight with good posture
   - Place hands on thighs
   - Sit back and bend from hip joint
   - Slide hands down until longest finger touches TOP of kneecap
   - Feel tension in glutes
   - Let arms hang naturally

2. **Balance check:**
   - Feel pressure under balls of feet (shoelace area)
   - NOT in toes, NOT in heels
   - Stable, athletic position

3. **Center of gravity:**
   - Imagine glass of wine at belt buckle
   - Goal: Don't spill a drop during swing

**✅ Success Metric:** Position feels athletic and stable, like you could hold it comfortably for 30 seconds

## 🔄 PHASE 2: BODY WAKE-UP (3 minutes)

**Now pick up your club**

### A. Chest Rotation Drill (10 reps)

1. Take your posture position (no ball)
2. Pick a rib on your RIGHT side
3. Stretch that rib as FAR away as possible on backswing
4. Let arms swing WITH body (stay passive)
5. Make 10 slow-motion practice swings

**FEEL:** Your whole rib cage turning, not just shoulders

### B. Feet Together Swings (10 reps)

1. Put feet together
2. Make half-speed swings (no ball)
3. Feel centralized position
4. Notice how body stays stable

**FEEL:** Can't move too far off center or you'll lose balance

### C. Game Face Practice (5 reps)

1. Make practice swings with mouth SLIGHTLY open
2. No tension in jaw
3. Feel shoulders and arms soften

**FEEL:** Relaxed upper body, natural sequencing

## ⚾ PHASE 3: BALL CONTACT WAKE-UP (4 minutes)

### A. Short Pitch Shots (10 balls)

- Use pitching wedge
- Targets 20-30 yards
- Focus ONLY on making clean contact
- Don't worry about where ball goes
- Just wake up the swing

**✅ Success Metric:** Solid contact on 7/10 shots

### B. Mid-Range Shots (10 balls)

- Use 7 or 8-iron
- Targets 50-75 yards
- Three-quarter swings
- Focus on rhythm and balance

**✅ Success Metric:** Finish in balance on every shot
