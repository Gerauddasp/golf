## Overview
Putting tip #22 of 100 focusing on visualization in the pre-shot routine to improve putting success rate.

## Key Concept
**Visualize a successful outcome multiple times** during your pre-shot routine to increase the likelihood of making putts.

## Andrew's Putting Routine

### 1. Read the Putt
- Analyze the break (example: left to right)
- Determine where the ball should drop (example: at 8:00 on the clock face)
- **First visualization**: Picture the ball going in while reading

### 2. Address the Ball
- Go straight to the ball
- **No practice swing**
- Line up the club
- Align body to the club

### 3. Final Visualization (2 looks)
- **Look #1 at hole**: Visualize the ball dropping at 8:00
- **Look #2 at hole**: Visualize the ball dropping at 8:00 again
- Execute immediately after the last look

## Critical Timing Principle
**Minimize the time between your last look and execution** - the less time between visualization and action, the better.

## Core Message
The more you visualize, and the more focused/clear that mental picture is, the greater your chances of making putts from any distance.

## Takeaway
Incorporate multiple visualizations of success into your pre-shot routine, seeing the ball go in at least 3 times total (once during read, twice during address) before executing the putt.
