## Overview

Andrew Cullen presents a simple yet effective golf swing drill called "tee to the right pocket" that helps golfers achieve proper swing plane and coordination between arms and body. This technique, inspired by David Leadbetter's work, naturally creates an upright backswing and flatter downswing path, leading to more powerful and consistent ball striking.

## Key Teaching Points

### Main Concept: Tee to the Right Pocket Drill

**Setup:**
- Insert a tee into the grip end of your club
- The tee acts as a visual reference point throughout the swing

**Execution:**
- During the takeaway, point the tee toward your right pocket (for right-handed golfers)
- Keep the tee pointing at the right pocket for as long as possible during the backswing
- This forces proper chest and rib cage rotation
- At transition, the tee naturally rotates to point at the ball
- Maintain the tee pointing at the ball as long as possible on the downswing

---

## Technical Benefits

### 1. Natural Swing Plane Development
- **Upright Backswing:** The drill automatically creates an upright swing plane without conscious effort
- **Flatter Downswing:** Naturally flattens through the transition for optimal ball striking
- **No Manipulation Required:** Simply focusing on the tee position creates proper mechanics

### 2. Body-Arm Coordination
- Creates beautiful synchronization between club, hands, arms, and body
- Promotes complete rib cage and chest turn on the backswing
- Keeps upper arms connected to upper body throughout the swing

### 3. Compact Arm Swing
- Makes the arm swing naturally compact and efficient
- The right arm folds later and more downward
- Prevents overswinging or disconnected arm action
- May feel like a shorter backswing, but it's actually more coordinated

### 4. Proper Transition Mechanics
- As the right shoulder gets closer to the grip than the left shoulder, the right arm naturally folds
- The folding creates automatic rotation
- Helps flatten the swing plane naturally through transition

### 5. Inside Path and Power
- The flattening motion helps rotate the arms properly
- Promotes swinging from inside the target line
- Generates more power through proper sequencing
- Creates a natural "throwing motion" in the golf swing

## Key Technical Details

### Backswing Phase
- **Initial Movement:** Tee points to right pocket
- **Mid-Backswing:** Maintains right pocket direction while chest/rib cage rotates
- **Top of Swing:** Right arm folds as right shoulder approaches grip
- **Natural Rotation:** Tee begins pointing toward ball as arm folds

### Downswing Phase
- **Transition:** Tee rotates to point at ball
- **Downswing:** Maintain tee pointing at ball as long as possible
- **Impact Zone:** Natural release from inside the target line
- **Result:** More powerful, consistent ball striking

---

## Common Misconceptions Addressed

1. **"Am I shortening my swing?"**
   - No, you're creating better coordination, not consciously shortening
   - The compact feel comes from proper synchronization, not restriction

2. **"Should I try to swing upright?"**
   - No, simply focus on the tee position
   - The upright backswing happens automatically

3. **"This feels different from my current swing"**
   - The drill builds better coordination patterns
   - Focus on the process (tee position), not forcing positions

---

## Practice Recommendations

### Slow Motion Practice
- Start with slow practice swings as demonstrated
- Focus entirely on tee position
- Feel the natural body rotation required
- Notice how the arm fold happens automatically

### Progressive Steps
1. Practice the feel with slow swings
2. Repeat "right pocket, right pocket, right pocket" as a mental cue
3. Allow the natural flip/rotation at transition
4. Progress to full speed swings maintaining the feel
5. Focus on the natural throwing motion

## Source Reference

Andrew credits this concept to **David Leadbetter's "A Swing"** book, which he describes as "brilliant." This demonstrates how established teaching principles can be simplified into practical, easy-to-execute drills.

## Target Audience

- **Golfers struggling with:**
  - Swing plane issues
  - Lack of body rotation
  - Disconnected arm and body motion
  - Coming over the top
  - Inconsistent ball striking

- **Skill Level:** All levels - the drill is simple enough for beginners yet addresses sophisticated swing mechanics

---

## Practical Application Tips

1. **Visual Aid:** The tee provides immediate feedback - you can see if it's pointing correctly
2. **Mental Cue:** Simple phrase "tee to right pocket" is easy to remember on the course
3. **Feel-Based:** Creates kinesthetic awareness of proper rotation and coordination
4. **Transferable:** Once the feel is learned, you can maintain it without the actual tee

---

## Key Takeaway

This "tee to the right pocket" drill solves multiple swing issues simultaneously by creating proper coordination between arms and body. Rather than trying to manipulate multiple swing positions, golfers can focus on one simple reference point (the tee) and let proper mechanics develop naturally. The result is an upright backswing, compact arm swing, proper transition, and powerful inside delivery - all from one simple focal point.

## Lefty Adaptation

Andrew briefly notes that left-handed golfers should "just think in reverse" - the tee would point to the left pocket for lefties, with all other principles remaining the same.
