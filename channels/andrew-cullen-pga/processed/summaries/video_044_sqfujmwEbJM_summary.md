## Overview
Andrew Cullen shares his most effective putting trigger technique to avoid freezing over the ball while maintaining proper setup alignment.

## Key Concept: The Eye Trigger

### What is a Trigger?
A trigger is a small prompt that initiates the putting stroke, preventing golfers from freezing over the ball.

### Classic Example
- **Phil Mickelson's Trigger:** A forward press with the hands before starting the stroke

### Andrew's Solution: Using the Eyes

**The Problem:**
- Golfers spend time carefully setting up clubface and body alignment
- Don't want to disturb this careful setup with physical movement
- Still need to avoid freezing over the ball

**The Solution:**
Andrew uses his eyes as the trigger rather than any physical movement:

1. **Setup:** Take time to create a beautiful, well-aligned setup
2. **Visualize:** Look at the hole and visualize where the ball will fall over the edge
3. **Trigger:** As soon as the eyes return to the ball, immediately start the stroke
4. **Execute:** No delay - the clubface starts moving back as the eyes come back to the ball

### The Formula
**Hole → Ball → Go**

- Look at hole (visualize)
- Eyes back to ball (trigger)
- Stroke begins immediately (no delay)

## Benefits
- Works for all putt lengths (short, medium, long)
- No delay in execution
- Doesn't disturb carefully established setup position
- Creates consistent routine and rhythm

## Historical Reference
Andrew mentions that Aaron Baddeley famously used this eye-trigger technique during the highlight of his career.

## Key Takeaway
By using your eyes as the trigger - looking at the hole, then back to the ball - you create a smooth, automatic transition into your putting stroke without freezing or disturbing your setup alignment.
