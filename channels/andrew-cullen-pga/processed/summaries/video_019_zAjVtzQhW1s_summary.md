## Overview

This video presents **Tip #2** in a series, focusing on keeping the right foot flat during the backswing as a fundamental technique for generating power and stability in the golf swing. Andrew Cullen explains how this simple adjustment creates a stable foundation that enables powerful forward and rotational movement through impact.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Right Foot Stability for Power Transfer
- **Core Principle:** To move powerfully to the left (for right-handed players), you need a very stable right side
- **Connection to Athletic Movement:** Andrew references a throwing motion demonstrated earlier, showing how stability on one side enables powerful movement to the other
- **The Mechanics:** The right foot stays flat on the floor and pushes toward the left side before rotation and release

### 2. The Problem with Rolling the Right Foot
- **Common Mistake:** Rolling to the outside of the right foot (letting it roll onto its outer edge)
- **Frequency:** Andrew states this is "a very common mistake" that he corrects "almost on a daily basis"
- **Consequence:** Without stability in the right foot, it becomes very difficult to move powerfully forward

### 3. The Flat Right Foot Technique
- **What to Do:** Keep the sole of the right foot flat on the floor throughout the backswing
- **Benefit:** This allows you to push early, forward, and left (for right-handed players) as you go into the strike
- **Result:** Creates a "super powerful move"

## Understanding the Trade-offs

### Why the Backswing Feels Shorter

Andrew addresses a natural concern: keeping the right foot flat makes the backswing feel shorter. Here's why:

**Limitation in Rotation:**
- With the right foot flat on the floor, you can't rotate as much
- Andrew demonstrates that with his right foot flat, his pelvis reaches its natural limit sooner
- **Important Note:** "Everybody's slightly different" - the exact range will vary by individual

**What Happens When the Right Foot Rolls:**
- Pelvis goes further
- Shoulders go further
- Arms go further
- **Negative Consequences:**
  - Tend to lose control
  - Lose torque (power potential)

### The Spring Analogy

Andrew uses a powerful metaphor: **"We're trying to wind the body up like a spring here"**

- The goal is to create torque (stored energy) by limiting rotation in the lower body
- A flat right foot creates resistance that winds up the body
- This stored energy can then be released powerfully in the downswing

## Technical Demonstration

Andrew provides a slow-motion demonstration showing:

1. **Backswing Phase:** "Right foot stays flat, flat, flat"
2. **Transition:** Once the foot is stable, it becomes easy to:
   - Push forwards and left
   - Get rotating nice and early
   - Generate power
3. **Result:** "Right foot flat on the back swing for a beautiful foundation for the down swing"

## Key Takeaways

1. **Stability Creates Power:** A stable right side (flat right foot) enables powerful movement to the left
2. **Quality Over Quantity:** A shorter, controlled backswing with torque is better than a longer backswing without stability
3. **Common Error Correction:** Most golfers allow the right foot to roll, losing the foundation for power
4. **Individual Variation:** While the principle is universal, the exact range of motion will vary by individual flexibility
5. **Foundation for Downswing:** The flat right foot creates the proper foundation for an explosive, controlled downswing

---

## Practical Application

### To Implement This Tip:
1. During your backswing, focus on keeping the entire sole of your right foot in contact with the ground
2. Accept that your backswing may feel shorter than usual
3. Feel the pressure building in your right foot as you wind up
4. Use that stable platform to push powerfully toward your left side in the downswing
5. Maintain this stability until you begin your forward rotation

### What Success Looks Like:
- Stable right foot throughout backswing
- Sensation of "loading" or pressure in the right side
- Powerful push-off feeling as you transition to downswing
- Better ball striking with a controlled draw shape (as Andrew demonstrates at the end: "There's that baby draw again")

## Summary Statement

Keeping your right foot flat on the floor during the backswing is a fundamental technique that creates stability, generates torque, and provides a powerful foundation for the downswing. While it may limit your backswing length, this trade-off results in more controlled, powerful, and consistent ball striking. This is a correction Andrew makes with students daily, emphasizing its importance for golfers of all levels.
