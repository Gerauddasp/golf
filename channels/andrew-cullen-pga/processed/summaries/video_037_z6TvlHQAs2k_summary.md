## Overview

Andrew Cullen explains the "skater move" technique, a fundamental weight shift motion in the golf swing that helps achieve proper low point control. The video uses Scotty Scheffler's swing as an example of this concept in action.

## Key Concepts

### The Skater Move
- A technical move explained by Andreas (referenced instructor)
- Analogous to ice skating: pushing the back skate into the ground to move forward
- In golf: pushing under the right foot to shift left

### Mechanics
- **Weight Transfer:** Push under the right foot to move left
- **Center Movement:** Center of chest and center of pelvis move forward
- **Timing:** Starts before the backswing is even complete (early weight shift)
- **Result:** Gets the low point in the correct position for ball-first contact

### Scotty Scheffler's Example
- Shows an exaggerated version of the skater move
- Already starting to move left early in the swing
- Has moved significantly left by impact
- Creates "funky footwork" due to:
  - Massive pressure in the left foot (to prevent falling over)
  - Left foot reacts to the pressure
  - Right foot slides forward due to the extreme forward movement

### Disclaimer
- The instructor notes Scheffler's footwork is "not necessarily recommended to do"
- The purpose is to understand the principle of the skater move for pure ball striking

## Demonstration

Andrew demonstrates the technique in slow motion:
1. Backswing begins
2. Before backswing completes, push under right foot to initiate leftward movement
3. Center of chest and pelvis move into powerful striking position
4. Result: Ball-first contact, then ground, with deep divot underneath left shoulder

## Key Takeaway

The skater move is about early weight shift and forward body movement to ensure the low point of the swing arc occurs in front of the ball, resulting in ball-first contact and proper divot location.
