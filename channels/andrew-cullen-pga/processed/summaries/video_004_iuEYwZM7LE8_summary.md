## Overview

This video presents "Drill Number Two" - the **Stomp Drill** - a highly effective training exercise designed to correct one of the most common amateur golf swing faults: hanging back on the ball. Andrew Cullen demonstrates how this drill helps golfers achieve a proper descending blow on the ball by moving the horizontal low point forward.

## Key Concepts

### The Problem: Hanging Back

- **Common Amateur Mistake:** Many amateur golfers, especially with longer irons, have the misguided feeling that they need to "get the ball up in the air"
- **Consequence:** This causes the horizontal low point to move further and further behind the ball
- **Result:** Poor contact, loss of distance, and inconsistent ball striking

### The Solution: The Stomp Drill

The stomp drill addresses this issue by encouraging proper weight transfer and forward movement during the downswing.

## The Drill: Step-by-Step Instructions

### Starting Position
- Set up in normal golf stance with the ball

### Execution (Slow Motion First)
1. **Backswing:** Take your normal backswing
2. **Transition:** As you finish the backswing, lift your left foot off the ground
3. **The Stomp:** Stomp the left foot back down as you begin the downswing
4. **Follow Through:** Complete the swing normally

### Progression
- Start with slow-motion swings to develop coordination
- Progress to practice swings at full speed
- Eventually incorporate into actual shots

### Key Point
- The stomp doesn't necessarily have to be a step forward
- The goal is to **load the left side**
- Loading the left side brings the low point forward

---

## Biomechanical Benefits

### Movement Along the X-Axis
- The drill encourages lateral movement to the left
- This moves the body's center of mass forward relative to the ball
- Results in the low point occurring **after** the ball (proper impact position)

### Force Generation
The stomp drill creates three types of beneficial forces:

1. **Lateral Force** - Movement toward the target
2. **Vertical Force** - Ground reaction forces
3. **Rotational Force** - Proper body rotation through impact

Andrew calls this "one beautiful power move" that combines all three force vectors.

## Technical Details

### The Horizontal Low Point
- **Critical Concept:** The horizontal low point must come **after** the ball
- This is what creates the descending blow necessary for solid iron contact
- The stomp drill specifically targets moving this low point forward

### Sternum Position
- Andrew mentions the sternum position relative to the ball
- As you stomp and move left, the sternum naturally moves forward
- This forward position ensures proper ball-first contact

---

## Benefits of the Drill

1. **Corrects Weight Shift:** Forces proper weight transfer to the lead side
2. **Improves Contact:** Creates the descending blow needed for clean strikes
3. **Increases Power:** Generates additional clubhead speed through proper sequencing
4. **Better Ball Flight:** Achieves optimal launch conditions
5. **More Consistency:** Establishes repeatable impact position

---

## Practice Recommendations

### Initial Practice
- Start with slow-motion rehearsals
- Focus on coordination and timing
- Don't worry about ball striking initially

### Progression
- Move to full-speed practice swings
- Hit balls with the drill (as demonstrated)
- Can even play shots on the course with this technique

### Andrew's Personal Note
Andrew mentions he's planning to "hit lots of shots around the golf course next time with feet together and lots of stompers," indicating he values this drill even at the professional level.

## Target Audience

### Who Benefits Most
- Amateur golfers who hang back on the ball
- Players who struggle with longer irons
- Golfers who "help" the ball into the air
- Anyone with a horizontal low point behind the ball

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Main Problem Addressed:** Hanging back on the ball, especially with longer irons
2. **Primary Fix:** The stomp drill - lifting and stomping the left foot during transition
3. **Core Principle:** Loading the left side moves the low point forward
4. **Result:** Proper descending blow with ball-first contact
5. **Bonus Benefit:** Significant power generation through combined force vectors
6. **Practice Method:** Start slow, build coordination, then incorporate at full speed

## Related Concepts

- **X-Axis Movement:** Lateral shift toward the target
- **Horizontal Low Point:** The forward-most point of the swing arc
- **Descending Blow:** Striking the ball before the ground
- **Weight Transfer:** Proper sequencing from trail to lead side
- **Ground Force Reaction:** Using the ground to generate power

---

## Coaching Tips

### Feel vs. Real
- The "stomp" might feel exaggerated but creates the proper movement pattern
- Don't overthink the forward step - focus on loading the left side
- The drill naturally coordinates the proper sequence

### Common Concerns
- Players might worry about falling forward - this is actually desired
- The move should feel dynamic and athletic
- Initial attempts may feel uncoordinated (normal - persist with slow motion)

---

## Conclusion

The Stomp Drill is a powerful training tool that addresses the fundamental issue of hanging back in the golf swing. By creating an exaggerated weight shift to the lead side, it teaches the proper feeling of moving the low point forward and achieving the descending blow necessary for solid iron play. The drill also has the added benefit of generating significant power through the combination of lateral, vertical, and rotational forces. Whether you're struggling with long irons or simply want to improve your ball striking, this drill provides an effective, feel-based solution that can be practiced anywhere and incorporated into on-course play.
