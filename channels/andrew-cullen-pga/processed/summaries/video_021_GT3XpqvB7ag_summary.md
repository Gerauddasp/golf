## Main Teaching Objective

Andrew Cullen teaches golfers how to create more power and distance through a paradoxical approach: by shortening and optimizing the backswing rather than lengthening it. The lesson is based on the throwing motion principle from Fred Shoemaker's "Extraordinary Golf," providing three simple tips plus a bonus drill to improve backswing and transition mechanics for more powerful, consistent drives.

## Core Philosophy: The Throwing Motion

### Fred Shoemaker's Extraordinary Golf Concept

The foundation of this lesson comes from practicing the actual act of throwing golf clubs early in the morning, which reveals fundamental truths about power generation:

**Key Principles from Throwing:**
1. Start with the club HIGH in the air
2. Club drops DOWN
3. Club swings at 90° to the upper body position
4. This sequence transfers energy through the body to the club head most efficiently and powerfully

### Analogies from Other Sports

**Baseball Swing:**
- Start high
- Drop low
- Swing around the body

**Tennis Forehand Topspin:**
- Racket starts UP (not down)
- Drops down
- Then creates power through body rotation

**Critical Insight:** You would NEVER see someone throw an object as far as they could by starting low and swinging horizontally. The natural throwing motion always involves elevation, drop, and rotation.

### The Right Side Foundation

When preparing to throw:
- Right side BRACES itself
- Right side is STABLE
- This stability allows you to push forward onto the left side
- This is the foundation for all three tips

## Tip #1: "Tee to the Right Pocket"

### The Setup

**Equipment:**
- Insert a golf tee into the grip end of your club

**The Concept:**
- Point the tee toward your right pocket (for right-handed golfers)
- Keep it pointing at the right pocket for AS LONG AS YOU CAN during takeaway

**Source:** David Leadbetter's "A Swing" book

### How It Works

**Phase 1: Takeaway**
1. Normal setup position
2. On takeaway, point tee to right pocket
3. Keep tee pointing to right pocket as long as possible
4. Creates beautiful coordination between club, hands, arms, and body
5. The ENTIRE rib cage must turn on the backswing

**Phase 2: Top of Backswing**
- Eventually right shoulder gets closer to the grip than left shoulder
- Right arm MUST fold
- As it folds, it rotates naturally
- Tee starts to point around to the ball
- Tee stays pointing at the ball as long as you can on the way down

### Why This Creates a "Shorter" Feel

**Creates Naturally Upright Backswing:**
- Not trying to swing upright
- Simply turning the whole rib cage with tee to right pocket
- Happens automatically

**Creates Naturally Flat Downswing:**
- Through transition, the move flattens naturally
- Just by focusing on where the tee is pointing

**Compact Arm Swing:**
- Upper arms stay ATTACHED to upper body
- Arm folds LATE and MORE DOWNWARDS
- Keeps the arm swing nice and compact
- Prevents over-swinging

**Benefits:**
- Flattening helps with arm rotation
- Helps swing club from inside with power
- You might feel it's a slightly shorter arm swing
- BUT you're not TRYING to swing shorter
- You're building WAY BETTER coordination between arm swing and body swing

## Tip #2: Right Foot Flat

### The Principle

From the throwing motion, we learned: to move powerfully LEFT, we need a very STABLE right side.

### The Technique

**Setup:**
- Keep the sole of the right foot FLAT on the floor during the entire backswing

**Benefits:**
1. Right foot is flat and pushing toward the left side
2. Happens BEFORE rotation and release
3. Creates a very stable base
4. Allows you to push early and forward (or left) as you go into strike
5. Super powerful move

### Why It Makes Backswing Feel Short

**Restriction by Design:**
- If right foot is flat on the floor, you CAN'T rotate as much
- For Andrew personally: flat foot = pelvis rotation stops at a certain point
- Everyone is slightly different based on flexibility

**The Problem with Rolling:**
- If right foot ROLLS to the outside during backswing:
  - Pelvis goes further
  - Shoulders go further
  - Arms go further
  - You tend to lose CONTROL
  - You're losing TORQUE

### The Spring Analogy

**What You're Creating:**
- Winding the body up like a SPRING
- Need to keep right foot flat on the floor
- This creates the tension/torque needed for power

**Result:**
- Right foot stays flat, flat, flat
- Now it's easy to push forwards and left
- Get rotating nice and early and powerfully
- Beautiful foundation for the downswing

## Tip #3: Lower Right Leg in Concrete

### The Source

From Jean-Jacques Rivet, David Leadbetter's colleague who co-wrote "The A Swing"

### The Concept

**Visualization:**
- Imagine your lower right leg is set in CONCRETE
- NO MOVEMENT in the lower right leg during backswing

**What Can Move:**
- Upper body turns well
- Pelvis WILL get turned back (that's natural)
- Upper thigh WILL get pulled back behind you (that's natural)

**What Stays Still:**
- Lower right leg from knee down

### The Purpose: Maximum Torque

**Combining Restrictors:**
1. Flat right foot (Tip #2)
2. Lower right leg in concrete (Tip #3)
3. Compact arm swing with tee to right pocket (Tip #1)

**Result:**
- You're TORQUING UP on the backswing
- Creates maximum stored energy
- Enables very powerful movement on the downswing

### The Feel

**During Backswing:**
- Imagine you're up to your knee in concrete
- Body must torque up around this restriction

**During Downswing:**
- All that stored torque releases
- Power through the shot with beautiful body turn on the way down
- Right foot stays stable
- Right lower leg stays in concrete until release

## Bonus Tip: Head Against the Wall Drill

### Equipment Needed

- Your head
- A wall (no expensive training aids required!)

### Andrew's Philosophy

"I'm not a lover of training aids. You got to buy pieces of plastic off Amazon or wherever. We can do all these things on the driving range. Just have to be a little creative."

### The Drill Setup

**Position:**
1. Take your setup WITHOUT the club
2. Stand very CLOSE to the wall with your trail (right) side facing it
3. Your head should be nearly touching or just touching the wall

**The Movement:**
1. Make a full turn thinking of tee to the right pocket
2. You won't see the wall (it's behind you)
3. Try to keep your head from swaying off to the RIGHT hand side

### What It Teaches

**Feeling Maximum Torque:**
- Really FEEL the body torquing up on the backswing
- Head stays in place (can't sway right)
- Body must rotate around a stable head position

**Combined Restrictions:**
- Restriction from flat right foot (Tip #2)
- Restriction from lower right leg in concrete (Tip #3)
- Compact arm swing with tee to right pocket (Tip #1)
- NOW: Head stays stable (no right sway)

**Result:**
- You'll torque up EVEN MORE on the backswing
- Creates maximum coil
- Enables powerfully explosive movement on the downswing
- "Kaboom!"

## Why This Approach Creates More Distance

### The Paradox Explained

**Traditional Thinking:**
- Longer backswing = more distance
- More swing = more power

**Reality:**
1. **Better Coordination** - Tee to right pocket creates perfect sync between arms and body
2. **Maximum Torque** - Restrictions create coiled spring effect
3. **More Control** - Shorter, compact swing is more controllable
4. **Better Sequencing** - Stable right side enables powerful weight transfer
5. **Efficient Energy Transfer** - 90° relationship between club and body (like throwing)

### Common Over-Swing Problems This Fixes

**What Happens with Too-Long Backswing:**
- Right foot rolls, losing stability
- Lower leg moves, losing torque
- Arms disconnect from body
- Loss of control
- Loss of coil/spring tension
- Inefficient energy transfer

**What Happens with These Tips:**
- Compact, controlled backswing
- Maximum torque stored
- Perfect coordination maintained
- Powerful, explosive release
- Better contact
- More consistent strikes
- Greater actual distance despite "shorter" feel

## The Three Tips Summary

### Tip #1: Tee to the Right Pocket
**Goal:** Create upright backswing and flat downswing with compact arm swing
**Feel:** Tee points to right pocket, then to ball, coordination between arms and body
**Benefit:** Better coordination, prevents disconnection, creates powerful inside path

### Tip #2: Right Foot Flat
**Goal:** Create stable base for powerful weight shift
**Feel:** Sole of right foot stays flat on ground during entire backswing
**Benefit:** Early, powerful push to left side, maintains torque, stable foundation

### Tip #3: Lower Right Leg in Concrete
**Goal:** Maximize torque and coil
**Feel:** No movement below the right knee during backswing
**Benefit:** Maximum stored energy, powerful spring effect, explosive downswing

### Bonus: Head Against Wall
**Goal:** Prevent head sway and maximize coil
**Feel:** Head stays in place as body rotates around it
**Benefit:** Even more torque, better rotation quality, prevents lateral movement

## Practice Recommendations

### On the Range

**Phase 1: Understanding (Without Ball)**
1. Practice throwing motion to feel the natural sequence
2. Work on tee-to-right-pocket motion slowly
3. Feel right foot staying flat
4. Feel lower right leg stability
5. Use wall drill at home or range

**Phase 2: Slow Motion (With Club)**
1. Make slow practice swings with all three tips
2. Focus on coordination over speed
3. Feel the torque building
4. Notice how arm swing stays compact

**Phase 3: Full Speed (Hitting Balls)**
1. Pick ONE tip to focus on per session initially
2. Once comfortable, combine tips
3. Trust the process - swing may feel shorter but results will be longer
4. Look for that "baby draw" ball flight

### What to Expect

**Feelings:**
- Backswing may FEEL shorter (it's more compact)
- More restriction/tightness in backswing (that's the torque!)
- More explosive feeling in downswing
- Better balance
- More solid contact

**Results:**
- Straighter ball flight
- Possible draw shape
- Better trajectory
- More distance despite "shorter" swing
- More consistency
- Better control

## Key Concepts and Terminology

**Throwing Motion:** The natural motion of throwing an object for maximum distance, which shares fundamental mechanics with the golf swing

**Tee to Right Pocket:** Drill using a tee in the grip end pointing toward the trail pocket to create proper coordination and compact arm swing

**Torque:** The rotational force created by restricting the lower body while rotating the upper body, like winding a spring

**Flat Foot:** Keeping the sole of the trail (right) foot in contact with the ground during the backswing to create stability

**Lower Leg in Concrete:** Visualization of keeping the trail lower leg completely stable from knee down during backswing

**Compact Arm Swing:** Arm swing that stays connected to body rotation rather than extending independently

**90° Relationship:** The optimal angle between the club and upper body for maximum energy transfer, as seen in throwing motions

**Baby Draw:** A gentle draw ball flight (right to left for right-handed golfer) indicating proper swing path and face relationship

## Equipment Needed

- Driver
- Golf tee (for grip end drill)
- Wall (for bonus head drill)
- Golf balls
- Practice range or area with room for full swings

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Right foot rolling during backswing** - Loses stability and torque
2. **Lower right leg moving during backswing** - Loses coil and power
3. **Arms disconnecting from body** - Leads to over-swing and loss of control
4. **Head swaying to the right** - Reduces torque and affects consistency
5. **Trying to swing longer** - Missing the point; coordination and torque create distance, not length
6. **Focusing on speed over feel initially** - Need to develop proper feels first

## Final Thoughts

Andrew's key message: "You might well feel it's a slightly shorter arm swing, but we're not trying to swing shorter. We're actually building a way better coordination between the arm swing and the body swing."

The lesson emphasizes that power comes from:
- Proper sequencing (like throwing)
- Maximum torque (like a coiled spring)
- Perfect coordination (body and arms working together)
- Stability in the right places (allowing explosive movement in others)

Result: "Powerful fairway finders" with a beautiful baby draw ball flight.
