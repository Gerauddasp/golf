## Overview

Andrew Cullen shares a clever technique for handling difficult downhill putts by intentionally hitting the ball off the toe of the putter rather than the sweet spot to better control speed.

---

## Key Concepts

### The Challenge: Downhill Putts
- Downhill putts are notoriously difficult due to speed control issues
- The ball can come off too "hot" from the putter face on downhill slopes

### The Solution: Toe Contact
**Main Technique:** Hit the ball out of the toe of the putter instead of the sweet spot

**Why This Works:**
- Reduces the energy transfer to the ball
- Creates a "softer" contact
- Allows for better speed control on fast downhill putts

## Technical Breakdown

### Fundamentals Still Apply
1. **Stay Positive:** Maintain positive intent with your stroke
2. **Eye Position:** Look at the front of the ball
3. **Stroke Through:** Make sure to swing through the ball (don't decelerate)

### Toe Strike Technique
1. **Setup:** Address the ball out of the toe of the putter
2. **Stroke:** Make your normal positive putting stroke
3. **Focus:** Still look at the front edge of the ball
4. **Goal:** "Set the wheels in motion" with controlled speed

### In the Demo
- The putt had "a little bit of right to left" break
- Andrew positioned the ball on the toe deliberately
- He made a positive stroke while maintaining speed control
- The putt successfully found the hole

## Key Takeaways

1. **Speed Control is Critical:** On downhill putts, controlling speed is more important than hitting the sweet spot
2. **Intentional Mis-Hit:** Sometimes the "wrong" contact point is the right choice
3. **Keep Fundamentals:** Don't abandon good putting fundamentals (positive stroke, proper eye position)
4. **Balance Power and Touch:** This technique balances the need for a confident stroke with appropriate speed

## Practice Application

**When to Use This Technique:**
- Fast downhill putts
- Slick greens where speed control is paramount
- Situations where you're worried about the ball running too far past

**Setup Tips:**
- Position ball toward toe of putter at address
- Maintain your normal putting setup otherwise
- Trust the technique and make a confident stroke
