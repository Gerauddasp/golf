## Overview

This video is part of a series focusing on unlocking hidden speed in the golf swing. Andrew Cullen discusses the second key principle: **Radius**. The video emphasizes maintaining a consistent distance between the hands and upper body throughout the swing to maximize club head speed and maintain proper connection between the arms and body.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Radius Maximization
- **Core Principle:** Keep the hands at the same distance away from the upper body from start to strike
- **Result:** Maximizes the radius of the club head, which directly maximizes club head speed
- **Simple Focus:** Maintain the "hands to upper body" distance throughout the swing

### 2. Connection Between Arms and Body
- **Upper Arm Connection:** By maintaining radius, the upper arms stay connected to the upper body from start to finish
- **Torque Transfer:** This connection allows the body's torque to effectively transfer through the arms
- **Problem with Disconnection:** When shoulders turn but arms disconnect (as shown in initial videos), it becomes very difficult to get torque working properly from body to arms

### 3. Natural Downward Motion
- **Automatic Motion:** When arms stay wide and maintain radius, they naturally tend to work downwards
- **No Forced Action Needed:** Don't need to consciously pull the club downwards or let it fall
- **Natural Benefits:** This natural motion creates:
  - Significant leverage
  - Rotation in the right arm
  - Lots of speed generation

## Main Teaching Points

1. **Simplicity is Key:** Keep the concept super simple - focus on one distance measurement
2. **Hands to Upper Body:** Repeat this mantra - maintain this distance consistently
3. **Maximize Radius = Maximize Speed:** The physics principle that wider radius equals higher club head speed
4. **Stay Connected:** Upper arms and upper body should work as a connected unit
5. **Let Physics Work:** By maintaining radius, the natural downward motion and leverage happen automatically

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Disconnecting Arms from Body:** Turning shoulders while letting arms swing independently
2. **Collapsing the Radius:** Allowing hands to come closer to the body during the swing
3. **Forcing Downward Motion:** Trying to consciously pull the club down rather than letting radius create natural motion

---

## Practical Application

**Mental Cue:** "Hands to upper body, hands to upper body, hands to upper body"

**What to Feel:**
- Constant distance between hands and torso
- Upper arms staying connected to chest/body
- Width maintained throughout the swing
- Natural downward motion without effort

**Expected Results:**
- Increased club head speed
- Better connection and torque transfer
- More leverage and right arm rotation
- Optimized radius for maximum speed

## Context in Series

This is the **second principle** in the speed series (as indicated by "number two, radius"). Andrew references "initial videos" where he demonstrated shoulder turn with arm swing, suggesting this is part of a progressive teaching sequence building on previous concepts.

## Key Takeaway

**The fundamental message:** Maintaining a consistent radius (hands to upper body distance) throughout the golf swing is a simple yet powerful way to unlock hidden speed. This one thought creates multiple beneficial effects: maximizes club head speed, maintains body-arm connection, enables proper torque transfer, and creates natural leverage - all leading to increased swing speed.
