**Duration:** 65.6 seconds

## Key Topic
Creating power and speed in the golf swing through proper torque mechanics

## Main Teaching Points

### The Old Method vs. The New Method
- **Traditional teaching:** Simply turn your shoulders on the backswing
- **Problem:** This is NOT the most powerful or effective method to create club head speed
- **Better approach:** Rotate the entire rib cage on the backswing

### Sources & Influences
- Andrew learned this improved technique from:
  - Mike Adams
  - Terry Rolls (biomechanist)

### The Correct Technique: Rib Cage Rotation
**Key concept:** Instead of just turning shoulders, rotate the WHOLE rib cage

**Visualization technique:**
- Think of a point in the middle of your rib cage
- Try to stretch that point as far away from the ball as possible on the backswing

### Benefits of Rib Cage Turn vs. Shoulder Turn
1. **More tension in the body** - stores energy for the downswing
2. **More radius in the arm swing** - creates a wider arc
3. **Greater power storage** - allows you to "explode" on the downswing
4. **Increased club head speed**

## Demonstration
Andrew physically demonstrates the difference between:
- Shoulder turn only (limited movement)
- Rib cage turn (significantly larger rotation and radius)

## Bottom Line
Rotating the entire rib cage (not just shoulders) creates more torque, tension, and radius, which translates to more power and club head speed in your golf swing.
