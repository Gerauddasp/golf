## Overview
Andrew Cullen presents three "easy setup wins" to help golfers hit straighter drives by controlling club face angle and club path. The lesson focuses on pre-swing setup adjustments rather than swing mechanics changes, making them quick gains with minimum disruption to technique.

## Key Concepts: Ball Flight Physics

### Club Face Direction
- **The ball will always start where the club face is pointing at strike**
- Open club face (pointing right) = ball starts right
- Square club face (pointing at target) = ball starts at target
- Closed club face (pointing left) = ball starts left

### Club Path
- **Outside-to-in path** = right spin on the ball (slice/fade)
- **Inside-to-out path** = left spin on the ball (draw/hook)
- **The goal:** Deliver club face square and minimize the difference between club face angle and club path to control spin

---

## The Three Easy Setup Wins

### Easy Win #1: Left Hand Grip Position (for right-handed golfers)

**The Problem:** Open club face at impact, ball starting right of target

**The Solution:**
- **Natural grip position:** Let the left hand hang naturally and place the club in the hand (arm naturally turns in, not parallel to body)
- **For slicers - Strong grip position:**
  - Hold the club outside your left hip
  - Let hand hang naturally
  - Place club in hand in this position
  - This creates stronger grip that promotes forearm rotation to close the club face

**What to Avoid:**
- Weak grip position (trying to grip while club is out in front)
- This causes arm to rotate in opposite direction, opening the club face at strike

**Result:** Strong grip helps square the club face and prevents ball starting right

---

### Easy Win #2: Handle Position

**Two dimensions to consider:**

#### A. Vertical Position (Handle Height)

**Higher handle position:**
- Encourages inside-to-out club path
- Puts left spin on ball (draw)
- Reference: "Bryson DeChambeau style"
- Best for slicers

**Lower handle position:**
- Encourages outside-to-in club path
- Puts right spin on ball (fade/slice)
- Avoid if you slice

#### B. Horizontal Position (Handle Forward/Back)

**Neutral position (recommended):**
- Let driver lie naturally on ground
- Shaft sits at 90° to ground
- Hands level with club head

**Forward position (NOT recommended for driver):**
- Reduces loft (can turn 10.5° into 0°)
- Encourages draw spin
- Good for irons, not driver

**Back position (AVOID for slicers):**
- Hands behind club head
- Encourages out-to-in swing path
- Adds right spin (makes slice worse)

**Worst setup for slicers:** Weak grip + low and back handle position = "hit it right, right, right all day"

---

### Easy Win #3: Forearm Alignment

**Neutral position:**
- Shoulders, feet, hips, and forearms all pointing at target
- Forearms level with each other

**Right forearm below left forearm:**
- Encourages in-to-out swing path
- Creates draw spin, left spin on ball
- Good for slicers

**Right forearm above left forearm:**
- Encourages outside-to-in swing path
- Creates cut/fade spin on ball
- Good for hookers

---

## Application Guide

### For Slicers (Ball Going Right)
**Combine all three adjustments:**
1. **Strong grip position** (club outside left hip)
2. **Handle up** (higher position, not back)
3. **Right forearm below left forearm**

**Result:** Eliminates slice, promotes straight or slight draw

---

### For Hookers (Ball Going Left)
**Reverse the adjustments:**
1. **Neutral to weak grip position**
2. **Handle slightly low** (but keep neutral horizontally to maintain loft)
3. **Right forearm above left forearm**

**Result:** Reduces hook, promotes straight or slight fade

---

### For Controlled Shot Shaping
**Don't need all three adjustments - use 1 or 2:**

**For controlled draw:**
- Choose 1-2 adjustments from the slicer fixes
- Employing 2 = more draw spin
- Employing 1 = less draw spin (baby draw)

**For controlled fade:**
- Choose 1-2 adjustments from the hooker fixes
- Similar principle for controlling amount of fade

## Demonstrations & Results

### Demo 1: Strong Grip (addressing slice)
- Setup: Strong grip position, slight adjustments
- Target: Avoid water on right
- **Result:** "Left side of the fairway. Woo."

### Demo 2: Draw Setup
- Setup: Slightly strong grip + hands high (DeChambeau style) + neutral horizontal
- **Result:** "Started a little bit left of target and moved a little bit further left, but it's still a fairway finder"

### Demo 3: Combined Slicer Adjustments
- Setup: Strong grip + handle up + right forearm below left
- Aim: At bunker to play hook back
- **Result:** "Started just on the bunker and is now moving well left on the fairway"

### Demo 4: Hooker Adjustments
- Setup: Neutral grip + handle low + right forearm above left
- Aim: Left side of fairway
- **Result:** "Started just left side of the fairway. Now he's coming back. It's going to be just right side of the fairway"

### Demo 5: Baby Draw
- Setup: Neutral grip + neutral handle + right forearm under left
- **Result:** "Yes, there he is. Absolutely beautiful"

### Demo 6: "DeChambeau Baby Draw"
- Setup: Hands high
- **Result:** "Started on the bunker, little bit left"

## Key Teaching Points

1. **Minimum disruption, maximum gains:** These are setup adjustments, not swing changes
2. **Physics-based:** Adjustments work with natural anatomy and swing physics
3. **Stackable adjustments:** Can combine multiple adjustments for bigger effect or use individually for subtle changes
4. **Start with grip:** If you have open club face problems, left hand grip position is "first port of call"
5. **Customizable:** Adjust based on your specific ball flight issues

## Summary Quote
"So really the goal of all these easy wins is to deliver the club face back to square and to try and minimize the difference between the club path and where the club face is pointing to minimize the spin on the ball. Baby fade, baby draw, very controllable."

## Target Audience
- Golfers who struggle with:
  - Missing fairways
  - Slicing driver
  - Inconsistent ball flight
  - Hook problems
- Golfers wanting to learn controlled shot shaping

---

## Difficulty Level
**Beginner to Intermediate** - These are fundamental setup adjustments that can be implemented immediately without changing swing mechanics.
