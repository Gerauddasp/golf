## Overview

Andrew Cullen presents three unconventional exercises to help golfers achieve what he calls the "angel angle" - a 90-degree relationship between the shaft and spine angle just before delivery. This position maximizes energy transfer through the body and arms into the clubhead and is present even in some of the most unorthodox swings on tour (Jim Furyk, Fred Couples, John Daly).

## The Three Tricks

### 1. No Right Hand Exercise

**Concept:** Open the right hand during the backswing to train proper arm positioning.

**How to do it:**
- Take normal setup position
- Open the right hand (release grip)
- Make a full backswing with the right hand only slightly pressuring against the grip
- This trains the right arm to bend late and rotate late

**Key Benefits:**
- Right elbow points down naturally
- Right elbow gets at least level with (or below) the left arm
- Delivers the club at 90° to the ball
- When returning to normal grip, "switch off" the right hand to achieve the angel angle more naturally

### 2. The Radius Tip

**Concept:** Maintain consistent distance between hands and chest throughout the swing.

**Key Insight:**
Despite having different backswing positions (steep like Furyk, flying elbow like Couples, or extreme like Daly), all great players maintain radius to achieve the angel angle.

**How to do it:**
- Maintain the radius (distance) between your hands and chest going up to the top
- **Critically maintain this radius as you start down**
- Keep hands away from your body in the transition zone
- The club drops down into the angel angle naturally
- Right elbow folds naturally down underneath the left arm

**Common Mistake to Avoid:**
Don't try to force the right arm close to the body. It's about maintaining space (radius) to allow the right arm to fold down properly.

### 3. No Lobsters (Grip Pressure)

**Concept:** Release tension in the index finger and thumb of the right hand.

**The Problem:**
The "lobster grip" - hanging on for dear life with the index finger and thumb of the right hand - can destroy the angel angle even with perfect takeaway and radius, causing:
- Outside-in path
- Chunks
- Slices
- Pulls

**How to do it:**
- Normal setup
- "Take the lobster off" - open/release the index finger and thumb of the right hand
- Practice swings without the ball first
- Progress to hitting balls with this modified grip
- Because you can't physically push the club with those two fingers, the club folds down into the angel angle naturally

**Bonus Benefit:**
You'll get more lag and leverage on the downswing.

## Key Takeaways

1. The "angel angle" (90° shaft-to-spine relationship) is critical for maximizing energy transfer
2. This position is achievable regardless of your backswing style
3. Reducing right-hand dominance helps achieve proper delivery position
4. Maintaining radius (hand-to-chest distance) is crucial through transition
5. Excessive grip pressure, especially in the right thumb and index finger, can sabotage good mechanics

---

## Practice Progression

1. Start with the "no right hand" exercise to feel proper arm positioning
2. Add the radius concept - focus on keeping hands away from body in transition
3. Incorporate the "no lobsters" grip pressure release
4. Practice each drill without a ball first
5. Progress to hitting shots while maintaining these feels

## Note for Left-Handed Golfers

Andrew acknowledges lefties (4% of the golfing population but "a very important 4%") should simply reverse all right/left hand references in these exercises.
