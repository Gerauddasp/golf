## Key Putting Tips

### Tip #1: Keep Your Booty Still
- **Main Point:** Maintain lower body stability throughout the putting stroke
- **Benefit:** More reliable swing path and better directional control
- **Key Principle:** If the butt stays still from start to strike, the ball goes where you aim

### Tip #2: Balance a Coin on Your Neck
- **Problem Addressed:** Looking up too early on short putts
- **Solution:** Balance a two-pence piece (or similar coin) on the back of your neck
- **Focus Point:** Keep the point on the back of your neck still from start to strike
- **Benefit:** Prevents head movement, maintains consistent swing path, reduces pulls and pushes

### Tip #3: Keep Your Forearms Soft
- **Problem Addressed:** Poor distance control and lack of feel
- **Solution:** Focus on soft forearms rather than grip pressure
- **Source:** Learned from Brad Faxon in Florida
- **Benefit:** Better pendulum motion, improved feedback and feel, better distance control

### Tip #4: Putt from Your Sternum
- **Problem Addressed:** Robotic shoulder rocking that causes head waggle
- **Concept:** Small sternum movement creates larger shoulder movement
- **Benefit:** Simple, natural stroke without forcing shoulder rotation
- **Key:** Stay connected with arms while letting sternum drive the motion

### Tip #5: Clock Face Visualization for Breaking Putts
- **Technique:** Imagine the hole as a clock face
- **Examples:**
  - Straight putt: ball enters at 6:00
  - Right to left: ball enters at 4:00
  - Left to right: ball enters at 7:00, 8:00, or 9:00
- **Process:**
  1. Read the putt
  2. Pick a start line
  3. Visualize the ball dropping at the appropriate "time"
  4. Execute with that picture in mind

### Tip #6: Avoid the Disaster Setup Position
- **Critical Rule:** NEVER have your eyes beyond the ball (outside the target line)
- **How to Check:** Drop a ball from your left eye (for right-handers)
  - Acceptable: Eyes over the ball or slightly inside
  - Disaster: Eyes beyond/outside the ball
- **Why:** Eyes beyond the ball creates an outside-in path requiring constant compensation
- **Ideal:** Eyes over or slightly inside allows natural inside-square-inside path

### Tip #7: Alternative Grip for the Yips
- **Problem Addressed:** Uncontrollable right-hand movement causing yips
- **Solution:** Place right hand on the wrong side of the grip
- **Source:** Learned from Mike Kanski (coach of Wyndham Clark)
- **Benefit:** Beautiful pendulum motion without right hand getting too active
- **For:** Players who've tried everything else (claw grips, etc.)

### Tip #8: Don't Decelerate - Look at the Front of the Ball
- **Problem Addressed:** Deceleration on delicate downhill putts
- **Solution:** Focus eyes on the front of the ball (not the back)
- **Psychology:** Fools the brain into thinking the strike point is further ahead
- **Result:** More positive, accelerating stroke that maintains club face alignment
- **Application:** Especially useful on downhill breaking putts

### Tip #9: Develop Feel Through Feedback Exercise
- **Drill:** Hit putts without looking, then guess the result
- **Process:**
  1. Hit the putt
  2. Don't look at the result
  3. Ask yourself: too short, right distance, or long?
  4. Then look to verify
- **Benefit:** Rapidly develops sense of feel and distance control
- **Variation:** Practice from different distances

### Tip #10: Around the Clock Drill (Most Important)
- **Andrew's Note:** "If you ignore all other 99 tips, don't ignore this one"
- **Setup:** Four ball positions at 1 meter from the hole:
  1. Straight uphill (confidence builder)
  2. Right to left breaking
  3. Straight downhill
  4. Left to right breaking
- **Training Aid:** Lay the flag on the ground to check:
  - Club face square at address
  - Swing path (inside-square-inside vs outside-in)
  - Consistency of stroke
- **Challenge:** Make 17 out of 20 putts before finishing
- **Protocol:** Go around the clock 5 times (20 total putts)
- **Key:** Use the same routine every time (like on the course)
- **Impact:** Andrew claims this drill has "changed people's handicaps"

## Practice Philosophy

### Routine Consistency
- Go through the same pre-shot routine on every putt
- Make practice as close to on-course conditions as possible

### Progressive Difficulty
- Start with confidence-building straight putts
- Progress to breaking putts from different angles
- Practice all types of breaks, not just your favorites

### Measurable Standards
- Set specific goals (e.g., 17 out of 20 makes)
- Hold yourself accountable to standards before moving on
