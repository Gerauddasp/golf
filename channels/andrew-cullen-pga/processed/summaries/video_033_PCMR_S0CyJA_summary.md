## Overview

This short instructional video addresses a common grip mistake Andrew Cullen calls the "lobster grip" - gripping too tightly with the index finger and thumb of the right hand (for right-handed golfers). He demonstrates a simple exercise to correct this issue and improve swing mechanics.

## Key Concepts

### The Lobster Grip Problem
- **What it is:** Gripping too tightly with the index finger and thumb of the right hand
- **Why it's a problem:** Even with a good takeaway and radius, excessive tension in these two fingers causes:
  - Loss of proper "angel angle" (club shaft angle)
  - Throwing the club from the outside
  - Results in chunks, slices, and pulls

### The Solution: "Switch the Lobster Off"
- Release the grip pressure in the index finger and thumb of the right hand
- Open these two fingers during the swing

---

## The Exercise

### Without a Ball:
1. Set up in normal address position
2. "Take the lobster off" - open/release the index finger and thumb of the right hand
3. Make a swing through transition
4. Without the ability to push with those two fingers, the club naturally:
   - Folds down into the proper "angel angle"
   - Right elbow folds to level with or underneath the left arm
   - Creates proper delivery position

### With a Ball:
- Same process as above
- Demonstrates that the technique works in actual shot execution
- Results in better lag and leverage through the downswing

---

## Benefits

1. **Proper club position:** The club naturally falls into the correct "angel angle" during transition
2. **Better elbow position:** Right elbow folds properly (level or underneath left arm)
3. **Increased lag:** More lag and leverage on the downswing
4. **Improved delivery position:** Sets up for better ball striking

## Technical Notes

- This is the third tip in what appears to be a series (he mentions "Number three")
- The concept is related to his "angel angle" teaching - a specific shaft position/angle during the downswing
- Acknowledges left-handed golfers (4% of the golfing population) should reverse the instruction

## Practical Application

**Drill:** Practice swings and actual shots with the index finger and thumb of the trail hand (right for righties) opened or loosened. This removes the ability to push the club incorrectly and allows natural mechanics to take over, promoting proper sequencing and club position through transition and into delivery.
