**Duration:** 48.88 seconds

## Key Concept
Achieving proper ball-then-divot contact by controlling lateral movement during the backswing.

## Main Teaching Points

### 1. Avoid Excessive Rightward Movement
- The primary mistake is moving too far right during the backswing
- This makes it difficult to return the center of chest and center of pelvis back to the ball at impact

### 2. Use the Right Thigh Bone as the Swing Axis
- Imagine the right thigh bone as the axis of rotation for the backswing
- This prevents shifting off to the right side
- Maintaining this axis makes the downswing much easier

### 3. Proper Impact Position
- Goal: Get the center of chest and center of pelvis level with or ahead of the ball at impact
- This positioning ensures ball-first contact followed by divot

### 4. Training Aid Usage
- Andrew uses a stick placed against the right foot
- This physical reminder helps avoid excessive lateral movement to the right

## Core Principle
By restricting lateral movement during the backswing and maintaining your center over the ball, you create the proper conditions for forward shaft lean and ball-first contact, resulting in the desired ball-then-divot strike pattern.

## Target Audience
Golfers struggling with:
- Fat or thin shots
- Inconsistent contact
- Reverse pivot patterns
- Understanding proper weight shift vs. lateral sway
