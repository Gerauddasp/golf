## Overview
Andrew Cullen explains two key differences between weak and powerful driver swings: creating torque with the body on the backswing and maintaining radius in the arm and club head throughout the swing. Both elements contribute to increased club head speed and distance.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Creating Torque (Not Just Shoulder Turn)
- **Old teaching:** "Turn your shoulders, laddy" - taught in Scotland
- **New understanding:** Rotate the whole rib cage, not just shoulders
- **Influence:** Learned from Mike Adams and Terry Rolls (biomechanics experts)
- **How to do it:** Think of a point in the middle of your rib cage and stretch it as far away from the ball as possible
- **Benefits:**
  - Creates more tension in the body
  - Increases radius in the arm swing
  - Stores up power to explode on the downswing

### 2. Maintaining Radius
- **Key principle:** Keep hands the same distance away from the body from start to strike
- **Benefits:**
  - Maximizes the radius of the club head
  - Maximizes speed in the club head
  - Keeps upper arms connected to upper body throughout
  - Creates natural downward motion without forcing it
  - Generates leverage and rotation in the right arm

### 3. Connection vs. Disconnection
- When just turning shoulders and swinging arms independently, you disconnect
- Disconnection makes it difficult to transfer torque from body to arms
- Wide arms naturally work downwards when maintaining radius
- No need to pull the club down - it happens naturally with proper radius

## Real-World Evidence
- Three 70-year-old clients (Leo, Christine, and Verer) with relatively good mobility all gained distance using these techniques
- Demonstrates that age is not necessarily a barrier to implementation

## Practice Approach
Andrew suggests focusing on one element at a time:
1. First shot: Focus on torque - stretching midpoint of rib cage away from ball
2. Second shot: Focus on radius - keeping hands same distance from upper body
3. Both shots demonstrated as "fairway finders"

## Bonus Tip: Red Cross Drill
- Draw a big red cross on the golf ball
- Rotate the cross so it's turned towards you slightly and down a bit (not square on the tee)
- Try to hit the red cross with the club head
- **Purpose:** Encourages an inside and upward attack angle with the club head
- **Benefit:** Helps achieve optimal launch angle off the tee

## Key Thought Patterns
1. **For torque:** "Stretch the midpoint of my rib cage away from the ball"
2. **For radius:** "Hands to upper body, hands to upper body, hands to upper body"
3. **For launch:** "Red cross, red cross, red cross" (visual focus)

## Practical Takeaway
Men can typically only think of one thing at a time during the swing, so practice each element separately before combining them. The focus should be on feeling the torque or maintaining the radius, not on mechanical positions.
