## Overview

This is Andrew Cullen's third golf tip in a series, focusing on a backswing technique inspired by Jean-Jacques Rivet's work (co-author of "The A Swing"). The tip emphasizes keeping the right lower leg stable and immobile during the backswing to create torque and generate more power in the golf swing.

## Key Concept

**"Right Lower Leg in Concrete"**

The central teaching point is to imagine your right lower leg (from the knee down) being set in concrete during the backswing. This creates a restriction that:
- Prevents excessive lateral movement
- Builds torque in the body
- Creates a powerful coil effect
- Enables a more explosive downswing

---

## Technical Breakdown

### Backswing Mechanics

1. **Lower Right Leg Position**
   - Keep the lower right leg completely stable (no movement)
   - Imagine it's encased in concrete up to the knee
   - This acts as a "restrictor" to build tension

2. **Upper Body Rotation**
   - Turn the upper body fully against this stable base
   - The pelvis will naturally turn back
   - The upper right thigh will get pulled back behind you
   - This creates a powerful coiling effect

3. **Foot Position**
   - Keep the right foot flat on the ground (mentioned as a previous tip)
   - Combined with the stable lower leg, this creates maximum restriction

### The Result

- **Torquing Effect:** The stable lower leg combined with upper body rotation creates significant torque
- **Power Generation:** This stored energy translates to a more powerful downswing
- **Body Turn:** Enables a "beautiful body turn" through impact

## Instruction Sequence

Andrew Cullen demonstrates the concept while hitting shots:

1. Sets up with focus on keeping the right foot stable
2. Emphasizes the lower right leg staying in concrete during backswing
3. Allows upper body to turn fully while maintaining lower leg stability
4. Powers through the downswing with the stored energy

---

## Key Teaching Points

### What to Do:
- Imagine your lower right leg (below the knee) is set in concrete
- Keep the right foot flat on the ground
- Turn your upper body fully during the backswing
- Allow the pelvis and upper thigh to rotate naturally
- Power through with a full body turn on the downswing

### What to Avoid:
- Moving or shifting the lower right leg during backswing
- Allowing the right foot to roll or lift
- Excessive lateral movement away from the ball

---

## Context & Attribution

- This is identified as "tip number three" in a series
- The concept is attributed to Jean-Jacques Rivet's teaching colleague
- Rivet co-wrote "The A Swing" golf instruction book
- The tip builds on previous concepts (mentions "flat foot" as an earlier tip)
- It's part of a system using "restrictors" to build power

---

## Practical Application

**Drill:**
Imagine or visualize that your right lower leg is encased in concrete from the ground up to just below the knee. Make practice swings while:
1. Keeping this area completely stable
2. Turning your upper body as much as possible
3. Feeling the tension and torque build up
4. Releasing through impact with a full body turn

**Feel:**
You should feel a stretching or coiling sensation in your right hip and core area as you reach the top of the backswing, with all the tension stored in the stable right side ready to release powerfully through the ball.

---

## Summary

This tip provides a simple but powerful mental image—the right lower leg "in concrete"—to help golfers create the proper restriction and torque needed for a powerful golf swing. By preventing movement in the lower right leg while allowing full upper body rotation, golfers can store energy more efficiently and release it explosively through impact. This technique is part of a broader swing system that uses strategic restrictions to maximize power and consistency.
