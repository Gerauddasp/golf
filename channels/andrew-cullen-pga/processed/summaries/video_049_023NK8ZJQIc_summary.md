## Overview

Andrew Cullen demonstrates the "Texas wedge" technique - a solution for one of putting's most awkward situations: when the ball is lying against the fringe, making clean contact with a putter difficult.

## The Problem

When a ball is positioned against the fringe, it's very difficult to get clean contact with the putter head. The risk is getting too much grass between the club face and the ball, leading to poor results.

## The Solution: Texas Wedge Technique

### Key Concept
Instead of using a putter, use a pitching wedge (or 9-iron) and hit it like a putt.

### Why It Works
1. **Better Visibility**: With a pitching wedge, you can see the bottom edge of the club, making it easier to identify where to make contact
2. **Similar Length**: The pitching wedge is not much longer than a putter, maintaining familiarity
3. **Cleaner Contact**: Easier to hit the ball on the equator or just above the equator to "top it" intentionally

### Execution Steps

1. **Read the putt** like you normally would (identify break, speed, etc.)
2. **Grip the pitching wedge** like you would hold a putter
3. **Use normal putting swing mechanics**
4. **Focus on contact point**: Hit the ball on the equator or just above the equator
5. **Minimize grass interference**: Aim to get no grass between the leading edge of the club and the ball
6. **Adjust for conditions**: Consider the height of grass behind the ball

### Contact Point
The key is to intentionally "top" the ball by hitting it on the equator or just above the equator, rather than trying to strike it in the middle as you would with a normal putt.

## Advantages

- Much easier than trying to chip the ball in this situation
- Avoids the danger of getting grass between the club face and ball when using a putter
- Produces a nice roll with the ability to read and play break
- More consistent results in awkward lie situations

## Result Demonstration

Andrew demonstrates the technique and produces a near-gimme putt with good roll and the intended right-to-left break.

## Key Takeaways

1. When your ball is against the fringe, consider the Texas wedge instead of a putter
2. Use a pitching wedge or 9-iron for optimal results
3. Grip and swing like a putt, but focus on hitting the equator of the ball
4. Follow normal putting procedure for reading and executing the shot
5. This technique is more reliable than attempting to chip or putt from this awkward position
