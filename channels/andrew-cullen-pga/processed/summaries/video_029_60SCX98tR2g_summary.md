## Overview

In this video, Andrew Cullen challenges conventional golf grip instruction by presenting three personalized tips for finding the optimal left-hand grip position for right-handed golfers. Based on 35 years of teaching experience, he emphasizes that there's no one-size-fits-all approach and encourages golfers to find what works naturally for their individual body mechanics rather than strictly following textbook guidelines.

## Key Concepts

### Main Theme
The video focuses on customizing your left-hand grip position to match your natural arm rotation and body mechanics, rather than adhering to traditional textbook methods like "two knuckles showing, V to the right shoulder."

### Core Philosophy
- Not everyone is the same - what works for tour pros may not work for you
- Natural arm rotation determines optimal grip position
- The left forearm wants to return to its natural starting position
- This natural rotation directly affects clubface position at impact

---

## Three Main Tips

### Tip 1: Finding Your Natural Left Hand Position

**The Method:**
1. Stand straight up
2. Let your arms hang naturally by your sides
3. Notice that hands don't hang parallel to the body - they naturally turn inward
4. Place the club on the ground, aimed at your target
5. Wrap your fingers around the grip exactly how your hand naturally hangs

**Key Insights:**
- Your natural hand position could show anywhere from 2 to 4 knuckles
- Examples from tour: Matthew Fitzpatrick and Dustin Johnson use super strong grips (4 knuckles), Bernard Langer did the same
- The grip position affects arm rotation, which delivers the clubface back to square (or not)

**Why It Matters:**
- **Weak grip (unnatural):** Arm rotates clockwise coming into strike to return to natural position, opening the clubface, requiring compensations
- **Too strong grip (unnatural):** Arm over-rotates, closes the clubface, starts ball left
- **Natural grip:** Arm returns naturally to starting position, delivering clubface square

### Tip 2: Short Thumb vs. Long Thumb Position

**Neither is wrong - each has specific advantages:**

#### Short Thumb Position
**Recommended for:**
- Players who overswing
- Players with tendinitis, tennis elbow, or golfer's elbow
- Those seeking more control

**Benefits:**
- Helps support the club at the top of the swing
- Weight and momentum of club spread over both arms
- Less pressure on the left arm
- More control of the swing
- Better control of clubface up to the top of backswing
- Better direction control
- Prevents club from going too far back

**Andrew's Personal Choice:** Short thumb

---

#### Long Thumb Position
**Recommended for:**
- Players seeking more distance
- Those who need more clubhead speed

**Benefits:**
- Creates more leverage at the top of the swing
- More wrist angle at the top
- Creates more leverage in both arms
- Helps generate more speed on the downswing

**Cautions:**
- Risk of losing wrist control
- Can open clubface if you go too far
- May require compensations on the way down
- Only recommended when distance is a significant problem

---

### Tip 3: Grip Pressure

**The Scale (1-5):**
- **1:** Almost as loose as possible (club might fly out of hands)
- **3:** General recommended pressure (MOST COMMON RECOMMENDATION)
- **5:** Hanging on as tight as possible (Bryson DeChambeau's approach)

**General Recommendation: Pressure Level 3**
- Maintains consistent pressure from start to finish
- Allows natural rotation and leverage from both arms
- Left arm returns to natural position
- Clubface delivered square
- Results in more fairways and greens hit

**Goal:** Keep the same grip pressure from start to strike

---

#### Advanced Variation: Different Pressure for Each Hand

**Example: Left Hand 4, Right Hand 2**

**Benefits:**
- Can help if right hand is hitting too hard
- Allows better release
- Softening the right hand can create more powerful position at strike
- More leverage and compression on the ball
- Prevents right hand from releasing too early
- Referenced Shane Lowry whose little finger isn't even on the grip during swing

**Andrew's Personal Choice:** Left hand 4, right hand 2

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Personalization Over Textbook:** Don't strictly follow traditional grip instruction - find what's natural for YOUR body

2. **Natural Position Test:** Let your arms hang naturally and grip the club in that position to find your starting point

3. **Thumb Length Decision:**
   - Control problems or injury concerns = Short thumb
   - Distance problems = Long thumb

4. **Grip Pressure Consistency:** Maintain the same grip pressure throughout the entire swing

5. **Experiment:** Try different combinations to find what produces the best ball strike and direction control on average

6. **Professional Examples:** Tour pros use vastly different grips (Fitzpatrick and Johnson with 4 knuckles vs. traditional 2 knuckles), proving there's no single correct approach

---

## Andrew's Personal Setup

- **Grip Style:** Natural position found by letting arm hang
- **Thumb Position:** Short thumb
- **Grip Pressure:** Left hand 4, right hand 2
- **Consistency:** Same grip for every full swing regardless of club

---

## Expected Results

By finding your natural grip position and maintaining consistent grip pressure:
- Hit more fairways
- Hit more greens
- Find the middle of the clubface more often
- Better control of clubface throughout swing
- Natural sequencing and flow in the swing
- Reduced need for compensations
