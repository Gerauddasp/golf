## Overview

This instructional video teaches golfers how to find their ideal posture and distance from the ball using a simple, personalized method taught by biomechanist Mike Adams. The technique emphasizes maintaining natural body alignment while adapting to different club lengths.

## Key Teaching Points

### The Core Principle
- **Individual Differences**: Everyone is built differently, so posture needs to be personalized
- **Natural Posture**: You don't need to dramatically change your normal upright posture
- **Consistency**: Same posture position applies across all clubs (driver, irons, wedges)

### Natural Standing Posture Elements
1. **Spine Alignment**: Head and spine in a natural S-curve line
2. **Shoulder Position**: Shoulders wide
3. **Knee Flex**: Slight bend in knees (not straight/locked legs)
4. **Comfort**: Position should feel natural and comfortable

### The Mike Adams Posture Test

**Step-by-Step Method:**
1. Stand straight up with good posture
2. Place hands on your thighs
3. Sit back slightly (hinge from the hip joint)
4. Slide hands down your legs until your longest finger touches the top of your kneecap
5. You'll feel tension in your glutes/posterior chain
6. Let arms hang down naturally
7. This creates the correct distance from the ball

**Key Insight:** This same posture position works for all clubs - the club length determines ball distance, not posture changes.

## Practical Demonstrations

### Pitching Wedge Setup
- Closer to the ball (due to shorter club)
- Same posture position maintained
- Arms hang naturally

### Six Iron Setup
- Farther from ball than wedge (longer club)
- Identical posture position to wedge
- Same body angles maintained

### Driver Setup
- Farthest from ball (longest club)
- Still using the exact same posture position
- Finger-to-kneecap test ensures consistency

## Key Takeaways

1. **Personalization**: The finger-to-kneecap method accounts for individual body proportions
2. **Simplicity**: One consistent posture approach for all clubs eliminates complexity
3. **Athletic Position**: The resulting stance is described as "perfect, athletic, and ready to rumble"
4. **Natural Movement**: Maintains your body's natural alignment rather than forcing artificial positions
5. **Reliability**: Provides a repeatable reference point (kneecap) for consistent setup

## Expert Reference

- **Mike Adams** - Credited as "biomechanist extraordinaire" who developed this method
- This technique is grounded in biomechanical principles rather than arbitrary positioning

---

## Benefits of This Approach

- **Eliminates guesswork** about stance width and ball position
- **Reduces setup variables** - same posture for all shots
- **More repeatable** - physical reference point (finger to kneecap)
- **Athletic and natural** - works with your body's natural structure
- **Suitable for all body types** - self-adjusting method

---

## Practice Tips (Implied)

1. Start by identifying your natural upright posture
2. Practice the finger-to-kneecap slide movement
3. Feel the tension in the posterior chain (glutes/hamstrings)
4. Check this position with different clubs to build consistency
5. Use this as your pre-shot routine foundation
