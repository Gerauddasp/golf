## Overview

Andrew Cullen demonstrates two simple drills using a golf tee to help golfers achieve the proper delivery position with the right elbow pointing down towards the ground. This position is crucial for transmitting body energy to the club head, creating leverage, rotation, and speed while maintaining directional control.

## Key Concepts

### The Importance of Right Elbow Position

**Why the Right Elbow Must Point Down in Delivery Position:**
- Connects the arms to the body
- Transmits energy from the body to the club head
- Creates leverage and rotation in the right arm
- Generates speed and directional control
- Used by all the best players throughout history, regardless of backswing position

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Forcing Elbows Together
**The Problem:**
- Many amateurs think they need to keep elbows together from start to strike
- Pushing elbows together can bring the shoulder joint forward
- Creates unnatural movements that open golfers up to injury
- Can isolate the shoulder joint and put too much stress on it
- Not necessary (referenced Scottie Scheffler who doesn't do this)

**Injury Risks from Unnatural Positions:**
- Shoulder joint stress from isolation
- Tennis elbow or golfer's elbow from gripping too tight with the left hand
- Back problems from overdoing side bend
- Right arm injuries from unnatural starting positions

### Mistake #2: Tucking Right Elbow into Right Pocket
**The Problem:**
- Reduces the radius in the swing
- Reducing radius reduces club head speed
- Creates an inefficient delivery position

## Drill #1: Tee in Grip (Right Pocket to Ball)

### Setup:
- Insert a golf tee into the end of the club grip
- Focus on where the tee is pointing throughout the swing

### Execution:
1. **Takeaway:** Point the tee to your right pocket for as long as possible
2. **Transition:** As the right arm folds and rotates, the tee will flip
3. **Delivery:** The tee points to the ball (or just outside, depending on the club)

### Benefits:
- Creates clear mental picture of proper arm movement
- Delivers speed and energy from body to club head
- Maintains connection between arms and body
- Generates leverage and rotation in the right arm

### Reference:
- Andrew shows Lynn Grant's swing as an example of this movement pattern

## Drill #2: Tee in Glove (Pointing Skyward)

### Setup:
- Open your glove
- Insert a golf tee where the Velcro overlaps
- Tee should point upward from the back of the left hand
- Alternative: Use your watch face if you don't wear a glove

### Execution:
1. **Backswing:** Whether you have a flying right elbow (Freddy Couples) or elbow behind you (Scottie Scheffler), focus on the left hand position
2. **Top of Swing:** Get the tee (or watch) pointing skyward
3. **Transition:** Maintain the upward pointing direction
4. **Delivery:** This skyward pointing naturally causes the right arm to fold down into proper delivery position

### Mental Approach:
- "If we get the picture, we can get the feel"
- "If we can get the feel, we can do the movement"
- Visualize the tee pointing up in the air through transition

---

## Technical Insights

### Steep Swing Problems:
- Amateur golfers with steep swings often have problems with the left arm
- Loading goes onto the left arm when the swing comes down steep
- Flattening the swing distributes weight over both arms
- Creates a much better delivery position

### Weight Distribution:
- Proper delivery position distributes force across both arms
- Reduces stress on individual joints
- Creates more sustainable, injury-free swing mechanics

---

## Key Teaching Points

### Flexibility in Backswing Positions:
- Elbows together can work IF shoulders don't move forward
- Flying right elbow (like Freddy Couples) is acceptable
- Elbow behind you (like Scottie Scheffler) is acceptable
- The critical element is the DELIVERY POSITION, not the backswing position

### The Universal Goal:
"Whatever you are, flying right elbow or elbows together without the shoulders together, we want to get this position of the left hand up up up and then we're in beautiful delivery."

---

## Practical Application

### Practice Progression:
1. Start with Drill #1 to understand the right arm movement pattern
2. Progress to Drill #2 to coordinate both arms
3. Focus on the mental picture of tee pointing skyward through transition
4. Let the proper delivery position happen naturally from correct setup

### Equipment Needed:
- Standard golf tee (the "very expensive training aid")
- Golf glove (optional for Drill #2)
- Any club (works for irons and driver)

## Andrew's Philosophy

### Health-First Approach:
- Worked with osteopaths and physiotherapists throughout career
- Very aware of potential golfing injuries
- Emphasizes building "powerful, efficient, and healthy swing"
- Warns against unnatural movements and positions

### Mental Imagery:
- Emphasizes "playing with pictures in your head"
- Picture → Feel → Movement progression
- Clear visual cues make complex movements simple

---

## Summary

These two tee drills provide simple, visual, and natural ways to achieve the world-class delivery position without forcing unnatural movements or risking injury. The key is understanding that the delivery position (right elbow pointing down) is what matters, not maintaining rigid elbow positions throughout the entire swing. By focusing on mental imagery—tee pointing to right pocket then flipping to ball, and left hand tee pointing skyward—golfers can naturally find their optimal delivery position regardless of their backswing style.
