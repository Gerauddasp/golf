## Main Teaching Objective

Andrew Cullen teaches golfers how to eliminate the driver slice by addressing the 6 most common causes he sees daily - 2 in the setup position and 4 during the swing. The goal is to narrow the angle between club face and club path to reduce side spin and create straighter drives or even draw spin.

## Understanding The Three Types of Slices

Before diving into solutions, Andrew explains the ball flight physics:

### Straight Shot (Reference)
- Club face and club path pointing exactly the same direction
- Ball starts straight and stays straight
- No spin on the ball

### Slice Type 1: Ball Starts Left, Then Slices Right
- Club face pointing left of target
- Swing path even MORE left than the club face
- Creates right spin on the ball

### Slice Type 2: Ball Starts Straight, Then Slices Right
- Club face pointing down the target line at strike
- Club path to the left of where club face is pointing
- Ball starts straight, then moves right

### Slice Type 3: "Disaster Slice" - Ball Starts Right, Slices Further Right
- Club face pointing right of target line at strike
- Path still to the left of where club face is pointing
- Ball starts right and curves even more right

**KEY CONCEPT:** In all cases, narrowing the angle between club face and club path reduces slice spin.

## Solution 1: Left Hand Grip Position (SETUP)

### Why It Matters
The left hand grip position influences arm rotation, which directly affects club face position at impact.

### How To Fix It

**Finding Your Natural Grip:**
1. Let your left arm hang naturally at your side
2. Place the club into your left hand while arm is hanging
3. This natural position gives you the best chance of returning the club face square at impact

**If Club Face Is Still Open (Stronger Grip Method):**
1. Use the "Adam Scott style" approach
2. Position the club OUTSIDE your left hip
3. Make your grip from this position
4. Keep the arm hanging naturally
5. This creates stronger left arm rotation
6. Delivers club face closed or square to target line (not open)

**What To Avoid:**
- WEAK grip - causes counter-rotation of left arm and opens the club face
- This weak grip leads to the "disaster slice" (Type 3)

---

## Solution 2: Handle Position at Setup (SETUP)

### The Problem
Handle position behind the club head and LOW encourages a swing path to the LEFT, creating slice spin.

### The Fix
1. Position handle LEVEL with the club head (not behind, not ahead)
2. Don't get handle ahead with driver - removes loft from the face
3. Keep hands in neutral or HIGH position
4. This encourages the opposite swing path (to the right)
5. Promotes draw spin instead of slice spin

---

## Solution 3: Backswing Rotation (SWING)

### The Problem
Andrew calls this the NUMBER ONE swing problem with slicers. Golfers:
- Get good grip and setup
- Then swing with only shoulders and arms on backswing
- Don't create space to swing club path to the right
- Almost always swing club path off to the left
- Creates slice spin

### The Solution: "Rib Stretch Thought"

**The One-Thought Move:**
1. Pick a rib on your RIGHT side
2. On the backswing, stretch this rib as FAR AWAY from the ball as possible
3. Keep arms passive - let them swing WITH the body rotation

**Multiple Benefits of This One Thought:**
- Automatically creates proper upper torso rotation
- Pulls the pelvis into proper turn (don't need to think about it)
- Pulls weight shift to the right (don't need to think about it)
- Creates the SPACE needed to swing path to the right
- Enables draw spin on the ball

**Result:** One brilliant thought that fixes multiple issues and creates space for an inside-out swing path.

## Solution 4: No "Lobster Fingers" - Relax Right Hand (SWING)

### The Problem
Holding on for "dear life" with your right hand, specifically the index finger and thumb (the "lobster"). Even with:
- Great setup position
- Great rotation

If the lobster is "switched on," the right hand throws too early, moving club path LEFT at strike.

### The Solution

**Right Hand Pressure:**
1. Keep right hand RELAXED (especially index finger and thumb)
2. Make right hand SOFTER than the left hand
3. Experiment with how soft you can keep it

**Benefits:**
- Stops early throwing motion
- Preserves the space created by rotation
- Creates LAG (speed element)
- Encourages swing path out to the right
- Produces beautiful baby draw

**Key Principle:** Soft right hand = maintained rotation space = right-side swing path = draw spin

## Solution 5: Proper Sequencing (SWING)

### The Problem
Trying to TURN too early from the top of the backswing:
- Throws right shoulder forward
- Gets club path moving left
- Causes slice

### Understanding Sequencing Through Javelin Throw Analogy

**Throwing Motion Sequence:**
1. Run up
2. Plant weight onto left side
3. Push into ground (creates rotation and vertical force)
4. Upper body rotation follows
5. Arm releases last

**Golf Swing Has SAME Sequence:**
1. From top of backswing: move LEFT (weight shift)
2. Push into the ground (vertical force and rotation)
3. Behind all that: shoulders rotate
4. Finally: hands, arms, and club release

### How To Apply It

**Option 1: Right Shoulder Thought**
- Keep right shoulder BEHIND you in transition
- Don't let right shoulder come in FRONT of you

**Option 2: Left Arm Thought (Justin Rose Tip)**
- Keep left arm BEHIND your shoulder level as you swing down
- Don't let it get in front

**Result:** Both thoughts change club path to swing to the RIGHT, converting slice to beautiful baby draw.

## Solution 6: Posture Control - Avoid Early Extension (SWING)

### The Problem
Particularly common with better players. "Early extension" means:
- Losing your posture before coming into strike
- Pelvis moving CLOSER to the ball
- Even a swing that looks good from the inside...
- Pelvis moves forward and swing path moves LEFT
- Creates slice spin

### The Solution

**Setup For Practice:**
1. Use a stick/alignment rod in the ground as reference point
2. Position it where your pelvis should stay during the swing

**Awareness Drill:**
- Make slow motion swings
- Stay in contact with the stick throughout the swing
- Feel what it's like to maintain posture
- Notice how club path moves out to the right when posture is maintained

**Thought 1: Right Pocket Stays Back**
1. Right pocket doesn't go AT the ball
2. Right pocket stays where it is through transition and into impact
3. LEFT pocket/hip moves BACK to the right hip
4. This maintains proper posture angle

**Thought 2: Belt Buckle Distance**
1. Keep belt buckle the SAME DISTANCE from the ball throughout downswing
2. Don't let belt buckle move toward the ball
3. Don't let it move upward
4. Maintains your spine angle and posture

**Result:** Proper posture control = club path stays to the right = draw spin

## Practice Recommendations

Andrew emphasizes that you can work on:
- Just ONE of these elements
- TWO of these elements
- Or ALL SIX of these elements

With practice on any combination, you'll get your slice sorted out.

---

## Equipment Needed

- Driver
- Golf ball
- Alignment stick or similar rod (for posture control drill - Solution 6)
- Practice area with room to make full swings

---

## Common Mistakes Addressed

1. **Weak left hand grip** - Opens club face at impact
2. **Handle too far behind and low at setup** - Encourages left swing path
3. **Arms-only backswing with no torso rotation** - No space for right-side path
4. **Death grip with right hand** - Causes early release and left path
5. **Turning shoulders too early from the top** - Throws right shoulder forward
6. **Early extension (losing posture)** - Pelvis moves toward ball, path goes left

---

## Key Terminology

- **Club Path:** Direction the club is traveling at impact
- **Club Face:** Direction the club face is pointing at impact
- **Draw Spin:** Ball curves gently from right to left (for right-handed golfer)
- **Slice Spin:** Ball curves from left to right (for right-handed golfer)
- **Early Extension:** Losing spine angle by moving pelvis toward ball before impact
- **Sequencing:** Proper order of body movements in the downswing
- **Lobster Fingers:** Gripping too tightly with right thumb and index finger
- **Natural Grip:** Grip formed when arm hangs naturally, allowing natural rotation
- **Stronger Grip:** Left hand more on top/right side of grip to promote closure

---

## Summary of All Six Solutions

1. **Left Hand Grip** - Natural or stronger (never weak)
2. **Handle Position** - Level with club head, hands neutral or high
3. **Backswing Rotation** - Stretch right rib away from ball
4. **Soft Right Hand** - No lobster fingers, keep it relaxed
5. **Proper Sequencing** - Left shoulder/arm stays back, or right shoulder stays behind
6. **Posture Control** - Right pocket stays back, belt buckle maintains distance

All solutions work toward the same goal: narrowing the gap between club face angle and club path direction to eliminate slice spin and create straighter drives or draws.
