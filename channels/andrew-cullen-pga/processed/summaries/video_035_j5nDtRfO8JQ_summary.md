## Overview
Andrew Cullen presents "Bonus Tip #2" - a drill designed to help golfers strike the ball pure by focusing on proper low point placement and trusting their instincts.

## Key Teaching Points

### The Drill Setup
- Place a broken tee (or similar small object) 4-5 cm ahead of the golf ball
- This creates a visual target forward of the ball position

### Execution Technique
- **Eye Focus:** Keep eyes on the tee (not the ball) from start to strike
- **Goal:** Hit and remove the tee, collecting the ball on the way through
- **Mental Approach:** Trust your instinct to hit the forward target

### Purpose
- Instinctively trains proper low point placement (ahead of the ball)
- Promotes forward shaft lean at impact
- Encourages ball-first contact followed by proper divot
- Helps golfers achieve pure, compressed strikes

## Key Takeaway
By focusing on a target ahead of the ball rather than the ball itself, golfers naturally create the correct swing dynamics for pure contact, with the low point occurring in the right place (after the ball).
