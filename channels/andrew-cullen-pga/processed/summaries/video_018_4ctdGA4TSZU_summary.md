## Overview

This video focuses on the critical fundamental of standing the correct distance from the golf ball, which Andrew identifies as essential for successful shots. He emphasizes that this fundamental comes down to two key elements: **posture** and **balance**. The video provides a systematic three-step approach to establish proper setup for every club in the bag.

## Key Concepts

### The #1 Fundamental
- Standing the right distance from the ball can make or break shot success
- Applies to every club in the bag
- Built on two core components: **Posture** and **Balance**

---

## Three-Step System

### STEP 1: Finding Your Proper Posture

**The Mike Adams Method** (Biomechanist)
- You don't need to change much from your normal upright posture
- Key principle: Maintain natural spine alignment while orientating down to the ball

**The Setup Test:**
1. Stand straight up with hands on thighs
2. Sit back and bend from the hip joint
3. Slide hands down until longest finger touches top of kneecap
4. Feel tension in glutes
5. Let arms hang down naturally
6. This posture works for ALL clubs (wedge, iron, driver)

**Key Points:**
- Head and spine remain in natural S-curve alignment
- Shoulders stay wide
- Maintain slight knee flex (not straight legs)
- Same posture position regardless of club
- Club length determines distance from ball, not posture change

**Demonstration:**
- Pitching wedge: Closer to ball, same posture
- 6-iron: Further from ball, same posture
- Driver: Even further from ball, same posture

### STEP 2: Three Reference Points to Check Distance

**Reference Point #1: Longest Finger Position**
- Longest finger should touch TOP of kneecap (not middle)
- **Too low:** Middle of kneecap - difficult to make turning motion
- **Too upright:** Above kneecap - difficult to get club to ball naturally, causes overuse of hands/arms
- **Just right:** Top of kneecap - optimal athletic position

**Reference Point #2: Coin Test (For Irons)**
- Use a coin (pound coin, 10p, 5 franc piece, loonie, etc.)
- Proper setup: Coin should slide about 1/3 of the way under the club head
- The toe of the club should be slightly off the ground
- **Too upright:** Club lies flat on ground
- **Too low:** Coin slides halfway along club head
- **Note:** This reference point is difficult for hybrids and woods

**Reference Point #3: Right Hand Check (Butch Harmon Tip)**
- Take right hand off grip after setup
- Hand should hang naturally opposite the grip
- **Too far away:** Hand hangs away from grip
- **Too close:** Hand hangs inside of grip
- **Just right:** Hand hangs opposite the grip

---

### STEP 3: Balance Point (Pressure Distribution)

**The Critical Balance Element**
- Can have perfect posture but poor balance will destroy the swing
- Body never wants to fall over - it will always react to maintain balance
- These reactions change your distance from the ball during the swing

**Weight Too Far Forward (In Toes):**
- **Problem:** Body stands up during swing
- **Result:** Different distance from ball at impact
- **Consequence:** Difficult to hit cleanly on the way down

**Weight Too Far Back (In Heels):**
- **Problem:** Body moves forward during swing
- **Result:** Getting closer to ball
- **Consequence:** Risk of chunking shots

**Proper Balance:**
- Feel pressure underneath the **balls of your feet**
- Pressure should be under the **front of your shoelaces**
- This allows body to remain stable throughout swing
- No need to react to maintain balance

**Center of Gravity Control:**
- Focus on point behind belt buckle (center of mass)
- Keep this point stable from start to strike
- **Visualization:** Imagine a glass of primitivo wine in middle of stomach
- **Goal:** Don't spill a drop while swinging

**Benefits of Proper Balance:**
- Easy to maintain posture from start to strike
- Body not under threat of losing balance
- Maintains consistent distance to ball throughout swing
- Allows for athletic, controlled motion

## Quick Reference Summary

### The Complete Setup Process:
1. **Find Posture:** Hands on thighs, sit back, longest finger to top of kneecap
2. **Check Position:**
   - Finger at top of kneecap
   - Coin slides 1/3 under iron
   - Right hand hangs opposite grip
3. **Set Balance:** Weight under balls of feet, pressure at front of shoelaces
4. **Maintain:** Keep center of gravity stable (belt buckle point)

### Common Mistakes:
- Changing posture for different clubs (don't do this)
- Weight too far into toes (causes standing up)
- Weight too far into heels (causes moving forward/chunking)
- Longest finger at middle of kneecap (too low)
- Longest finger above kneecap (too upright)

## Target Audience

- Golfers struggling with inconsistent ball striking
- Players who feel uncomfortable at address
- Anyone experiencing balance issues during swing
- Golfers who thin or chunk shots frequently
- Players looking to establish fundamentally sound setup

---

## Teaching Philosophy

Andrew Cullen emphasizes that:
- Everyone is built differently - the system adapts to individual body types
- Posture doesn't change club-to-club, only distance from ball changes
- Balance is just as important as posture
- Small setup errors multiply during the dynamic swing motion
- Proper fundamentals create the foundation for athletic motion

## Key Takeaways

1. **Same posture for all clubs** - let club length determine distance
2. **Three checkpoint system** ensures proper setup every time
3. **Balance is equally important** as posture for consistent ball striking
4. **Body will react to poor balance** - setup determines swing success
5. **Simple reference points** make it easy to check yourself on the course

## Practical Application

### On the Range:
- Practice the posture test with different clubs
- Use a coin to check iron setup
- Verify right hand position
- Feel weight distribution under balls of feet
- Repeat until it becomes natural

### On the Course:
- Quick finger-to-kneecap check
- Feel pressure points in feet
- Maintain center of gravity stability
- Trust the fundamentals
