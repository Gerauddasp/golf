## Overview
Andrew Cullen's 18th putting tip introduces a unique "thumbs grip" technique taught to him by biomechanist Jean Jacque (David Leadbetter's colleague). This grip promotes better ball roll and improved left-right coordination in the putting stroke.

## Key Points

### Main Concept
- **Thumbs grip technique** - A specialized putting grip where the joints of both thumbs fit together on the putter grip
- **Taught by biomechanist** - This technique was shared by Jean Jacque, described as David Leadbetter's mate and a biomechanist extraordinaire
- **Creates beautiful ball roll** - The grip produces a smooth roll that makes the ball appear to stick to the grass

### Technical Details
- **Thumb joint connection** - Fit the joints of your thumbs together into a natural arc on the putter grip
- **Relaxed hand position** - The hands/fingers wrap around the back of the grip naturally, without specific positioning requirements
- **Left-right coordination** - The thumbs-together position enhances coordination and rhythm between both sides of the body
- **Putt from the sternum** - As mentioned in previous tips, the putting motion originates from the sternum

### Benefits
- **Superior ball roll** - Creates a smooth, true roll without the ball jumping
- **No "jumpy" roll** - Eliminates erratic bouncing as the ball comes off the putter face
- **Better coordination** - Improves the synchronization between left and right sides during the stroke
- **Natural rhythm** - The thumb connection promotes a more rhythmic putting stroke

### When to Use
- Ideal for golfers struggling with grip positions
- Helpful for those uncertain about proper hand placement on the putter
- Good alternative for players experiencing inconsistent ball roll

## Demonstration
Andrew demonstrates the grip on a left-to-right putt on a slight downhill slope, showing how the ball rolls smoothly without jumping.
