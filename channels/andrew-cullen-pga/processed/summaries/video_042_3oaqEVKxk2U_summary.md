**Series:** Putting tip number 25 of 100

## Key Concept

The "Dennis Wise" drill - a simple putting practice technique to build confidence on 5-foot putts using just a tee as a target.

## Drill Setup

1. Find a straight 5-foot putt
2. Place a tee in the ground at the edge of the hole (where you want the ball to roll over)
3. No training aids needed - just a simple tee

## Technique

- **Primary Focus:** Roll the ball over the pink tee (not the hole itself)
- **Mental Approach:**
  - Look at the tee when looking up at the hole
  - Keep a mental picture of the tee while swinging back and through
- **Benefit:** Focusing on a small, specific target helps narrow your focus zone

## Results Demonstrated

Andrew made 2 out of 3 putts in the demonstration, showing how this focused approach helps build confidence even when you miss one.

## Why It Works

By concentrating on hitting a very small target (the tee), you:
- Create a more precise focus zone
- Reduce the psychological pressure of the hole
- Still make putts even when slightly off target
- Build confidence on those "nasty little 5-footers"

## Key Takeaway

Narrowing your focus to a specific, small target (the tee) rather than the entire hole makes 5-foot putts feel more manageable and helps improve consistency and confidence.
