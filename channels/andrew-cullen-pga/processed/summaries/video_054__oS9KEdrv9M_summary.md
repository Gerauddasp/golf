## Key Topic
Eye alignment in short putting and how improper head movement affects putt accuracy.

---

## Main Points

### The Correct Setup
- Align three key elements: **club head**, **body**, and **eyes**
- Eyes should be parallel to the target line
- Look along the target line, not across it
- Proper eye alignment leads to a good swing path and accurate ball direction

### Common Mistake
- Golfers often align club face and body correctly but make an error with eye alignment
- The mistake: **tilting the head** to look at the hole instead of **turning the head**
- When you tilt your head, your eyes go offline

### The Problem with Head Tilting
- The club head tends to swing in the same direction as the eye line
- If eyes are offline due to head tilt, the putt will pull off to the left
- This causes missed short putts despite proper club and body alignment

### The Solution
- **Turn your head** to look at the target (correct)
- **Don't tilt your head** to look at the target (incorrect)
- Keep eyes aligned parallel to the target line throughout setup
- Think: "Eyes online" = ball goes in the right direction

## Practical Application
When setting up for short putts:
1. Line up club head
2. Line up body
3. Ensure eyes are also lined up parallel to target line
4. Turn (don't tilt) your head to check the hole
5. Execute the putt with proper eye alignment maintained

## Key Takeaway
All three alignment elements matter: club head, body, AND eyes. Missing any one of these—especially eye alignment—can cause you to miss short putts you should make.
