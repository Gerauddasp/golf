## Key Topic
Technique for getting the pace right when putting from the fringe

## Main Concept
Always putt from the fringe rather than chip or pitch - "worst putt is always better than worst chip"

## The Technique (Phil Mickelson Tip)

### Visual Sequence:
1. Set up with normal putting routine
2. Instead of looking "hole-ball-hole-ball"
3. Use this sequence: **Fringe edge → Hole → Ball → Go**
4. Repeat: Look at where the fringe meets the green, then the hole, then back to the ball

### Why It Works
- Feeds the subconscious mind the critical information it needs
- Accounts for the extra resistance from fringe grass vs. green grass
- Helps calibrate the proper pace automatically

## Demonstration
Andrew demonstrates the technique on a putt with slight right-to-left break:
1. Aims up for the break
2. Follows the eye sequence: edge of fringe → hole → ball
3. Repeats once more before executing
4. Successfully demonstrates the proper pace

## Credit
Tip learned from a Phil Mickelson video from years ago

## Key Takeaway
By consciously looking at the fringe edge before putting, you give your subconscious mind the information it needs to adjust for the different resistance levels between fringe and green, resulting in better pace control.
