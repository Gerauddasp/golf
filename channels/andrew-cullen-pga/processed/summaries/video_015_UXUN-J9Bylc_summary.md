## Overview

Andrew Cullen introduces a revolutionary approach to the downswing based on natural throwing motions found in sports like javelin and baseball pitching. He argues that most golfers are leaving at least 20 yards on the table by misunderstanding how to properly use ground force and weight transfer. The video focuses on two critical steps: "glide phase" and "push" to create maximum power and clubhead speed.

## Key Concepts

### The Throwing Motion Analogy

**Core Principle:** The golf swing should mimic the natural throwing motion our bodies instinctively know.

- **Javelin Example:** Run up, plant front foot, push back, creates rotation and braking, speed comes from upper body and arm swing
- **Baseball Pitcher:** Big step forward, push ground for rotation and braking, momentum from upper body and arm swing
- **Golf Application:** Same elements but from a static position with a small ball on the ground

**Essential Elements:**
1. Plant weight on left side (for right-handed golfers)
2. Push into the ground to create rotation and braking
3. Braking helps momentum of upper body and arms create speed

## The Two-Step Downswing System

### Step 1: Glide Phase

**What It Is:**
- The movement of weight toward the target BEFORE the backswing is complete
- Happens between halfway/3/4 back and the start of the downswing
- Weight begins shifting forward while upper body is still completing the backswing

**Key Teaching Points:**
- **Right pocket moves toward target** before top of backswing is complete
- Credit to Andreas Ki for this teaching concept
- Learned from an Australian pro (name forgotten)

**Common Mistake Addressed:**
- **Ben Hogan Misinterpretation:** Many golfers (including Andrew himself for years) wrongly try to TURN from the top of the backswing before weight is planted on front foot
- This leads to:
  - Loss of power
  - Steep swing
  - Outside-in path
  - Early extension

**What Hogan Actually Did:**
- Was already on his left side BEFORE rotation came
- Weight transfer happened first, then rotation

**Visual Cue:**
- Using a stick on the ground by right hip
- Shows right hip moving off the stick toward target before backswing completes
- Like Scotty Scheffler: well ahead of ball at impact

**Benefits of Glide Phase:**
- Solves myriad of problems
- **Prevents Early Extension:**
  - By getting weight on left side and pushing ground, pelvis goes back rather than toward ball
  - Belt buckle to ball distance stays constant or increases
  - No early extension issues

### Step 2: Push

**What It Is:**
- After gliding and planting weight on left side, push hard into the ground with front foot
- Uses equal and opposite forces from physics

**The Physics:**
- Harder you push down = more power/energy you get back
- Energy translates into:
  - Rotational energy in the hips
  - Upward force
- Both create more speed in upper body, arms, and clubhead

**Natural Compensation:**
- Body doesn't want to fall over
- If you've glided properly, body will naturally react by pushing into ground to save balance
- Forces come somewhat naturally, but can be enhanced

**Scotty Scheffler Example:**
- Jumps because pushing so hard into ground
- Common with long drive champions
- Can be emulated for more power

**Execution:**
- Once weight is planted on left side, just push
- Everything else falls into place
- "Glide and push" repeated for emphasis

## Common Faults Corrected

### 1. Turning Too Early
- **Problem:** Trying to rotate hips from top of backswing before weight shift
- **Result:** Steep, outside-in, loss of power
- **Solution:** Glide phase - shift weight first, then rotate

### 2. Early Extension
- **Problem:** Pelvis moves toward ball during downswing (what Andrew suffered from most of his career)
- **Great players who dealt with it:** Jack Nicklaus, Johnny Miller
- **Difficulty:** Very hard to repeat, not consistently powerful
- **Solution:** Glide phase + push keeps pelvis same distance or moving away from ball

### 3. Misunderstanding Ben Hogan's Teachings
- **Common misinterpretation:** Start rotation immediately from top
- **Reality:** Hogan shifted weight to left side before rotating
- **Key insight:** Downswing starts before backswing is complete (glide phase)

---

## Technical Details

### Timing
- **Glide Phase Starts:** Between halfway to 3/4 of backswing
- **Weight Shift:** Already happening before backswing completion
- **Sequence:** Glide → Plant → Push → Rotation and speed

### Body Positions
- **Backswing Top:** Right pocket begins moving toward target
- **Transition:** Weight planted on left side
- **Downswing:** Push into ground with left foot
- **Impact:** Well ahead of ball (Scotty Scheffler style)

### Ground Force Mechanics
- Plant creates stable base
- Push creates equal and opposite reaction
- Reaction energy becomes rotation and upward force
- Upper body, arms, and club lag behind and accelerate

## Practice Tips

### Slow Motion Work
- Practice glide phase in slow motion first
- Feel right pocket moving toward target
- Notice weight shift happening before backswing completes

### Stick Drill
- Place stick on ground by outside of right foot/hip
- Feel right hip moving off stick before top of backswing
- Demonstrates proper weight shift timing

### Down-the-Line View
- Watch belt buckle to ball distance
- Should stay constant or increase
- Prevents early extension

### Feel Work
- Think "throwing" the club at the ball
- Like javelin thrower or baseball pitcher
- Natural athletic motion from static position

## Key Takeaways

1. **Golf swing is a throwing motion** adapted to a static position with small target
2. **Glide phase is critical:** Weight shifts toward target BEFORE backswing completes
3. **Push creates power:** Hard push into ground with front foot generates speed
4. **Sequence matters:** Glide → Plant → Push → Rotation (not turn from the top)
5. **Prevents common faults:** Eliminates early extension and steep/outside path
6. **Natural but trainable:** Body wants to do this instinctively, but needs proper sequence
7. **Can add 20+ yards:** Proper ground force usage dramatically increases distance

## Instructor Background Notes

- Andrew Cullen was a chronic early extender throughout most of his playing career
- Struggled with turning too early from top of backswing for many years
- Credits Andreas Ki for teaching the "right pocket toward target" concept
- Learned "glide phase" terminology from an Australian pro (acknowledges forgetting name)

## Summary

This video presents a fundamental shift in how to think about the downswing. Rather than initiating rotation from the top of the backswing, Andrew teaches a two-step process: (1) Glide Phase - shifting weight toward the target before the backswing completes, and (2) Push - driving hard into the ground with the front foot to create rotational energy and upward force. This sequence mimics natural throwing motions and eliminates common faults like early extension and steep swings. The result is significantly more clubhead speed and distance - potentially 20+ yards that most golfers are currently leaving on the table.
