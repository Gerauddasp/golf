## Overview
This short video demonstrates the "towel drill" - a practical training technique using a simple golf towel to help golfers find the proper low point in their swing and improve ball contact.

## Key Teaching Points

### The Towel Drill Setup
- Place a towel on the ground
- Position the golf ball approximately one club head's width away from the towel
- The towel acts as a visual/physical barrier

### The Goal
- Miss the towel completely
- Make clean contact with the ball
- This forces proper swing mechanics

### Technical Focus
The drill encourages:
- **Center of pelvis** to be further forward at impact
- **Center of chest** to be further forward at strike
- Proper weight shift and body positioning through the hitting zone

## Benefits
- Helps golfers instinctively find the correct low point in their swing
- Provides immediate feedback (hitting the towel = incorrect technique)
- Simple, equipment-free training aid that can be practiced anywhere
- Promotes better ball-first contact

## Context
This appears to be part of a series, as Andrew mentions "three tips" promised earlier, with this towel drill being tip number one.
