**Title:** Powerful Putting Tip - Get Connected!
**Series:** Putting Tip #26 of 100

## Overview
Andrew Cullen demonstrates the importance of maintaining connection between your arms and body during putting for consistency and maximum feedback from the strike.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Connection in Putting
- **What it means:** Keeping your arms connected to your body during the putting stroke
- **Why it matters:** Provides consistent stroke mechanics and better feedback from impact
- **Result:** Better control of club face, swing path, pace, distance, and accuracy

### 2. Grip Position for Connection
**Connected Grip (Recommended):**
- Left hand sitting a little underneath the grip
- Right hand sitting a little underneath the grip
- Thumbs positioned together
- Hands positioned more toward each other rather than on top of the club

**Disconnected Grip (To Avoid):**
- Hands positioned more on top of the grip
- Arms hanging too loose from the body
- Hands facing more down to the left/right
- Creates less control and feedback

### 3. Benefits of Connection
- **Better swing path control:** Easier to keep the putter on the correct path
- **Maximum feedback:** Feel the strike quality more clearly
- **Improved pace/distance control:** Better sense of how hard to hit the ball
- **Keeps ball online:** More consistent direction and accuracy
- **Less club face rotation:** More stable putter face throughout the stroke

### 4. Problems with Disconnection
- Less feedback from the strike
- Club face more likely to "waggle all over the place"
- Reduced control of club face
- Inconsistent results
- Arms hanging too loose from body

## Practical Application
Andrew demonstrates this concept on a challenging left-to-right downhill putt, showing:
1. **Connected version:** Better feedback and control (made the putt)
2. **Disconnected version:** Less feedback and control (still decent, but not optimal)

## Key Takeaway
Get your arms connected to your body by positioning your hands underneath the grip with thumbs together. This creates better feedback, control, and consistency in your putting stroke.
