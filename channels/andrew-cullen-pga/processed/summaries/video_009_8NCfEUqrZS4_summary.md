## Overview
This short video teaches a simple mental trick to help golfers make better contact with the ball by shifting their focus from hitting the ball to hitting a specific point on the ground. Andrew introduces the "tee drill" - a practice technique he frequently uses with students to reduce anxiety and improve ball striking consistency.

## Key Concepts

### The Physics of Ball Flight
- The ball is on the ground and needs the leading edge of the club to hit underneath the equator of the ball
- When you hit the sweet spot with loft, the ball will fly properly
- The low point of the club head swing needs to be at or just after the ball position

### The Mental Challenge
- If you focus on the top of the ball, your subconscious will try to hit the top of the ball
- This creates a high likelihood of topping the shot
- Looking at the ball creates stress and anxiety about getting it up in the air, hitting it straight, etc.

### The Solution: Focus on Low Point
- Change the task from "hitting the ball" to "hitting the low point"
- This creates a less stressful objective
- You're not trying to get the ball up, send it straight, or even hit it at all
- You're simply trying to hit the correct low point

## The Tee Drill Technique

### Setup
1. Get a small tee
2. Place the tee in front of the ball (at the intended low point)
3. Look at the tee from start to finish of your swing

### Benefits
- Reduces anxiety and stress
- Simplifies the task to just making contact with the tee
- Removes the pressure of directing the ball or getting it airborne
- Most successful method Andrew uses with customers on the golf course
- Helps transfer your practice swing quality to your actual ball swing

### Mental Focus
- Look at and focus on the tee from start to strike
- Don't try to direct the ball or lift it
- Just focus on making contact with the tee
- The ball flight will take care of itself

## Coaching Philosophy

Andrew emphasizes that this drill:
- Has been featured many times on his channel
- Is the easiest way to get your practice swing to match your ball swing
- Has proven the most successful with his students on the course
- Works by simplifying the task and reducing mental pressure

## Practical Application

### When to Use This Drill
- During practice sessions to develop proper low point control
- On the course when feeling anxious about ball contact
- When struggling with topped shots
- When your practice swing feels better than your actual swing

### Expected Outcome
By focusing on the tee (low point) instead of the ball:
- Better club path and strike
- More consistent contact
- Reduced topping
- Less anxiety during the swing
- Natural ball flight without forced manipulation

## Key Takeaways

1. **Physics First:** Understand that proper contact requires hitting just after the ball (low point)
2. **Mental Shift:** Focus on the low point, not the ball itself
3. **Simplify the Task:** Make it about hitting the tee, not controlling ball flight
4. **Reduce Stress:** Remove the pressure of multiple objectives (height, direction, contact)
5. **Trust the Process:** Let the club's loft and proper contact create the ball flight naturally

## Training Notes

This is a fundamental drill that addresses:
- **Technical Issue:** Low point control
- **Mental Issue:** Performance anxiety and over-focus on results
- **Common Problem:** Topping the ball
- **Solution Type:** Task simplification and focus redirection

The drill is particularly effective because it gives the golfer something concrete and simple to focus on, rather than worrying about multiple outcomes simultaneously.
