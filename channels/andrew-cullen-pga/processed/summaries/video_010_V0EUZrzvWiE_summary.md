## Overview
Andrew Cullen demonstrates a simple yet effective technique for improving golf swing sequencing by keeping the jaw and upper body relaxed, inspired by Scotty Scheffler's approach.

---

## Key Concepts

### The Relaxed Upper Body Technique
- **Core Principle**: Keeping the upper body soft and hands soft allows natural sequencing in the golf swing
- **The Jaw Connection**: A relaxed jaw leads to relaxed shoulders, hands, and arms
- **Inspiration**: Technique is modeled after Scotty Scheffler's swing mechanics

### Implementation Method
- **Mouth Position**: Keep mouth slightly open (no clenching of teeth)
- **No Tension**: Avoid any tension in the jaw area
- **Bonus Tip**: Smiling also helps maintain relaxation

---

## Technical Benefits

### Improved Sequencing
- The relaxed upper body allows for more natural swing sequencing
- Creates a better "throwing motion" in the golf swing
- Eliminates the need to consciously think about sequencing
- Upper body softness translates to proper kinetic chain activation

### Biomechanical Advantages
- **Shoulders**: More freedom of movement
- **Hands**: Better feel and control
- **Arms**: Reduced tension allows for smoother swing path
- **Overall**: More fluid and athletic motion

## Demonstration Structure
1. **Full View Shot**: Shows complete swing with relaxed jaw technique
2. **Close-Up Face Shot**: Focuses on the facial expression and jaw position to highlight the "Scotty Scheffler game face"
3. **Execution**: Demonstrates how the technique produces a "beautiful sequence in the throwing motion"

---

## Practical Application

### Pre-Swing Setup
- Check jaw tension before taking stance
- Allow mouth to be slightly open
- Consider adding a slight smile for additional relaxation

### During Swing
- Maintain jaw relaxation throughout the entire motion
- Let the softness cascade from jaw → shoulders → arms → hands
- Trust the natural sequencing that results

---

## Professional Reference
**Scotty Scheffler Connection**: The video references Scotty Scheffler's notable swing characteristic of keeping his mouth slightly open during his swing, which helps him maintain upper body softness and achieve excellent swing sequencing.

---

## Key Takeaway
By focusing on one simple element (a relaxed jaw with mouth slightly open), golfers can create a chain reaction of relaxation throughout the upper body, leading to better swing sequencing without having to consciously think about complex mechanical movements. This is a practical, easy-to-implement tip that can immediately improve swing fluidity and consistency.
