## Main Teaching Objective

This video focuses on optimizing your driver setup position from the knees down to unlock maximum body rotation and hit longer, straighter drives. Andrew emphasizes that if your foot position and knee position are incorrect at setup, everything above the knee will be fighting to recover, leading to compensations and loss of power. The core principle is that proper lower body setup provides access to the golf swing's most powerful movement: body rotation.

## Key Biomechanics Principle

**The Golden Rule:** Good foot position and knee position allow access to body rotation; poor foot position and knee position deny access to rotation.

When rotation is restricted by poor setup, golfers typically compensate by:
- Standing up out of the shot
- Overswinging with arms (losing control)
- Overrotating the lumbar spine (causing back pain)

## Key Tips: Foot Position (Foot Flare)

### The Biomechanics of Foot Flare
1. **Both feet pointing straight forward:** Restricts pelvis motion in both directions
2. **Right foot open:** Provides more backswing rotation but restricts follow-through rotation
3. **Classic Hogan setup (right foot forward, left foot open):** Restricts backswing rotation but enhances follow-through rotation
4. **Daffy Duck principle:** "The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away" - opening one foot gives access in one direction but takes away access in the other

### Finding Your Perfect Foot Flare
**The Jump Test (Mike Adams Method):**
1. Take a jump forward
2. Notice how your feet naturally land
3. This landing position shows how your feet want to be positioned for maximum pelvis rotation in both directions

### Andrew's Personal Example
- Andrew's right foot turns out significantly when he jumps (due to limited right hip mobility compared to left hip)
- His optimal position: "two or three minutes to one" on a clock face
  - Left foot: very slightly turned out
  - Right foot: turned out more to accommodate hip restriction

### General Recommendations
- **For most golfers with limited mobility:** Right foot needs to be slightly turned out to allow proper backswing rotation
  - Provides more rotation and radius in the swing
  - Creates speed and power
  - Allows space to swing club from inside on downswing
- **Maximum flare:** Don't exceed approximately 15 degrees from straight forward
- **Right foot pointing forward (no flare):**
  - Only suitable if you have excellent hip mobility
  - For most, this position restricts backswing and forces compensations
  - Makes it virtually impossible to swing from inside
- **Hogan/Woods setup (right foot forward, left foot open):**
  - Appropriate only if you have no mobility or stability issues on backswing
  - Tiger Woods famously used this when setting up for maximum power shots
  - Prioritizes follow-through rotation over backswing rotation

## Key Tips: Knee Position (Knee Flex)

### The Dangers of Incorrect Knee Flex
1. **Too straight (locked knees):**
   - Denies access to pelvis rotation in both directions
   - Risk of lower back pain
   - Stretches hamstrings excessively (not good for lumbar spine)

2. **Too deep (knees over toes):**
   - Also denies access to rotation
   - Creates compensations: arm swing, upper body swing, standing up out of shot
   - **Most common setup problem Andrew sees**

### Finding Your Perfect Knee Flex

**Step-by-Step Setup:**
1. Stand straight up and down
   - Notice knees are already in a slightly flexed position (natural comfort stance)
   - Legs are not locked out
2. Bend from your hip joint to address the ball
   - Keep the same knee flex from your standing position
   - Maintain weight under your shoelaces
   - Don't change the relationship of lower leg to ground (stays approximately 90 degrees to ground)
3. Adjust only if necessary
   - If hamstrings are tight or short and the position is uncomfortable
   - Add just a little more knee flex to relieve hamstring strain
   - **Keep knee flex to a minimum** for full access to rotation

### Why Too Much Knee Flex Is Dangerous
When knees go too far forward over toes:
- Pelvis rotation becomes blocked
- Body must compensate by:
  - Standing up to access rotation
  - Overcompensating with arm swing
  - Over-rotating from the back (pelvis not coming along) causing back problems
- The lumbar spine tries to rotate more than it should, leading to soreness

### Andrew's Personal Approach
- From standing straight position, he bends back
- Knees go slightly forward to relieve tight hamstring strain
- Not so much that it denies access to pelvis rotation
- "Standing straight, hips back" is the natural position to aim for

## Exercises/Drills with Step-by-Step Instructions

### Exercise 1: The Jump Test for Foot Flare
**Purpose:** Discover your natural foot position for maximum rotation

**Steps:**
1. Stand naturally
2. Jump forward
3. Land naturally without thinking about foot placement
4. Look down at how your feet have positioned themselves
5. Note the angle of each foot (this is your body's natural preference for rotation)
6. Use this position (or similar) when setting up to the golf ball

**What to observe:**
- How much your right foot turns out
- How much your left foot turns out
- The difference between the two (indicating mobility differences between hips)

### Exercise 2: Natural Knee Flex Discovery
**Purpose:** Find your optimal knee flex for rotation

**Steps:**
1. Stand straight up and down (normal posture)
2. Notice the natural slight flex already in your knees
3. Without changing knee position, bend from your hip joints
4. Let your hips move back as you bend forward
5. Keep weight centered under shoelaces
6. Check that your lower leg relationship to ground stays approximately 90 degrees
7. Test rotation from this position - can you rotate freely?
8. If hamstrings are too tight, add only a minimal amount of knee flex

**Testing your position:**
- Try rotating your upper body - does pelvis come along smoothly?
- Do you feel blocked or able to turn freely?
- Is your back comfortable?

### Exercise 3: Foot Position Comparison Test
**Purpose:** Feel the difference between various foot positions

**Steps:**
1. **Position A - Both feet straight forward:**
   - Set up with both feet pointing straight ahead
   - Try to make a backswing turn
   - Notice the restriction in both directions

2. **Position B - Right foot open:**
   - Turn right foot out
   - Try backswing - should feel easier
   - Try follow-through - should feel more restricted

3. **Position C - Hogan setup (right forward, left open):**
   - Right foot points straight, left foot turns out
   - Try backswing - should feel more restricted
   - Try follow-through - should feel easier

4. **Position D - Your jump test position:**
   - Set feet to where they landed in jump test
   - Try rotation both ways
   - Should feel most natural and allow best access in both directions

### Exercise 4: Knee Flex Extremes Test
**Purpose:** Understand the boundaries of poor knee flex

**Steps:**
1. **Too straight:**
   - Lock legs nearly straight
   - Bend from hips
   - Try to rotate - notice severe restriction
   - Feel hamstring stretch and potential back strain

2. **Too deep:**
   - Bend knees significantly forward over toes
   - Try to rotate - notice you're blocked
   - Feel how you want to stand up or overswing arms

3. **Optimal position:**
   - Stand straight, notice natural knee flex
   - Bend from hips keeping that flex
   - Try to rotate - should be smooth and free

## Common Mistakes Addressed

### Mistake 1: Right Foot Pointing Forward for Everyone
**Problem:** Many golfers keep right foot pointing straight forward thinking it's the "proper" setup
**Reality:** Most golfers with limited hip mobility need right foot turned out to access backswing rotation
**Fix:** Do the jump test to find your natural foot position

### Mistake 2: Too Much Knee Flex (Most Common Issue)
**Problem:** Knees pushed too far forward over toes when addressing the ball
**Consequences:**
- Blocks pelvis rotation
- Forces standing up during swing
- Creates arm swing compensations
- Can cause back problems
**Fix:** Stand straight first, then bend from hips without changing knee angle significantly

### Mistake 3: Copying Professional Setups Without Considering Mobility
**Problem:** Trying to use Hogan or Woods setup (right foot forward, left foot open) without their mobility
**Consequences:**
- Severe restriction on backswing
- Difficulty rotating
- Unable to swing from inside
- Compromised stability
**Fix:** Assess your own mobility and use foot position that allows rotation in both directions

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Tight Hamstrings
**Problem:** Keeping minimal knee flex despite tight hamstrings, causing lumbar spine stress
**Consequences:**
- Lower back pain
- Forced lumbar rotation
- Risk of injury
**Fix:** Add small amount of knee flex to relieve hamstring tension while maintaining ability to rotate

### Mistake 5: Going Too Extreme with Foot Flare
**Problem:** Turning feet out beyond 15 degrees from straight
**Consequences:**
- Can restrict early phase of downswing (if right foot too open)
- Can restrict backswing (if left foot too open)
**Fix:** Keep foot flare moderate, around 15 degrees maximum from straight forward

### Mistake 6: Locked Straight Legs
**Problem:** Standing with legs completely locked out at address
**Consequences:**
- No rotation access
- Hamstring overstretching
- Lumbar spine stress and potential injury
**Fix:** Allow natural slight knee flex present in comfortable standing position
