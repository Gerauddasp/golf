## Overview

This short instructional video presents a simple yet effective golf swing drill using an inexpensive training aid - a tee. Andrew Cullen demonstrates how to use a tee stuck in the end of a golf club grip to develop proper backswing mechanics, right arm rotation, and delivery position. The drill emphasizes the sequential movements of the club during the swing, particularly focusing on the right pocket reference point and the flip to the ball.

## Key Concepts

### Main Training Drill: The Tee Pointer Method

**Setup:**
- Insert a tee into the end of the club grip
- Use the tee as a visual reference point throughout the swing

**Backswing Phase:**
- Point the tee toward the right pocket for as long as possible during takeaway
- Maintain this right pocket alignment throughout the early backswing
- The extended alignment helps establish proper swing plane and connection

**Transition Phase:**
- As the right arm begins to fold naturally
- As the right arm rotates during the backswing
- The tee position will flip/change direction

**Delivery Position:**
- The tee flips to point at the ball (or just outside the ball)
- Final tee position depends slightly on which club is being used
- This creates the ideal delivery position at impact

## Technique Breakdown

### Right Arm Mechanics

**Elbow Function:**
- The right elbow plays a crucial role in the delivery
- Proper folding of the right arm creates leverage
- Rotation in the right arm generates power

**Energy Transfer:**
- Speed is delivered through proper body rotation
- Energy flows from body through connection to club head
- The drill emphasizes maintaining connection throughout

### Key Movement Pattern

1. **Takeaway:** Tee points to right pocket
2. **Backswing:** Maintain right pocket alignment as long as possible
3. **Transition:** Right arm folds and rotates
4. **Downswing:** Tee flips to point at ball
5. **Delivery:** Optimal position at impact

## Practice Application

### How to Use This Drill

1. **Preparation:**
   - Find a tee
   - Insert it securely in the end of your club grip
   - Start with slow, controlled swings

2. **Focus Points:**
   - Watch the tee throughout the motion
   - Feel when it points to right pocket
   - Notice the natural flip as arms fold
   - Confirm it points at ball at delivery

3. **Progression:**
   - Start with half swings
   - Progress to full swings
   - Eventually internalize the feeling without the tee

## Notes

This is a quick, actionable drill video (just over 1 minute) that provides an immediately applicable training method. The emphasis on using an inexpensive tee as a "very expensive training aid" (said sarcastically) highlights Andrew's practical, accessible teaching approach. The drill addresses common swing faults while being simple enough for golfers to practice on their own.
