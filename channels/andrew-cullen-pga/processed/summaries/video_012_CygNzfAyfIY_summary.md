## Overview

This video addresses a common frustration among golfers: why practice swings often look and feel much better than the actual ball swing. Andrew Cullen explains the psychological and physical reasons for this discrepancy and provides three mental solutions to help golfers transfer their smooth practice swing to their ball swing.

## Key Problem Identified

**Why Practice Swings Feel Better:**
- **Practice Swing = 1 Task:** Simply creating club head speed
- **Ball Swing = 3 Tasks:**
  1. Creating club head speed
  2. Striking the ball
  3. Sending it in the right direction

**The Result:** More complexity leads to more stress and tension, which causes:
- Shortening of muscles
- Top shots
- Poor sequencing
- Difficulty with directional control

---

## Three Mental Solutions

### Solution #1: Feel the Club (Spatial Awareness)

**The Problem - "The Blind Spot":**
- Many golfers lose awareness of where the club is in space during the transition
- In practice swings, the club flattens naturally on the downswing
- In ball swings, tension causes the club to be in a completely different position

**The Solution:**
- Develop awareness of where the club is in space throughout the swing
- Feel the club's position during the transition from backswing to downswing
- Allow gravity to help the club fall naturally where it wants to fall
- Focus on feeling the club flatten during the transition (moving from upright to flat)
- Reference to "beautiful angel angle" - optimal coordination between body, hands, arms, and club

**Key Concept:** By feeling where the club is in the practice swing, you can translate that same feeling into the ball swing.

### Solution #2: The Scotty Scheffler Game Face

**The Technique:**
- Keep mouth very slightly open from start to strike
- No showing of teeth, no tension in the jaw

**The Benefits:**
- Loosens muscles in the cheeks and face
- Relaxes the shoulders, hands, and arms
- Makes proper sequencing much easier

**Understanding Sequencing:**

**Based on Throwing Motion:**
- Like throwing a golf club down the range (or Happy Gilmore's running start)
- Proper sequence: Ground → Hips → Body → Arms → Hands → Club head

**The Throwing Sequence Breakdown:**
1. Plant the lead foot (left foot for right-handed golfers)
2. Push into the ground
3. Create rotation in the hips and vertical force
4. Rotation and leverage in the body
5. Hands and arms follow
6. Release/deliver the projectile (club head to ball)

**Golf Swing Application:**
- Move left through transition (like a thrower)
- Push into the ground creating rotational and vertical force
- Upper body rotation follows
- Leverage in the right arm (for right-handed golfers)
- Deliver club head to the ball

**Key Insight:** Keeping the upper body soft and hands soft allows this natural sequencing to occur without conscious thought. The slightly open mouth helps maintain this softness.

### Solution #3: Look at the Low Point

**The Logic:**
- Ball is on the ground
- Leading edge must hit underneath the equator of the ball
- Low point of the swing needs to be at or just after the ball
- If you focus on the top of the ball, your subconscious tries to hit the top of the ball

**The Technique - "Hit Some Small to Get a Few T's":**
1. Place a tee in front of the ball
2. Focus on hitting the tee (the low point) from start to strike
3. The ball strike becomes a natural consequence

**Why It Works:**
- Changes the task from hitting the ball to hitting a specific low point
- Reduces stress and anxiety
- Not trying to get the ball up or send it straight
- Just focusing on making contact with the tee/low point
- Takes mental pressure off hitting the ball itself

**Alternative Focus Points:**
- A piece of grass in front of the ball
- A specific spot on the mat

---

## Bonus Tip: Driver Low Point

**Different Approach for Driver:**
- Low point is in a different place (before the ball on upswing)
- Instead of looking ahead of the ball, look at a specific point ON the ball
- Orient the ball so you're looking at the back/bottom portion
- Example: Focus on the blue logo on the back of the ball
- This helps you hit the ball on the upswing rather than at the bottom of the arc

---

## Recommended Combinations

Andrew suggests using these solutions individually or in combination:

**Combination 1:** Awareness of the club (Solution #1) + Game Face (Solution #2)
**Combination 2:** Game Face (Solution #2) + Looking at low point (Solution #3)

**All solutions share a common theme:** Reduce mental complexity and physical tension to allow natural, instinctive movement.

## Key Teaching Points

1. **Instinct Over Mechanics:** When there's less stress, your natural instinct creates good movement
2. **Gravity as an Ally:** Allow the club to fall naturally rather than forcing positions
3. **Simplify the Task:** Change from hitting the ball (complex) to simpler focus points
4. **Relaxation is Key:** Physical tension from mental stress ruins sequencing
5. **Practice Swing Quality:** You already have a good swing; you just need to access it under pressure

---

## Practical Application

**On the Course/Range:**
1. Choose one solution that resonates most with you
2. Practice it on the range first
3. When you feel comfortable, apply it on the course
4. Consider combining solutions for even better results
5. The game face technique can be used with any of the other methods

## Target Audience

- Golfers who have good practice swings but struggle with ball swings
- Players dealing with tension and anxiety over the ball
- Those struggling with:
  - Top shots
  - Inconsistent contact
  - Poor sequencing
  - Directional control issues

---

## Underlying Philosophy

This video reflects Andrew Cullen's approach to golf instruction:
- **Mental solutions over purely technical ones**
- **Simplifying complex movements through focus changes**
- **Working with natural instincts rather than against them**
- **Reducing stress to improve performance**

The core message: Your practice swing is proof that you can make a good swing. These mental strategies help you access that same quality when the ball is present by managing the additional psychological pressure.
