**Series:** Putting tip number 21 of 100
**Duration:** 81.80 seconds

## Overview
Andrew Cullen challenges the conventional wisdom of "lag putting" and advocates for always trying to hole every putt, regardless of distance. He argues that visualizing the ball going in the hole, rather than just getting it close, leads to better instinctive distance control.

## Key Concepts

### The Anti-Lag Philosophy
- **Main Argument:** "Why on earth would you try and miss the hole?"
- Andrew questions the traditional approach of lag putting where golfers aim to just get the ball close
- He believes that always trying to hole the putt produces better results

### Visualization Technique
- **Always visualize success:** Picture the ball going in the hole from wherever you are on the green
- **Instinctive distance control:** By focusing on a successful outcome (holing the putt), your natural distance control improves
- **Specific entry point:** Visualize exactly where the ball will enter the hole (in this demo, at "5:00" on the clock face)

### Practical Application
- **Long putt demonstration:** Andrew demonstrates on a 25-meter putt with right-to-left break
- **Focus on feel at strike:** Concentrate on the feeling at impact to get the distance right
- **Visualize the ball "dying over the edge"** at the specific entry point
- **Result:** The putt nearly goes in, leaving a tap-in

## Technical Details

### The Example Putt
- Distance: At least 25 meters
- Break: Right to left
- Entry point visualization: 5:00 position on the hole
- Outcome: Excellent pace control, nearly holed

## Key Quotes
- "Lag schmag. Why on earth would you try and miss the hole?"
- "If you're always visualizing a successful outcome from wherever you are on the green, however far away you are, then you're going to get your instinctive distance control right."
- "Was I trying to lag it? Was I? Hell, I'm trying to hold it."
- "We got to try and hold it from everywhere to try and get your pace right."

## Coaching Philosophy
Andrew's approach emphasizes:
1. Positive visualization over conservative strategy
2. Trusting your instincts over mechanical technique
3. Always playing to win (hole the putt) rather than playing not to lose (lag it close)

## Practical Takeaway
Instead of thinking "lag putting" on long putts, always visualize the ball going in the hole at a specific entry point. This mindset shift leads to better natural distance control and occasionally you'll hole these long putts instead of just getting them close.
