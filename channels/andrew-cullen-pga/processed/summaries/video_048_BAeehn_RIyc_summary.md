## Key Putting Tips

### Tip 11: Don't Make a Practice Swing
- **Concept:** Trust instinctive distance control like throwing a ball
- **Problem:** In putting, we look at the ball instead of the hole
- **Solution:** Make the last look at the hole the most important one
- **Execution:** Look at hole, then immediately react without delay or conscious measurement
- **Goal:** Develop natural feel for distance rather than mechanical stroke measurement

### Tip 12: Pre-Round Practice Routine
**Building Confidence with Short Putts:**
- Use a tee in the ground as a target
- Start 10-15 cm away, progressively increase to 1 meter
- Hitting a tee builds confidence for hitting the hole

**Getting Pace/Speed:**
- Ignore holes on practice green
- Practice stopping balls at the fringe from various distances
- Try uphill, downhill, and sidehill putts
- Goal: Develop feel for green speed before round

### Tip 13: Aim Club Face Precisely
- **Key Point:** Club face direction is more important than swing path
- **Demonstration:** Even with poor swing paths (outside-in or inside-out), proper face alignment sends ball on target
- **Practice Methods:**
  - Cheap: Use alignment stick on ground
  - Investment: Use putting alignment tool (pro tutor)
- **Goal:** Ensure club face is 90° to target line

### Tip 14: Check Swing Path Consistency
- **Practice Location:** Use flat edge of green (or wall/alignment sticks)
- **Ideal Path:** Inside-square-inside relative to target line
- **Technique:** Swing from the sternum (small movement creates big club head movement)
- **Avoid:** Too many moving parts (butt, lower half, head movement)
- **Result:** Consistent path combined with proper face aim = accurate putting

### Tip 15: Get Your Eyes Aligned
- **Proper Setup:** Eyes should be parallel to target line
- **Common Mistake:** Tilting head to look at hole instead of turning head
- **Problem:** Tilting causes eyes to go offline, leading to pulled putts
- **Checklist:** Align club head, body, AND eyes

### Tip 16: Keep Your Mouth Soft
- **Technique:** Mouth slightly open, cheeks soft, tongue soft
- **Benefit:** Increased feel and touch for delicate putts
- **Application:** Especially useful for difficult putts (downhill, breaking putts)
- **Goal:** Enhanced pace control through relaxed state

### Tip 17: Putting from the Fringe
- **Philosophy:** "Worst putt is always better than worst chip"
- **Challenge:** Getting pace right through different grass textures
- **Phil Mickelson Technique:**
  - Look at edge of fringe (where it meets green)
  - Then look at hole
  - Then look at ball
  - Repeat: Fringe-hole-ball-GO
- **Purpose:** Feed subconscious information about resistance change from fringe to green

### Tip 18: Thumbs Grip
- **Source:** Taught by Jean Jacques (biomechanist, David Leadbetter associate)
- **Technique:** Fit the joints of thumbs together into natural arc
- **Benefits:**
  - Beautiful roll on ball
  - Ball "sticks to grass" as it takes off
  - Enhanced left-right side coordination and rhythm
  - Smooth roll without jumping
- **Feel:** Ball sets off smoothly rather than bouncing

### Tip 19: Ball Position
- **Key Point:** Position relative to STERNUM, not feet
- **Goal:** Hit ball just past low point, with club slightly ascending
- **Rule:** Low point is always opposite the sternum
- **Position:** Ball underneath left eye (for right-handed players)
- **Check Method:**
  - Put second ball in left pocket
  - Set up to first ball normally
  - Drop second ball from left eye
  - Should land on top of first ball
- **Result:** No backspin, clean roll without jumping

### Tip 20: Ball Against Fringe (Texas Wedge)
- **Problem:** Difficult to get clean contact with putter when ball is against fringe
- **Solution:** Use pitching wedge (or 9-iron) like a putter
- **Technique:**
  - Hit ball on equator or just above
  - Can see bottom edge of wedge better than top edge of putter
  - Hold pitching wedge like putter
  - Make normal putting stroke
  - Get no grass between leading edge and ball
- **Benefit:** Much easier than chipping and more reliable than putting with grass interference
