## Overview
Andrew Cullen's 19th putting tip focuses on the correct ball position for putting, emphasizing that positioning should be based on body alignment rather than foot placement.

## Key Points

### Main Concept
- **Ball position is related to sternum, not feet** - The critical reference point for ball position is the sternum, not foot placement
- **Hit ball after low point** - The goal is to contact the ball just as the putter passes its low point and starts moving slightly upward

### Technical Details
- **Low point is opposite the sternum** - The lowest point of the putting stroke naturally occurs at a position opposite to where the sternum is positioned
- **Ball under left eye (for right-handed players)** - The ideal ball position is directly underneath the left eye
- **Creates proper roll** - This position allows the ball to roll smoothly without backspin or jumping

### Practice Method
Andrew provides a simple drill to check ball position:
1. Place a second ball in your left pocket
2. Address your putt normally
3. Drop the second ball from your left eye
4. If positioned correctly, it should land directly on or very close to the ball you're putting

### Benefits
- Eliminates backspin that causes the ball to jump
- Promotes a smooth, true roll
- Ensures consistent contact point in the stroke
