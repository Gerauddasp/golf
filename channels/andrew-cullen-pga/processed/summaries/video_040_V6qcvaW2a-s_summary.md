## Overview
Andrew Cullen explains how to optimize the low point in your golf swing to strike irons more consistently and powerfully, inspired by Scotty Scheffler's technique. The lesson focuses on controlling the horizontal (x-axis) position of the low point through proper body positioning.

## Key Concepts

### The Low Point Theory
- **Critical Position**: The low point must be at the ball or just after it (target side)
- **Sweet Spot Contact**: Leading edge needs to hit underneath the ball's equator (around 3rd-5th groove)
- **Problem**: If low point is behind the ball, you get fat shots, thin shots, and inconsistent contact
- **Three Dimensions**:
  - X-axis (horizontal) - today's focus and "non-negotiable" for ball striking
  - Y-axis (vertical up/down movement)
  - Z-axis (club head distance from body)

### Andreas Cali's Low Point Concept
Credit to Danish coach Andreas Cali for the core teaching method:
- **Center of chest** and **center of pelvis** position relative to the ball determines low point
- Club bottoms out opposite these body centers
- Club head reaches lowest point opposite the left armpit (where swing radius is greatest)
- Divot starts at center of chest/pelvis and deepest point at left shoulder

## Two Technical Fixes

### Exercise 1: The Alignment Stick Drill
**Setup:**
- Place alignment stick in ground next to right leg (diagonal angle)
- Right foot stays against the stick

**Purpose:**
- Prevents excessive rightward shift during backswing
- Makes right thigh bone the axis of the backswing
- Makes it easier to get center of chest and pelvis forward on downswing
- Promotes ball-first, divot-second contact

### Exercise 2: The Skater Move
**Concept:**
- Like pushing off back skate on ice to move forward
- Push under right foot to move left during transition

**Timing:**
- Start pushing left BEFORE backswing is complete
- This is what creates Scheffler's exaggerated forward movement and "funky footwork"
- So much pressure in left foot causes reactive movements (left foot sliding, right foot following)

**Result:**
- Center of chest and pelvis move forward
- Low point positioned correctly
- Pure, powerful ball striking

## Three Instinctive Practice Tips

### Tip 1: The Towel Drill
- Place towel on ground about one club head width behind ball
- Goal: Hit ball while missing the towel
- Encourages center of pelvis and chest forward at strike

### Tip 2: Hit the Forward Tee
- Place broken tee 4-5 cm (2 inches) ahead of ball
- Focus eyes on the tee, not the ball, from start to strike
- Try to hit the tee away, collecting ball on the way
- Trusts instinct to position low point correctly

### Tip 3: Eyes Ahead (No Props)
- Look at grass 3-4 cm ahead of ball instead of at ball
- No towel or tee needed
- Provides mental freedom - not thinking about "the hit"
- Naturally positions low point correctly
- Focus point becomes instinctive low point location

## Key Takeaways

1. **X-axis control is non-negotiable** for consistent ball striking
2. **Don't shift right** on backswing - use right thigh as axis
3. **Push left early** - skater move before backswing completes
4. **Forward body position** - center of chest and pelvis at or ahead of ball at impact
5. **Use instinctive drills** - towel drill, forward tee, eyes ahead technique

## Scheffler Connection
Scotty Scheffler exemplifies these principles with:
- Extreme forward movement during downswing
- Already moving left while still in backswing
- Dramatic weight transfer creating visible foot movements
- Center of mass well forward at impact
- Consistent, powerful ball striking as a result
