## Overview
Andrew Cullen reveals a signature move used by elite golfers like Annika Sorenstam, Tiger Woods, Brooks Koepka, Bryson DeChambeau, and Rory McIlroy: the proper use of the right arm in the golf swing. This technique creates leverage, rotation, club face control, and effortless power.

## Key Concepts

### The Two Roles of the Right Arm

1. **Creating Leverage (Speed Generation)**
   - Two levers work like a hammer motion to deliver speed to the club head
   - Lever one comes out first, lever two comes out second
   - The later you release these levers, the more speed you generate through impact

2. **Rotation (Additional Speed)**
   - As the arms swing back and the right arm bends, it also rotates
   - Similar to a tennis player's motion
   - Rotating the arm back and then through creates additional speed

## The Signature Move: Right Arm Straight Longer

### Annika Sorenstam's Technique
- Keep the right arm straight for as long as possible on the backswing
- Focus on right arm (not the commonly mentioned left arm)
- When the right arm stays straight longer, it will fold DOWN instead of BACK
- Folding down creates rotation in the forearms

### Benefits
- Power moves needed for downswing delivery
- Delivers club at speed on a consistent swing path
- Control of the club face
- Better coordination between arms and body
- More speed transferred through body to club head
- Creates momentum to send the club flatter on the way down

## The Mike Adams Drill

### Setup
1. Take your normal stance and grip position
2. Open the right hand completely (don't cheat by wrapping fingers around the grip)
3. Keep only light contact between palm and grip

### Execution
- Make a backswing with the right hand completely open
- This naturally produces:
  - Longer straight arm
  - Elbow folding down (not back)
  - Arms rotating without manipulation
  - Body engagement in the backswing

### Common Fault
- Pulling with the right hand causes the elbow to fold back behind you
- This loses leverage and rotation
- Makes it difficult to create speed and deliver the club from the correct direction

### What You'll Feel
- Body very engaged in the backswing
- Elbow folding late and downwards
- Lovely rotation of the arms
- Momentum of the club going to a flatter plane on the way down

## Key Sequence

1. **Setup:** Beautiful setup position
2. **Backswing:** Right arm longer and straight
3. **Transition:** Elbow bends down, arms rotate
4. **Delivery:** Leverage and rotation deliver effortless speed

## Additional Resources
Andrew mentions a video from Andreas Calli about body position relative to the ball for great strikes.

## Conclusion
By keeping the right arm straight longer in the backswing (rather than focusing on the left arm), you create the conditions for beautiful delivery through leverage and rotation, resulting in effortless power and control.
