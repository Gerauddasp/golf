## Overview
Andrew Cullen shares a visual training drill for improving driver swing path using a marked ball to promote an inside-to-out, upward attack angle.

## Key Teaching Points

### The Red Cross Drill
- **Setup**: Draw a big red cross on the golf ball
- **Ball Position**: Place the cross NOT square on the tee
  - Turn it towards you slightly
  - Angle it down a little bit
- **Purpose**: Encourages an inside and upward attack with the club head

### Mental Focus Simplification
- Instead of thinking about complex swing mechanics (radius, torque)
- Simply focus on hitting the red cross with the club head
- Provides a clear visual target from start to finish

## Technique Benefits
1. **Inside Path**: The cross orientation promotes an inside-to-out swing path
2. **Upward Attack**: Positioning helps achieve the optimal upward angle of attack for driver
3. **Simplified Focus**: Gives a single, clear visual target to concentrate on
4. **Reduces Over-Thinking**: Eliminates need to consciously think about technical aspects

## Target Audience
- Golfers struggling with outside-in swing path
- Players who over-analyze swing mechanics
- Anyone looking to improve driver contact and distance

## Practical Application
This is presented as a "bonus tip" drill that can be practiced on the range to ingrain the proper swing path feel without getting bogged down in technical thoughts during the actual swing.
