- **Instructor:** Christo Garcia (Ben Hogan Method specialist)
- **Location:** `channels/classic-golf-swing/`

**Content:**
- **Master Summary:** Complete integration of all 5 lessons (grip → stance → backswing → downswing → summary)

- **8-Week Practice Progression:** Systematic program for mastering each fundamental
- **Practice System:** Drills, tracking templates, progression guides
- Raw transcripts and detailed summaries available

**Hogan's 5 Lessons:**
1. **The Grip** - Two-grip system (palm/fingers), swing wreckers warning
2. **The Stance** - 90% of shot in setup, weight in heels, foot angles
3. **The Backswing** - Sequence (hands→arms→shoulders→hips), pane of glass, rear leg brace
4. **The Downswing** - Hips initiate, lateral shift first, ground-up power
5. **Integration** - Complete swing as chain reaction of fundamentals

**Highlights:**
- Based on Hogan's legendary "Five Lessons" book (1957) - most influential golf instruction book ever written
- Sequential building block approach: master each fundamental before moving forward
- Christo Garcia rebuilt his entire swing with this system → earned Ben Hogan sponsorship
- Precision mechanics with specific positions and checkpoints
- Timeless fundamentals proven by one of history's greatest ball-strikers
- 8-week practice program for systematic mastery

**Hogan's Philosophy:**
> "I didn't get really good until I stopped trying to do many things perfectly and instead focused on executing a few simple principles very well."

## 🔄 Channel Comparison

### Four Complementary Teaching Approaches

Each channel excels in different areas - use them together for complete golf instruction:

| Aspect | Andrew Cullen PGA | Me and My Golf | Classic Golf Swing | Athletic Motion Golf |
|--------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Philosophy** | "Not everyone is the same" | "Diagnose then prescribe" | "Master fundamentals sequentially" | "Here's what the data shows" |
| **Teaching Style** | Feel-based, natural movement | Fault correction, practical fixes | Traditional, mechanical precision | Data-driven, scientific |
| **Technology** | Minimal, observation-based | Launch monitor validation | Classical methodology | 3D motion capture, force plates |
| **Content Format** | Quick tips, mnemonic devices | Problem → solution drills | Sequential building blocks | Detailed biomechanics breakdowns |
| **Terminology** | Simple, accessible | Practical with some tech | Classic fundamentals | Technical, anatomical |
| **Best For** | On-course quick reference | Fixing specific faults fast | Building swing from scratch | Understanding technical "why" |
| **Strengths** | Practical "how" with feels | Immediate, measurable results | Systematic fundamentals | Scientific "why" with data |
| **Unique Value** | Mnemonics (G.R.I.P.S., etc.) | TPI + tour player insights | Ben Hogan's timeless method | 3D motion capture analysis |

### Using All Four Channels Together

**The Complete Learning Path:**

1. **Building from Scratch?** → **Classic Golf Swing** (Hogan's sequential fundamentals)
2. **Diagnose Your Issue** → **Me and My Golf** (Fault Diagnosis Flowchart)
3. **Understand Why It Happens** → **Athletic Motion Golf** (biomechanics)
4. **Learn How to Fix It** → **Me and My Golf** (drill progressions)
5. **Simplify for the Course** → **Andrew Cullen PGA** (feel cues, mnemonics)

**Example: Complete Beginner Building a Swing**

1. **Classic Golf Swing:** Follow Hogan's 8-week program (grip → stance → backswing → downswing)
2. **Athletic Motion Golf:** Understand biomechanics behind each fundamental
3. **Me and My Golf:** Add drills for specific weaknesses discovered
4. **Andrew Cullen PGA:** Simplify for on-course with mnemonics

**Example: Fixing a Slice**

- **Me and My Golf:** Launch monitor shows 6° left path, 3° open face → prescribes specific drills
- **Athletic Motion Golf:** Explains biomechanical reasons (early extension, steep shoulder plane, grip issues)
- **Classic Golf Swing:** Check Hogan's grip fundamentals (swing wreckers active?)
- **Andrew Cullen PGA:** Simplifies to "feel the club wrap around body" (G.R.I.P.S. mnemonic)
- **Result:** You understand the problem, know root causes, fix fundamentals, and have simple feels

**When to Use Each Channel:**

- **Starting golf or rebuilding swing?** Start with **Classic Golf Swing** (Hogan's systematic fundamentals)
- **Struggling with a fault?** Use **Me and My Golf** (fault diagnosis + immediate fixes)
- **Want to understand mechanics?** Reference **Athletic Motion Golf** (scientific explanations)
- **Need on-course simplicity?** Use **Andrew Cullen PGA** (mnemonics, quick tips)
