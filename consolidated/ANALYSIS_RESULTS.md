## 🏌️ TASK 1: DRIVER ANALYSIS

### Sources Found:
- **Andrew Cullen PGA**: 8 files with driver content
- **Athletic Motion Golf**: 18 files with driver content
- **Me and My Golf**: 8 files with driver content
- **Classic Golf Swing**: 0 files with driver-specific content

### Key Consensus Points:
1. **Hips Initiate Downswing** - Universal agreement across all channels
2. **Ball Position**: Inside lead heel (all channels agree)
3. **Attack Angle**: +3-5° ascending (hitting UP on ball)
4. **Weight Transfer**: Essential for power generation

### Critical Discoveries:
- **AMG Finding**: Driver needs 0-2° shaft lean at impact (NOT 8° like irons!)
- **Me & My Golf**: Stop-at-Top Width Drill prevents 90% of slices
- **Ben Hogan**: "The swing is down below" - hips control everything
- **Andrew Cullen**: Rib stretch creates natural power

### Best Drills by Channel:
1. **Stop-at-Top Width Drill** (Me & My Golf) - Primary slice fix
2. **Nuclear Bag Drill** (Me & My Golf) - Face closure for blocks
3. **Belt Grab Drill** (Hogan) - Hip sequence training
4. **Split-Hands Backswing** (AMG) - Prevents casting
5. **Rib Stretch Drill** (Andrew Cullen) - Natural rotation

### Conflicting Advice:
- **Grip Pressure**: Cullen says 3/10, Me & My Golf says vary by shot
- **Finish Position**: Modern (low) vs Traditional (high)
- **Speed Generation**: Fast backswing (Me & My Golf) vs controlled (traditional)

## 🌲 TASK 2: FAIRWAY WOODS ANALYSIS

### Sources Found:
- **Me and My Golf**: 3 videos (mostly driver-focused but with relevant concepts)
- **Athletic Motion Golf**: 5 videos with specific fairway woods instruction
- **Andrew Cullen PGA**: 8 videos (mostly driver but with applicable principles)

### Key Discovery - Attack Angle:
**PGA Tour Standard**: 0° (neutral) angle of attack
- NOT ascending like driver (+3-5°)
- NOT descending like irons (-3-6°)
- Perfect sweep motion required

### Primary Drill:
**Tee Clipping Drill** (AMG - appears in 3 videos)
- Place tee flush with ground
- Sweep without breaking = perfect
- Broken tee = too steep
- Missed tee = too shallow

### Tempo Finding:
"Don't rush the transition" - longer shaft needs more time

---

## 🔷 TASK 3: HYBRIDS ANALYSIS

### Limited Content Found:
**Extremely sparse coverage across all channels**

### Key Sources:
1. **Andrew Cullen**: B.L.E.N.D. mnemonic created
2. **AMG**: Brief note - "follow fairway wood principles with slightly more descending blow"
3. **Me & My Golf**: Question raised but not answered
4. **Classic Golf Swing**: No content

### Answer to Key Question:
**"Should hybrids be hit more like woods or irons?"**
- Evidence suggests TRUE BLEND
- Attack angle: 0 to -2° (between woods and irons)
- More like fairway woods in approach
- More like irons in ball-first contact

---

## ⚙️ TASK 4: IRONS ANALYSIS (Most Comprehensive)

### Sources Found:
- **41+ files** containing iron-related content
- Most detailed coverage across all channels

### Universal Agreements:
1. Ball-first contact (non-negotiable)
2. Descending blow required
3. Weight forward at impact
4. Different setup from driver

### Key Channel Strengths:
- **Me & My Golf**: Best for consistency (Connected Takeaway, Set to Point drill)
- **AMG**: Best biomechanics (lead shoulder 2-2.5" forward at impact)
- **Andrew Cullen**: Best feels and cues (eyes 3-4cm ahead)
- **Ben Hogan**: Best fundamentals (sequential learning)

### Primary Drills:
1. **Set to Point Drill** (Me & My Golf) - #1 for fat/thin fixes
2. **Connected Takeaway** (Me & My Golf) - Eliminates heel strikes
3. **Weight Through Laces** (Me & My Golf) - Stability
4. **Eyes Ahead** (Andrew Cullen) - Low point control
5. **Lead Shoulder Forward** (AMG) - Compression

### Critical Finding:
**Chicken Wing as Primary Fault** (Me & My Golf)
- Causes 80% of inconsistent contact
- Just 2" of compensation = fat vs pure
- Set to Point drill immediate fix

## 🔪 TASK 5: WEDGES ANALYSIS

### Sources Found:
- **Andrew Cullen PGA**: 4 videos
- **Athletic Motion Golf**: 8 videos
- **Me and My Golf**: 3 videos (including Russell Henley system)
- **Classic Golf Swing**: Limited content

### Russell Henley System (Tour-Level):
- 5-yard increment practice (90, 95, 100, 105 yards)
- Clock positions (9:00, 9:30, 10:00, 10:30)
- Choke down 1" on ALL wedge shots
- "Less loft = more consistency" principle

### Distance Control Methods:
1. Clock system (backswing length)
2. Progressive swing calibration
3. Jim McLean immediate feedback drill
4. Tempo matching principle

## 🎯 TASK 6: CHIPPING ANALYSIS

### Content Distribution:
- Extensive coverage across all channels
- Different philosophies identified

### Three Distinct Approaches:

#### 1. Andrew Cullen - Simplification
- ONE moving part (chest rotation only)
- Same posture as full swing (critical!)
- Arms "stuck to sides"
- Distance = turn size

#### 2. Athletic Motion Golf - Classification
**Number One (Chip)**:
- Hands high, square face
- Straight back low path
- Maximum roll

**Number Two (Pitch)**:
- Hands normal, open face
- Toe-up backswing
- Height + spin

**Flop Shot Secret**: Long & SLOW tempo (not just open face!)

#### 3. Me & My Golf - Practical
- Setup determines outcome
- Weight distribution critical
- Russell Henley wedge integration
